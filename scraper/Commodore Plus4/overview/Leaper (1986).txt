Leaper is based on the game Jumping Jack where you have to get to the top of the screen by jumping through the moving gaps in each level of platforms. In this version the idea is to reach the top of the screen six times, and with each completion, a letter from the word Leaper lights up. You have an energy bar and this decreases if you touch the sides of the screen, don't jump up through a gap cleanly, fall down a gap cleanly or fall down a couple of levels. Once the energy bar is empty then you lose one of five lives. There are also various creatures moving along various platforms and if these are touched then you lose a life.
