Project Nova is a 1st person shooter where you are the pilot of a space craft and you must explore various sectors to find alien ships and destroy them. Before you play the game you can select which level you want to start on (1-8). You start the game looking out into empty space inside the cockpit of your craft with the option to look out from the rear. On your instrument panel which is shown on the top and bottom of the screen is your energy status, speed, your rating, shield status, view and how many hostiles in the area. Pressing 0-9 on the keyboard controls your speed but uses up energy so must be used carefully. Pressing F1, F2 or F3 activates your shield from Green (No Shield), Amber (20% capacity) and Red (Full) which also requires the use of energy.  Pressing C brings up your ships computer which gives a status report on various parts of your craft and a map of the area containing all the sectors. Each sector contains a number telling you how many hostiles are in that area and also which ones contain energy to top up your energy supply. These sectors can still contain alien ships. You move a cursor onto the sector you require to explore and press H for hyperspace. Once you are in the sector you use the joystick to control your craft to move a laser sight and pressing fire to fire a laser. You are also able to repair your ship if you receive damage but receive to much and it is game over.
