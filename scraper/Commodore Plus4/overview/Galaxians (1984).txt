Quicksilva have produced an excellent version of Galaxians for the ZX81. The action is fast and responsive, and it is a pleasure to play.  Two types of galaxians move, in formation, across the top of the screen, and swoop down, attacking your base. You have three lives available, while the speed, firing-rate and the number of swooping Galaxians are adjustable by the player.  Points are scored, in the usual fashion, by blasting the Galaxians as they fly. However, more points can be scored if the Galaxians are hit as they swoop down from the top of the screen.  Scoring is displayed on the screen, and at the end of each game, your score is entered into a league table which can cater for up to fifteen games/players.  The first batch of swooping Galaxians are particularly good at searching out an destroying your base, and some deft manoeuvring is required to avoid their attack. Thereafter the battle is fierce but a high score can be achieved by the experienced player. If it becomes too easy, the level of difficulty can be soon increased.
