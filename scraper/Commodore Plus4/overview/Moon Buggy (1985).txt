This wholly character-graphics free software game retains elements of Atari's classic Moon Patrol.  Like its predecessor, this title sees a little lunar cart rolling across a moonscape.  Furthering similarities not only in theme but gameplay, it also features bounding in low gravity over potential crash-causing craters and shooting at extraterrestrial navigational hazards through the use of keyboard commands.
