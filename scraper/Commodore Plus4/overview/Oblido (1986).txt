Oblido is an arcade puzzle game where you have to move four sets of nine counters made up of different colours and patterns into the same coloured reception area over various levels. The game is viewed from above with the whole level shown on the screen as a maze and each level has to be completed within a time limit using a cursor. The maze is made up of two areas which are coloured blue and grey and you can move anywhere through blue areas but are unable to enter grey areas so you must use the pathways to move to different parts of the level.  The counters are scattered all over each level and can only be pushed through blue areas but you are able to push as many counters as you like in a line. As you are pushing counters, sinners move about the pathways from a sin bin and if you touch one then you lose time and it is game over when the time runs out. You have the ability to fire at the sinners to kill them but they can also fire back if you are anywhere on the level which loses more time when shot.
