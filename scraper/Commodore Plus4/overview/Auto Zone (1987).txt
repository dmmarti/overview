"You are trapped on a supposedly dead moon and your only means of escape is to drive your small highly versatile surface buggy across the many treacherous sectors of the Auto Zone."  This is a horizontally scrolling platformer game, where the screen keeps scrolling automatically to the left as your vehicle (called the XL-Procon) is progressing forward. You have to guide the vehicle by making it jump over gaps and onto higher platforms to avoid collision with walls or fall into the water. There are two speeds you can travel with, so you can adjust your jumps to the appropriate situation. The game features 16 levels and colorful graphics comparable to Atari 8-bit standards.
