Wimbledon is a tennis game that allows you to play a friend or the computer for one match. Before you play the match there are various options you can select which are difficulty (1-4), how many sets (1-3) and speed of the match (1-4). The actual match is viewed from above with the whole court shown on the screen. The player serving presses the fire button and the serve is played automatically. The player returning the ball can move around the court and when they want to hit the ball they hold down the fire button (the longer held the harder the shot) and when it is let go this hits the ball. The direction the ball goes is the position of the player when they hit the ball. All the normal rules and scoring for tennis are used.
