In a land of dinosaurs and hardships, humans have to be tough to survive but unfortunately a new breed of human has started appearing 'The Wimp'. Unable to hunt, these men need a special vitamin to keep them alive but these are in dangerous places with many hazards. You play one wimp, Mr. Puniverse as you attempt to collect vitamins in this flick-screen platform game. One or two players take it in turns after a loss of life trying not to let your energy bar decrease fully or you lose one of eight lives and you lose a life if you fall from a height. There are objects that fire at you and pillars that move up and down, and if these are touched then a life is also lost.
