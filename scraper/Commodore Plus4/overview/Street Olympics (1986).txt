Street Olympics is a one player game that allows you to participate in four different events trying to beat the records. There are two running events, one running and jumping, and a throwing event and you can play them all one after the other or practise each one.   The first two running events are 200m sprint and 800m jogging. You waggle the joystick (or keyboard keys) left and right as fast as you can. There is a distance bar that lets you know how far left to run. There is a beep and the clock stops when you have completed the run but you have to stop waggling to stop or you will just keep running.  The running and jumping event has you waggling the joystick to run but when a obstacle appears then you press the fire button to jump. The throwing event has you running waggling the joystick and when you reach the line you hold the fire button down and a angle chart appears. Let go of the fire button at the best angle and you throw the object.  Each event is viewed from the side as your athlete moves from left to right with the screen scrolling as you move.
