Pin Point is based on the game Spindizzy where you control a spinning top over ten flick-screen isometric levels to reach a white flag. Each level is a route of platforms and you must guide the top without falling of the edges within a time limit. If you fall of the edge then you start at the beginning of the level wasting valuable time. You must be aware of the inertia of the top as it will keep moving after moving downhill so the joystick will need pressing in the opposite direction. To get up some hills or clear gaps you can give a little burst of speed by pressing the fire button.
