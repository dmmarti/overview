Every year a vicious biker gang has a race. You are fed up with this gang taking over so in your souped up car you become the Road Warrior. You must drive along the road shooting the bikers down. Remember to keep an eye on your fuel. If you don't kill a certain amount of bikers, when you stop for fuel you are killed. The game is viewed from above your vehicle as you control your speed and steering with your joystick. Fire button fires your cannons. The screen shows apart from your vehicle and road, your speed, fuel, score and how many bikers to kill.
