Runner is a single screen platform game with various levels, where you control a spaceman with a jet-pac who must traverse over platforms and up ladders to reach the top of each screen and collect three keys. Once all three keys are collected you move to the next level. On each level there are nasties that roam around each screen and you will lose one of four lives when a nasty is touched but you can use your jet-pac to fly over them and it can also help you jump gaps.  When the jet-pac is being used its fuel decreases but the fuel increases when not in use. Falling from a certain height will also lose a life and when all are gone it's game over.
