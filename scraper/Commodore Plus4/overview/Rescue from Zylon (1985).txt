Deep underground on the planet Zylon, 28 geologists are trapped and with the water levels rising quickly, you have been tasked to fly your airship into the caverns and rescue them all. The game is flick-screen with each cavern shown on the whole screen viewed from the side with a passage connecting other caverns. You control the airship with your joystick and when you move the airship it keeps moving until you move the joystick in the opposite direction to slow it down and even stop.  Hitting any part of the cavern and walls gives you a damage point and when you collect ten then it is game over but rescue a geologist and it is reduced. As you explore and fly through the caverns there is a clock counting down showing the water level and as the clock gets lower, caverns will flood killing the men. If you touch the water then it is game over. Once you collect all 28 geologists and return to the surface you then attempt the next level which is the same layout but now introduces acid droplets which increase your damage. There are eight levels in total and each one introduces more acid and makes them fall faster.  As well as the main playing area you can also see your score, damage, ship-depth, hi-score, bonus for geologists rescued and the water depth. Before you play the game you can select which level to play and the control sensitivity of the airship.
