Skramble is a variant of Scramble (with the spelling changed for legal reasons). Apart from the obvious hardware limitations, this is a rather faithful copy of the original shooter. You fly your spaceship through a cave system (split up on five sections) filled with missiles that launch from the ground, radar installations and disturbing objects that fly in your path. Destroy them with your bombs and forward-mounted gun. All the while, you must keep track of your fuel level. Bomb fuel silos on the ground to fill up.
