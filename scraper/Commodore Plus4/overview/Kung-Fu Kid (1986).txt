The wicked Madanda has just awakened from a sleep of several thousand years, and as the hero, your job is to use your kung-fu skills to fight the thugs in each of the seven rounds before reaching him, and you have 99 seconds to complete each round. The thugs tend to attack you from behind as well as in front. As usual,  you have to defeat a boss at the end of each round in order to proceed to the next round. However, round six requires you to fight several bosses. Bonus points are awarded at the end of each round for the energy and time that still remains.
