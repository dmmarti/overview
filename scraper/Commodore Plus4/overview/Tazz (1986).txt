Players control Tazzman, a yellow, fun-loving dude who must navigating from room to room shooting bugs with his laser gun. Tazzman can only stand still and shoot in four directions, but cannot shoot while moving. Several hazards prevent Tazz from achieving his goal. Two nasties pursue Tazz, but he is supplied with bombs that he can use to wipe them out, as well as stop the walls from closing in on him. Once Tazz has killed all bugs on the screen, the left and right exits will open up, allowing him to escape into the next room before he is crushed. Every two rooms there is a bonus room which allows Tazz to collect all the numbers, obtain more bombs, and leave through either side.
