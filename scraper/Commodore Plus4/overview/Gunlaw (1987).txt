You are the only one left after a bloody alien attack and now with your weapon store emptied and destroyed you have to traverse over five levels of terrain to escape the aliens. Armed with just a gun you must shoot the enemy who are attacking you with your weapons, but you can take cover behind tree's, fences and houses. Gun Law is based on the arcade game Commando as you move vertically up each level. The game is viewed from above at an elevated angle and you use a joystick to control your soldier.
