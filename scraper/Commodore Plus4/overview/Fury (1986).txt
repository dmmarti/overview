Fury is a variant of the arcade game Time Pilot, and was programmed by Timothy Purves.    The player is the sole defender of a small South American country that is being overtaken by communists and has to shoot down as many enemies as possible before the CIA steps in. Like in the arcade game the player is in control of a plane that can move and shoot in multiple directions. Among the enemy forces there are airplanes, helicopters and hot balloons that can be shot down and parachutes that have to be rammed. As the game goes on it gets harder with the addition of magnetic air mines. These will chase the player who has to dodge them. The first one appears after scoring 5,000 points but the amount increases at higher point values. After scoring 30,000 points the player's air cannons heat up making it necessary to fire slower.
