You are the pilot of a plane that has run out of fuel and so your only option is to glide the plane down to land. Problem is the only place below is a city and so your only option is to bomb the city to remove the buildings. The game is viewed from the side on a single screen and your plane starts in the top left of the screen and moves across. When the plane reaches the right side it appears on the left but one place down. You must keep dropping bombs and if you touch a building it is game over.</Notes
