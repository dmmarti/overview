The deep space cargo vessel, Cygnus has been attacked by pirates from the planet Retipujeca who have killed all the crew and stolen all the cargo. As the incident was in your sector, you the leader of a Galaxy Patrol squad must board the vessel to investigate what happened on board. As the boarding hatch is damaged, and the only way to enter is with a backpack, you have also decided to go alone and to also prove your worth as a leader.

Cygnus is an arcade adventure where you must investigate three floors of the vessel, with each floor shown on the whole screen from above. You must move from room to room as quick as possible as there is only a limited supply of oxygen. Objects like keys can be found and used elsewhere on the vessel. Also on board are robots which move around the vessel and will shoot at anyone on board and if you are shot, touch a robot or run out of air, then it is game over.
