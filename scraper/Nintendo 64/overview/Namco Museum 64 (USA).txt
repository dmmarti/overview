No this isn't the 64th edition of Namco Museum, but it is a conversion of the series from the Playstation to the N64.

Included in this version of the series are Pac-Man, Ms Pac-Man, Dig Dug, Pole Position, Galaga and Galaxian.

And as usual you can dig into past info, sketches and pics for each title in the museum.
