The idea for this game is that you must build barriers on the arena to stop the water from leaking out. As you go along, rain starts to fall onto the arena, so you better keep the walls as high as possible. Too much on the screen, though, will start and earthquake. Ice blocks fall to freeze the water. Bombs drop, leaving holes in your walls and fireballs dry up the water. Simply go as long as possible to get as high a score as you can. There is a practice mode available, and you can play against a friend.
