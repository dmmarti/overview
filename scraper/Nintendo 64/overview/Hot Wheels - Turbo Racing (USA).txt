In Hot Wheels: Turbo Racing you can race over 40 classic Hot Wheels cars, some looking sporty and some not. Race through 11 tracks filled with loops and danger chargers.

Cars and tracks are unlocked as you play, either by winning races or performing stunt flips, side rolls and combos. Two player races can either be pure head-to-head, or also feature the computer cars. The soundtrack is rock-based, including tracks by Metallica and Primus.
