In this 3d 1st person adventure game, Castle Shadowgate is filled with thieves and other scum and, on top of it all, there's an evil wizard who intends to release the Warlock lord!

You assume the role of Del Cottonwood, a halfling adventurer. He becomes a prisoner of Castle Shadowgate after a raid on the caravan he was traveling with.
