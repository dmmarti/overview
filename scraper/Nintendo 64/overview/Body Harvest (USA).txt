In 2050 AD, the earth has been taken over by horrible aliens, who long ago planted the humans there to later devour, and the last remains of humanity are working on a desperate plan - to send a genetically engineered soldier back into the past, and help hold back the invasion. But, as the final preparations for this Alpha Command operation are underway, alarms light up in the orbital control-station where the last humans hide - the aliens are back for dinner...

You have to explore the world, through ancient ruins and deserted lands, find hidden secrets, drive all kinds of vehicles and stand against the alien invasion to save the earth.
