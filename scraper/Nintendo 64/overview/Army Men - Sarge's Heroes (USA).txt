But in the chaos, Sarge's entire team of elite soldiers has been kidnapped by the Tan.  Worse yet, the Tan have made an amazing discovery: blue portals that lead to the real world!  They use these portals to take amazing weapons of war from the real world into the plastic world including magnifying glasses, deadly robot action figures, and fire crackers.  Its up to you, as Sarge, to rescue your team and put an end to the blue portals and Tan's evil schemes.
