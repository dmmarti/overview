1.  Arcade - you must simply select one of the 3 difficulty settings, one of the available cars and compete with the other 8 CPU players for the first place. Each difficulty setting has 3 races and the place you manage to get at the end of each race is carried on to the next one. Car damage does not apply in this mode. 

2. Championship - you race in a total of 9 rounds with 3 laps per round. In each round you get points depending on what position you finished in and in the end these points are accumulated to decide your final ranking.
