Brilliant water effects and excellent control highlight this gorgeous racing pak for the N64. You'll feel the pounding and crashing of the waves as you accelerate into straightaways, whip around pylons and fly off ramps. Don't race alone. Challenge a friend in two-player mode! 

 Wave Race 64's nine challenging courses are packed with marker buoys, ramps, mines, hairpin turns, sand spits and more. As you proceed through Championship mode's three difficulty levels, the courses get tougher and your rivals become more aggressive. Things start out easy in the tranquil lagoon of Dolphin Park. Soon, you'll battle the slanting light of Sunset Bay, race through the fog banks of Drake Lake, skip from wavetop to wavetop in the choppy Marine Fortress course, make a late-night run through the neon-lit Twilight City, skid across the ice floes of Glacier Coast and even fight Southern Island's treacherous tide! 

In Stunt mode, you'll master dazzling tricks while riding through red-and-white rings. You can do a handstand and roll, flip or helicopter your Jet Ski. If you're good enough, you'll even get to ride a dolphin! Test yourself in Time Trial mode.  Wave Race 64 gives you a choice of four riders, each graded according to four capabilities: grip, handling, acceleration, top speed and collision stability. You can customize each rider's Jet Ski and even select how rough the waters are. You can't do that in real life! 

You can save your circuit progress, best times and custom settings on the Game Pak, then transfer the results to a Controller Pak and play at a friend's house.
