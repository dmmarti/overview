Kirby's adventure for the Nintendo 64 is a polygonal side-scroller similar to Klonoa - however, unlike Klonoa, the game only follows one set path instead of multiple branching paths.  In this game, Kirby can still copy the abilities of his foes - but in addition to this, he can combine these abilities with others to make unique combinations.  (For one example, combining electricity and ice will turn Kirby into a fridge that spits out food.)

The story begins with Dark Matter assaulting a faraway land for their special crystal.  A young fairy called Ribbon takes the crystal and escapes to save it.  She lands in Dream Land, but pieces of the crystal have shattered and landed all across the world.  Kirby volunteers to help and together they go to find all the missing pieces.

Kirby will encounter his friends, who have been controlled by Dark Matter.  He'll have to battle them to rescue them.  From there, they travel together to other different worlds, including Rock Star, Water Star, and Ripple Star, Ribbon's home world, where Dark Matter is lurking.  To properly finish the game, players must find all the hidden crystal shards tucked away in the various levels.  Only then will Kirby and his friends truly save Ripple Star.
