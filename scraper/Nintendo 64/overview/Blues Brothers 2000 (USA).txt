This platformer with a Blues Brothers theme loosely follows the plot of the film. You have to escape the prison and get the band back together in order to participate to the "Battle of the Bands" competition.

You accomplish that by jumping over obstacles, beating a lot of people and collecting coins, notes, wrenches, keys and whatnot in four levels; Prison, Chicago, Graveyard &amp; Swamp. After each level you will free one new band member. Additionally, they throw in some rhythm action, where you have to press the right buttons at the right time in order to proceed. The game features multiplayer, but you only get to play the rhythm mini-game.
