They've been fighting for years in on our TV screens, and now you can join in on the fight.

Tom & Jerry, plus a collection of well known supporting characters from the cartoon show, are part of this all-on-all brawl, where the best use of usual household appliances and furniture can win you the game.

Each level (including the Kitchen, a deck of a sailing ship and a lounge room decked out in Christmas decorations) includes a range of platforms to use to get out of the way of the firing line, and a heap of items to use in order to bash the living furball out of the enemy. Things like eggs, frying pans, chairs, bottles, roasted turkeys are all available for use in more ways then one.
