4 games are waiting for you in this sequel to the first Castlevania Nintendo 64 adventure. Although at war with the same enemy in the same castle, you must fight as 4 different characters to save the day, with improved graphics and a new look to certain areas that appeared in the original.

To begin with, set 8 years before the events that took place in Castlevania, the Count has kidnapped the young sister of Cornell, a powerful werewolf. As Cornell, you must battle your way through the castle and defeat Dracula to save your sister.

Once completing the game as Cornell, you take up the role of Henry, a demon hating hero who must save captured children from the hands of Dracula within a set time limit.

After that, you can then take on Dracula once again as the original heroes of Castlevania 64, Reinhardt Schneider and Carrie Fernandez, and re-live the events of the previous game through new and improved surroundings.
