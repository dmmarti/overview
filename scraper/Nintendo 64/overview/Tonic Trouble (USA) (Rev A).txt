In the tradition of Rayman (a platform jumper) comes another whacky adventure from Ubisoft!

Ed, the friendly alien space janitor, accidentally dropped a can of "tonic" on Earth, causing a great ecological disaster. Everything started mutating! Ed is ordered to clean up the place and retrieve the tonic, but someone got hold of it first... And he declared himself Master of Earth! Can Ed survive attack of the killer vegetables, find the six items he needs to fix Earth, and retrieve the Tonic can from Grogh the Hellish, and finally get out from Tonic Trouble?
