Aidyn Chronicles: The First Mage follows the story of Alaron, poisoned by mysterious goblins while out on patrol in the grounds of King Loyd's kingdom. Without a common cure, Alaron must set out on a journey with a selection of companions in search of the antidote. Little does Alaron know that the journey is even more dangerous then first thought, with a mysterious evil force brewing in the distance.

A 3D fantasy role playing game, you must complete a set of quests, through the use of items and magic, while following a slightly non-linear storyline, in which you choose in what order the tasks can be completed. The game features two distinctive different modes: exploring and fighting. Alaron explores the game world freely, discover special places and talk to its inhabitants. There are no random encounters but if he meets an enemy the game switches to the combat screen. Combat is basically turn based but not in the usual console RPG way: during a character's turn he can be moved in real-time in a circular way - the characters move constantly towards each other. When two rings intersect the characters can launch a regular or magic attack. The party selection (up to four characters) is pre-defined by the story.
