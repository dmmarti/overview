WCW/NWO Revenge is the much anticipated sequel to THQ's smash "WCW Vs NWO: World Tour". With greatly improved graphics, animation, roster, control and much anticipated 40 man 'battle royal', Revenge is a definite step up over it's predecessor.

Take control of one of 50 WCW wrestlers (and 10+ fictional wrestlers) such as Sting or Hollywood Hogan and battle through for any of the 5 different title belts with full statistical tracking of wins/losses/draws and new replay mode you can gloat in your victory or powerful move over and over again.
