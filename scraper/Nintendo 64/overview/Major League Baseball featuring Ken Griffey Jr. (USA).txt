The full Major League Baseball is on display in this mainly arcade style baseball title. All teams and players are available for exhibition, season and world series modes. Up to two players can play through these modes, with a further two for 4 player home run derby, where the winner is determined by the amount of balls you can whack out of the park.

Ken Griffey Jr. supplies his motion captured moves and voice to the game, along with team stats tracking through-out the season.
