Michael Owen's WLS 2000: World League Soccer is a soccer game for the Nintendo 64. In the game you can choose to play one of over 200 teams from various countries in custom cups.

The game features two modes of control: easy and professional. The latter allows you to perform a wide array of over 23 different special moves and maneuvers. Controls allow you to shoot, pass and sprint. Unlike other soccer games you cannot choose which player you want to control when on the defense, the decision is made for you.

The later released US version of the game, named Mia Hamm Soccer 64, had all the player models replaced with female versions and all team names changed.
