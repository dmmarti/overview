In the tradition of F-Zero and Wipeout, AeroGauge is a sci-fi racer that pits you and a friend in a fast paced race to the finish through futuristic tracks and among detailed craft, acting more like planes than racers as they skim many metres above the ground. Play solo through the grand prix and compete against the AI enemy, or beat down your best time in the time trial mode. 

Each track features a number of twists and turns, whether it be racing upside down or vertically, with a number of obstacles in your path. There's no weapons, though, it's just you and the open road ahead.
