Kobe Bryant teams up with Nintendo for a second time. For this update to NBA Courtside, all the team and player statistics, moves and jersey changes have been added to the available roster, etc. 

There are now more options available for each play mode, such as the ability to play multiple seasons in the regular season mode, play a Three-point contest, as well as more options when creating your own player in create-a-player mode.

Further improvements to the player movement, AI and animation have been made, including new moves such as the no-look pass and new dunk styles, once again motion captured from Kobe Bryant.
