California Speed has you racing through, of course, California, with a range of different and unique tracks based on the real life maps of the US state, with short-cuts and branching elements adding elements of strategy when racing to the finish line. Cars include the usual collection of fast cars, as well as F1 racers and golf-carts, and you can customize your car's paint job to suit your style.

Split screen two player racing is supported.
