After ending the terror of evil in Hyrule, Link sets out to find another quest to complete, but on his way he stumbles into the wait of another evil force. Link awakens in a dazed and confused state, missing his Ocarina and his horse, and seems to be cursed. To make matters worse, Termina, the world that he has ended up in, is about to be destroyed by the Moon in less than three days, taking the rest of the world with it, including Hyrule. It is up to Link to save the day again.

Time travel and mask hunting take a bigger chunk out of the quest compared to the last Zelda. Although there are only three days to complete the game, the player is able to travel back in time after finding the  Ocarina. Any items that were found and any quests that were  completed are either saved or lost, depending on importance. Certain Masks turn Link into powerful characters, each with their own advantages (like the Zora Link, who can swim underwater for very long periods of time). 

There are also plenty of sub-quests to complete and items to find, however the clock is always ticking away until the end of the world...
