In terms of features, the first of Electronic Arts' Madden series to appear on the Nintendo 64  is closest to Madden Football '98.  

Madden Football 64 was the most graphically advanced Madden game at the time of release.  Visual features include 5000 frames of animation and a HelmetCam view from the player's eyes. AI adjusts during the game to your playing style. You can create, deaft and trade a full roster of players.

The game does not have an NFL license, so all the teams are named by just the city name with no logos.  It does have a players license though, so all the real players are here.
