Race along both street and dirt circuits with a collection of top flight dirt-bikes and street bikes. Dirt-bike racing allows you to pull off tricks during racing to increase the amount of turbo boost available to use, while alternating between the different bikes available for each circuit. Compete for points to improve your bikes overall performance or purchase a better overall motorbike.

Trick attack mode allows you to simply concentrate on pulling off as many crazy tricks as possible, while you can create your own special track, with jumps and sharp turns, with the track editor.
