The FIFA series introduces itself to the Nintendo 64, with all the football/soccer action one can expect from an EA Sports title. Choose your team, whether it be Manchester Utd or Real Madrid, or even a lowly ranked team, and take them through the ranks of the professional sport right up to the crowned kings of their tournament. You can stick with the local leagues (five in all) or take your team onto the International circuit and compete against every team available.

FIFA Soccer 64 can be played by up to 4 players at a time.
