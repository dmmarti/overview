Welcome to Pok�mon Puzzle League! Being selected to participate in the Official Puzzle League Tournament is one of the greatest honors a Pok�mon Trainer can earn. In this brand new type of Pok�mon battle, you'll have to use your strongest Pok�mon to compete against the very best Trainers in Puzzle League Village. 

To succeed in Pok�mon Puzzle League, your fingers have to be fast and your brain has to work even faster. True Pok�mon Puzzle Masters will discover many ways to play the game, but the basic idea is to destroy puzzle pieces by matching up three or more blocks of the same color. 

The more puzzle pieces you eliminate at the same time, the more points you'll score. If you're battling another Trainer, you can send powerful attacks to their puzzle board by completing big Combos and Skill Chains. If you can't clear your stack of puzzle pieces before they reach the top of the screen, you're doomed. 

You'll discover many challenges as you travel through Puzzle League Village, from the exciting 3D Puzzle Mode to the brain-bruising exercises at Pok�mon Puzzle University. The best way to experience Pok�mon Puzzle League is to bring a friend along on your adventure. Heated two-player Pok�mon battles are so intense and action-packed that you just might forget to breathe! 

Are you ready for this new type of Pok�mon Battle?
