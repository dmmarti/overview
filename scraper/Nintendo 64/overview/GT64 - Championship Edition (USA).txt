GT 64, short for Grand Tour 64, is a 3D racing game for the Nintendo 64. It features cars and drivers from the All-Japan GT Championship season of 1997 as it is an officially licensed game.

There are three stages with each a long and a short version counting six tracks in total situated in Japan, the USA and Europe. All of them are located in urban settings. You can opt to race three, six, twelve or 24 laps on each track. There are fourteen cars available to race in and they can be manually tweaked to improve performance.

The Japanese re-release of the game includes two new tracks based on the 1998 season.
