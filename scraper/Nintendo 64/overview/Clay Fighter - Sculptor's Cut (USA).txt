Let's Get Ready to Crumble!

Clay Fighter: Sculptor's Cut is a parody of one-on-one fighting games and features sixteen playable clay (!) fighters, including Sumo Santa, Statue of Liberty, Booger Man and the legendary Earthworm Jim himself! It is the sequel to Clay Fighter 63 1/3 and famous for only being released as a Blockbuster rental exclusive.

Like the title suggests, it is not an entirely new game but rather a different version of it. The most notable differences are the four extra playable characters and a 2D-style fixed camera angle. You cannot perform unlimited combos anymore either.

Moves are a mix of standard punches & kicks (although not all of the contestants have hands nor legs to begin with) and a large number of unique special moves and combos for all. You can sometimes interact with your environment by kicking your opponent through a door or window and continue on the other side. You can also end the fights with Mortal Kombat-style "Claytalities".
