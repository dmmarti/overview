Race across six open tracks with many of the modern day high speed racing cars. The better you do in each race, the more money you have to spend to buy the faster cars, or to improve the car you have. Shortcuts litter the tracks, while nitro boosts help you to really fly down the main straights.

Up to 4 players can compete together against the computer controlled racers in the championship modes, as well as against each other seperatly
