Choose your favourite Nintendo character and take to the world of tennis. Game types include ring shot (where you must shoot the ball through golden hoops that are suspended above the play area, gaining bonus points as you play), bomb tennis (simply put Tennis with Bombs) and Piranha Challenge (much like the tennis machines which chuck balls at you, but in this case they are replaced with Piranha plants). Of course, there is your normal tournament mode, with up to 4 players in on the action, and some crazy arenas, especially Bowser's Castle, which is suspended above a lava pit!
