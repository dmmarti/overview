You play Magnus Gallant, who leads the revolution for the kingdom of Palatinus. The kingdoms lord, Holy Lodis Empire, is rumored to be planning the domination of the entire continent of Zeteginia. This creates concern among the people, and it is up to Magnus to rid the Lord from the kingdom, to free the people from slavoury forever.

A semi-sequel to the original Ogre Battle which came out on the Super Nintendo Entertainment System (SNES), and the third in the series, you don't actually control where the characters go, but you do control their actions and fighting techniques (much like Age of Empires and similar war-based titles). The main characters, Magnus, leads many troops into each battle, and you must control how each group attacks or defends, and if you wish to use straight forward attacks or magic. 

Depending on what you achieve, there are branching levels (much like Starfox 64), each with their own difficulty levels. The more battles you face and complete, the experience of each warrior in your team increases, so when you reach the latter levels, your team will last much longer against stronger opponants.
