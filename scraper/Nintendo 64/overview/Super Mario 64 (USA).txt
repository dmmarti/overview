Mario is invited to Peach's castle, but when he arrives Peach is nowhere to be seen. He soon learns from Toad that Bowser has once again kidnapped her. The Koopa King has also put a spell on her castle, imprisoning her subjects. So it is up to Mario to break the spell and rescue Peach.

Travel through many different worlds, fighting Bob-bombs, Koopas, and some new and interesting creatures.  You must enter each world by jumping into paintings. You have to collect stars to unlock more areas. Defeat Bowser on each floor to get a key to unlock big doors and enter more floors, which contain more areas. Work your way through the game, and then defeat Bowser to rescue Princess Peach.
