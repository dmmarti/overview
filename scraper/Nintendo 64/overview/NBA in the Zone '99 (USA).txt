Konami's second attempt of NBA basketball features all the options from the '98 title plus new motion captured moves, an icon passing system, on the fly play calling and up-to-date rosters and stats for the 98/99 NBA season.

A new three point contest is included to go with the Exhibition, Season, Playoff and All-Star modes.

All this and the voice of Chicago Bull public announcer Ray Clay.
