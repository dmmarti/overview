A gang of pirates have invaded Rayman's world to seize its unique creatures and sell them to an intergalactic circus. Our mighty hero, Rayman, has been captured and stripped of his powers. He flees captivity and embarks on a dangerous mission to return to his conquered world where he must liberate all of his imprisoned friends from the pirates.

Just like Bugs Bunny: Lost in Time, the game is rendered in full 3D and contains action, adventure and mind twisting puzzles!
