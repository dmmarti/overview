Big Mountain 2000 is a sports game where you can choose to race with either a snowboard or a ski. There are six characters (plus three unlockables) to choose from, each with different skills and three modes in total � two of them are single player and the other one is a multiplayer.

1. Championship: in Championship you can select one of the available players and choose the style you want � ski or snowboard.  You can also change each player�s equipment which includes ski/snowboard and clothes. The game also lets you choose in which stage you want to compete and the race type you want to play. Race Type includes three options � Free Ride, Slalom and Giant Slalom. In Free Ride you compete against 3 more CPU players, you must finish first and before time, which can be renewed at every checkpoint, runs out. In Slalom and Giant Slalom you must pass through the flags that are scattered throughout the course and again like in Free Ride finish first. The differences between the Slalom-Giant Slalom are the later�s course being wider and the flags less. By successfully completing any of the above your players skills like cornering, acceleration, etc. are increased.

2. 2P Battle: in 2P Battle two human players can compete in any of the Free Ride-Slalom-Giant Slalom races. It is possible to either choose a player from the game or load a previously saved player data from a Controller Pak. There are also no restrictions on the style each player will choose. For example one may choose to play with a skier and the other with a snowboarder.

3. Time Attack: there are no other competitors in this mode � just you racing against time.
