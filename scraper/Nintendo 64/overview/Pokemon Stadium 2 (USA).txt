Battles is the aim of the game here, as the crazy critters, more commonly known as Pokemon, return to the N64.

Once again, you have the option of building a team of battle ready warriors for a range of battles against other Pokemon trainers. Along the way, you will get the chance to fight for a range of Poke-cups, or take your Pokemon for a ride to a collection of mini-games for bonus prizes (or just for the fun of it).

4 players can compete in the one tournament, while the transfer pak allows you to upload your Pokemon that you have from the range of Pokemon Game Boy Games (including the original Pokemon Red and Blue, and the GBC Gold/Silver series). If you don't have the Game Boy games, you can choose from a selection of Pokemon straight out of the box to get into the fight without mucking around.
