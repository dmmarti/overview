Climb into a hover tank, and battle Soviets and aliens on the moon.  The premise of the game: The Soviets and Americans were actually fighting on the moon during the cold war, unbeknownst to the public.  You job is to command fleets of tanks against the Soviets and win the war.

There are 3 completely different modes to the game.  An arcade mode in which you fight ever increasingly difficult waves of enemies.  A story mode in which you are simply a pilot where you are told exactly what your orders are.  And there is also strategy mode, in which you can build units and send them off to do battle for you.

In addition to containing all the missions available in the PC version of this game, there is also additional missions that continue the story where the PC game left off.
