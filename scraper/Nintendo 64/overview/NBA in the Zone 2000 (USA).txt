The third in the In the Zone titles features all the usual options you come to expect from an NBA simulation title, including Season, Exhibition, Playoff, All-Star, Slam Dunk and three point shoot-out contests.

Fully licensed, the game features all the latest players, stats and teams from the NBA 99/2000 season, plus the icon-passing and on the fly play calling for a complete basketball game. Commentary again features the voice of Ray Clay.
