For the first time in history, NHLPA pros are descending upon the Olympic Winter Games. Be a witness as regular season opponents join together as teammates. Kamensky and Yashin are laced up for Russia. Kariya and Roy get the nod for Canada. Modano and Leetch are in for the United States. The rosters are real. The graphics will make you sweat. It's country against country in this engagement. And the price of glory isn't gonna be pretty!
