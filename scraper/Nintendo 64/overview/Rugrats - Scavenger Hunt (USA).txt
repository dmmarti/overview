Rugrats: Scavenger Hunt is a party game based on the Daytime Emmy-award winning animated television series Rugrats. The game features three distinct board games that are represented in 3D similar to Mario Party. On each board the objective is to find a missing item.

In Angelica's Temple of Gloom you have to beat Angelica in reaching various pieces of an Aztec statue. The Pirate Treasure hunt requires the Rugrats to travel underwater to find buried treasure. The Reptar Rally lets them collect candy on Candy Island.

The game can be played with up to four players (or NPC players). each turn you can move as many paces as you got on the spinner (a replacement for dice). Some tiles have special actions attached to them that let you move further or gain or lose cookies. Each Rugrat also has limited energy, when they move a lot they get tired and have to take a nap to regain energy. You can collect Toy Cards to open doors or use against friends to gain an edge.
