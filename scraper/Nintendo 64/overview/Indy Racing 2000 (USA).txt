Indy Racing 2000 is an officially licensed product of that year's Indy Racing League. At this point it purely raced on oval tracks, and featuring Indianapolis-style race cars - open wheel, open cockpit.

All 20 drivers and their cars and teams are authentic with fully licensed IRL tracks including night time tracks at Texas and Charlotte. Two player mode is supported and there is a unique draft meter to aid in making sling-shot moves for passing.

Top drivers are represented with detailed replicas of their cars. It is a racing simulation rather than a pure action game, letting you choose the angles of the front wing, rear wing, set the tire pressure, gear ratios and transmission type.
