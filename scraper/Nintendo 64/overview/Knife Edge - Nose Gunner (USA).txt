Battle your way through level after level of intense air and ground attacks, as you take control of a powerful airship, with the simple aim of defeating the enemy. Take out other airships and defense installations through areas from tunnels to martian like landscapes.

Unlike most shooters of this type, Knife Edge uses a unique camera perspective that automatically moves through the environment in front of you in order for quick target locks. And you don't control the ship itself, letting you concentrate on moving the target onto enemies ahead.

You can play the story mode by yourself or with 3 friends, each controlling a seperate ship for the battle ahead. A battle mode for 4 players is also included.
