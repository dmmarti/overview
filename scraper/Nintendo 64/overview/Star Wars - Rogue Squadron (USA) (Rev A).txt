Basically it's a flight sim in the Star Wars universe. You can choose your favorite craft before a mission starts: X-Wing, A-Wing, Y-Wing, V-Wing .... Mostly you are only able to complete a mission if you fly with the recommended craft. The mission objectives differ from escort missions to attacks on enemy bases etc. The coolest part is when you have to disable the huge walker with a rope ...
