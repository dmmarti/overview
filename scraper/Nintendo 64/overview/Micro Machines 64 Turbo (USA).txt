Conversion of Micro Machines V3, with added extras exclusive to the N64 version.

Race a selection of tiny toy vehicles (racing cars, tanks, boats and more) across the beach, garden and areas of the house, just like you would with the real Micro Machines toys.

Although in full 3D, the game is played from the top down perspective to allow to player to view more of the track as well as showing how small the Micro Machines really are. 

And although only four controllers are allowed on an N64, up to 8 people can play at any one time using what's called Pad Share (where one person uses one side of the controller, stearing with the Directional pad, while the other player uses the four C-buttons).
