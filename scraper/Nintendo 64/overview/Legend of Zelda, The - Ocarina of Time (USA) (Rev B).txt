For the first time, The Legend of Zelda makes its way to the N64, in fine fashion. Our hero Link is once again called for to save the Kingdom of Hyrule, and this time he has a time travel device called the Ocarina to help him in his quest. 

Ganon is once again up to his old tricks, and Princess Zelda, as well as the Great Deku Tree ask for Links help. To guide him, a young fairy called Navi shows him the tricks of the trade. You begin the adventure with the task of collecting your sword and shield, and then saving the Deku Tree from the evil that has attacked. From there, you travel to Hyrule, and the many worlds that stem from Hyrule Field.

There are many, many new things in this Zelda compared to past versions, including the use of time travel and the two different Links on each side (young Link, who you start the adventure with, and teen Link, who you must turn into to complete certain areas of the game). Weapons are also a key feature, with bombs, swords and other nifty gadgets available to help you in your quest.
