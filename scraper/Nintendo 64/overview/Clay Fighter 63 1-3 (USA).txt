In this zany beat 'em up, clay animated fighters clash in a fight to the clay death. Characters such as Bad Mr. Frosty (a snowman gone terribly bad), Blob (a green pile of slime), Bonker the nightmare clown and a host more are available to choose from, each with a range of moves that no clay animated character has ever attempted before (such as throwing chickens, clay, and plenty of other objects, including themselves).

Graphics are a combination of 2D clay animated characters and 3D designed foregrounds/backgrounds.
