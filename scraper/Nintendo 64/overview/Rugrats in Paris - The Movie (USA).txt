Rugrats in Paris: The Movie is based on the 2000 Movie of the same name, which in turn is based on the Daytime Emmy-award winning animated television series.

Unlike the PC and Game Boy Color spin-offs from the movie, the Nintendo 64 and PlayStation games are 3D platform games.

Tommy Pickle's father has been sent to Europe for maintenance work at Euroreptarland. The Rugrats join him on his travel to Europe. There are 16 levels and hidden bonus level to play through.

The game consists of various mini-games that have to be completed in order to earn enough tickets to beat the game. Most tickets, however, can just be collected by running around the park and picking them up. Tickets can be used to buy prizes. There are ten mini games including whack-a-ninja, bumper cars and mini-golf.
