Moving away from the usual in-ring wrestling action, WCW Backstage Assault is just that, one-on-one battles in locker rooms, bathrooms, outdoor arenas and much more. Each wrestler has his/her usual set of moves, plus the ability to use the surroundings and any items (chairs, tables, etc.) they can find.

You can create your own wrestler, modify an existing wrestler, or choose from a large collection of WCW talent, competing for special championship belts, or hardcore matches where every win opens up hidden secrets.
