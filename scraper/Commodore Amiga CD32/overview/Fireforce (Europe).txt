In Fire Force, you kit yourself out with a military alter-ego, beginning with the rank of Ensign, and progressing through 12 increasingly difficult (and violent) missions, earning medals, commendations and promotions for each on successfully completed.

Only the first four of the game's twelve missions are selectable. The objective, terrain and enemies change depending on the mission, with a full intelligence briefing for each available. The ide of the mission don't change much, you've basically got to kill everything or destroy a specific target, but the actual objectives do. one minute you'll be taking out an enemy bridge, the next seeking and destroying a cache of SAM missiles or assassinating an enemy dictator.
