Although Liberation was released for the Amiga computer, it was one of the few titles developed primarily with the Amiga CD32 in mind. Specifically, it features long cut-scenes, voice acting, and a CD-quality soundtrack - the title of which has been re-recorded by the original composer, Mark Knight, for the Amiga Immortal 4 remix CD.
