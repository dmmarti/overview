Diggers is a Lemmings-style puzzle game where you command five alien miners (from a choice of four clans) and various gadgets to dig for treasure. The game is divided in excavation areas. Each area has a set amount of money you must raise before moving into the next one. To do so, you must sell your collected treasure to the bank.

You select your "Diggers" by clicking on them with the left mouse button, and making them do a desired action by right-clicking on the screen and choosing from a icon menu.
