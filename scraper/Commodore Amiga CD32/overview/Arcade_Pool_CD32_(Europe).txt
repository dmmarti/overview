 An overhead viewed pool game designed to be easy to control. The game includes the most standard games of pool (UK and US 8-ball and the fast-paced 9-ball game), each with customisable rules, computer players of variable difficulties, and 2-player options.   There's also a Survivor mode, which is similar to the early Pool arcade game, in that you're playing alone and have to clear the table without missing more than 3 times. Speed Pool involved clearing the table as quickly as you can - 2 minutes can be considered a good time.  The game includes automatic enhancements for accelerated systems, those with more than 1Mb of memory, or the AGA chip set (so a standard A1200 wins on all 3 counts)
