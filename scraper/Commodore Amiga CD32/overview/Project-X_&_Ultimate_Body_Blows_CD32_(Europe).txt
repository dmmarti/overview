 This compilation contains Project-X: Six levels of horizontally-scrolling shooting await in this R-Type style action game. The attack waves vary in style, with some attacking you from quite fiendish angles.These give off blue power-up tokens, which are used towards selecting one of many weapons. There are 4 front-firing options (guns, plasma, magma and laser-beams - guns can be built up quickly but lack top-end power compared to the others) as well as speed-up (only requires one token), side-shot, up to 3 homing missiles, build (a quick super-destructive blast that only functions when you aren't using auto-fire) and stealth (a period of invulnerability). Ultimate Body Blows: A compilation of the original fighting game "Body Blows" and its sequel, available only for Amiga, "Body Blows Galactic". The game combines everything from its predecessors and adds more colors, improved graphics and music, more backgrounds and endings, giving the player a total of 22 characters (including the invincible Max and his true self, the Terminator T17) and many fixes.
