Global Effect involves building up a sound local economy before going out to attack other nations and rule the world. Cities must contain housing, food sources and power supplies, which is where it gets complicated. You can choose the environmental settings of the game, in a similar way to Civilization - an icy world or a post-apocalyptic one make things much tougher.
