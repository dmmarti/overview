You take the role of Jethro. The aim of the game is to make your way through each level of the game, overcoming the various Rabbits allies you will encounter. For every six levels of the game that you complete, you will be given a code so that he can continue his struggle at a later date. However, the Rabbits don't take too kindly to this, so they send their biggest and most dangerous followers to attack you just prior to him being given the code. To defeat these large beasts, use your spin attack to propel the missiles back at them. Watch out, as rocks are too heavy to bat with your tail and you will use an energy point in trying.
