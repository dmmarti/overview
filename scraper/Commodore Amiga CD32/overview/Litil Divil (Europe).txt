A little devil named Mutt is a rather lazy character who prefers to do nothing in his own cozy part of the underworld. However, his luck changes when he is chosen as the hero who must venture into a mysterious Labyrinth in the overworld and retrieve the Pizza of Plenty from there, so that his demonic friends will have enough capers and anchovies to eat.
