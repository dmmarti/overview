 This platform game has much in common with console games of the era. There are 4 worlds including ice, desert and fields, and have multiple routes through. The bad guys are cutesy. You get past them by spinning at them, although jumping over them is often sufficient. Power-ups on offer include speed ups, energy, food and water (Quik’s thirst and hunger are measured separately). The bonus levels involve jumping through time, by finding the right doors.
