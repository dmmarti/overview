You are Boris Verne, a normal guy who is been cast in a parallel universe because of your uncle's Virtual Dimension Inducer. There you'll have to find the fabled lost star as well as a way to defeat the Golden King...**This is a classic old-style adventure game with a point&click interface. It uses the Rotoscope system to manage game characters and scores really beautiful 256-colour graphic.
