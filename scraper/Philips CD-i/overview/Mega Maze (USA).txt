Mega Maze is a video game approach to the real-life games where you would turn a platform of a maze with a metal ball to miss the holes and reach the middle with a few twists. You control a steel ball, being chased by enemies balls who can destroy you by blowing up when they touch you.    You also have to avoid explosive traps, trap doors and electric sensors. You can even make dummy balls to attract the enemy balls or use them to set on a switch to keep weight on it, giving you time to get through a trap without being caught. It features 75 levels, each with either with one maze clear up to three mazes.
