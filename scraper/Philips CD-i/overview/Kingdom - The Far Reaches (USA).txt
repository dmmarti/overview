Venture into a fully-animated game world of wizards and specters, of bright steel and dark magic, of heroic deeds and base treacheries. You are Lathan, striving to restore an amulet of great power - now scattered throughout three kingdoms - and defeat the evil Torlock, whose reign of terror has vanquished your homeland. Collect items of power and magic, learn clues to determine friend from foe and strive to return Princess Grace Delight to the throne, as every move you make opens new vistas of awesome animation and the chance to conquer The Far Reaches!
