Golden Oldies I is collection of two games that mimic the game mechanics of classic arcade games. The games are:  Guardian, a remake of Defender.  Invaders, a remake of Space Invaders  Both games have modernized graphics over the original, while the gameplay stays mostly the same. In Guardian you fly around on a horizontally scrolling background shooting at enemies. In Invaders you hover about at the bottom of the screen and shoot enemies that come descending from the sky. There are three bunkers to hide in, until they are shot to bits.
