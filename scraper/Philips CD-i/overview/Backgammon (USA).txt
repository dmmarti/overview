Backgammon is a translation of the classical board game for the CD-i. The game allows the player to chose between three different opponents with each their own skill level. The game can be played in a first person perspective in which the opponents are displayed in an animated cartoon style. You can also play against a friend and choose for a top down view of the game board. A hint system is available when you don't know what to do and it is also possible to undo a turn when you change your mind.
