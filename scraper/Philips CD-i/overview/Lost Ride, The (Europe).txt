The Lost Ride is a rail shooter game where you are literally on rails. The player is put inside a futuristic roller coaster and has to shoot anything that might get in his way. The game comes with three different themes for its levels: Mine World, Aqua World and Future World. Each world has different seamless prerendered 3D backgrounds that feature as backdrops for the shooting action. At the end of each stage a Boss creature has to be killed, which will unlock a bonus ride. These random generated tracks are maze-like and require you to choose a direction at various points. They are presented in surround sound so they really feel like being inside a roller coaster.
