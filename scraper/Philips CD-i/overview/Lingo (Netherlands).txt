Lingo is a digital version of the TV game show of the same name. Like in the game show it is the objective to guess five letter words. You are only given the first letter. You get several tries and with each try the letters are marked which are correctly placed and those who appear in the word but at a different location. Within words you get to blindly draw a ball from a pool. There are 17 numbered balls that correspond with a numbers on a bingo card. There's a ball with a question mark that let the players pick a number at will. When the players complete a row or column they receive bonus points. There's also three red balls that passes the turn to the other player and three green balls. A green ball allows you to pick another ball and also when you get three green balls before the game is over you win a jackpot. The game starts with two players, but after some rounds the player with most points goes to the finale. The game is in Dutch so only features Dutch words. It contains a library of 15,000 words. There's also options for six and seven letter games. It is officially licensed by the Dutch iteration of the game show and thus includes the Dutch TV presenter FranÃ§ois BoulangÃ©.
