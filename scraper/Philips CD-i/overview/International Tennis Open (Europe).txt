More of a simulation than an action game, with a multimedia showcase (the game's got thousands of mini-videos, voiceovers, etc.).     You select one of 9 nations to represent and get to play singles against a variety of opponents (no doubles play) in either practice mode, quick match, or tournament. Practice is pretty self-explanatory, quick match allows you to select your opponent (among 4 fictional players) and the type of court (concrete, grass, clay). While on tournament mode you select a host city from around the world and start playing from the quarter-finals on.    You view the action from a 3rd-person perspective and in-game graphics consist of 2-d rotoscoped-animated sprites.
