Link: The Faces of Evil is a video game developed by Animation Magic and released for the Philips CD-i in 1993. It was developed in tandem with, and released on the same day as The Wand of Gamelon, and followed up a year later by Zelda's Adventure, which was developed separately by Viridis Corporation. A product of a compromise between Nintendo and Philips due to their failure to release a CD-ROM based add-on to the Super Nintendo Entertainment System, The Faces of Evil, alongside the other two, are the only licensed The Legend of Zelda games developed for and released on a non-Nintendo system. The games have been subject to much criticism, and Nintendo does not recognize them as canon to The Legend of Zelda series.
