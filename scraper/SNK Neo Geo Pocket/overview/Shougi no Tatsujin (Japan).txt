Syougi (usually transliterated as shogi) is "Japanese chess" - a turn-based board game (the board has 9x9 squares) very similar to normal chess, but all pieces are different. There we have: -1 king -1 rook -1 bishop -2 gold generals -2 silver generals -2 knights -2 lances -9 pawns. Each unit has own move and all units are weaker than chess counterparts (for example Knight/Horse can't go backward), but all figures can be promoted and gain new moves. The player must defeat the enemy's king. Master of Syougi is an electronic version of this classic board game, where players can choose fight characters to fight and change several rules.
