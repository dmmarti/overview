Using the Japanese "SD" (Super-Deformed) artwork style, the KOF Series makes your debut in SNK's monochrome handheld bringing the same gameplay characteristics found in its arcade/console counter-part The King of Fighters '97, like the possibility of choose between two game modes (Advanced or Extra), an identical adaptation of the battle stages, the chance to battle against Leona and Iori in their Orochi-versions and the same storyline involving the New Faces Team (Yashiro Nanakase, Shermie and Chris), that are using the tournament to accumulate enough energy to wake up his supreme master: Orochi.
