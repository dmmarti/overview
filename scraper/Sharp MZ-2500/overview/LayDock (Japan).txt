Two jet fighters go on a mission together, each managed and controlled by a different player. The jets can be docked side-by-side or end-to-end for greater fire and fighting power. When docked one player is the pilot and the other is the weapons officer. The game can also be played by a single player. When you progress in the game you can select more advanced weapon systems to fight the over 50 different enemy characters.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NGGZr4nxUg
