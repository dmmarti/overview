Hover Attack is a multi-directional shooter in which the player has to transfer a mobile base through a hostile level towards the exit. The base itself can fire an unlimited amount of short-ranged missiles, but has limited manoeuvrability. In order to be able to withstand the constant enemy onslaught, the player must release the pilot from time to time, and have him explore the location on his own, leaving the base behind.     The pilot is equipped with a jetpack and can therefore jump much higher than the base, and generally move faster and more efficiently. He can fire independently of his movement, and his missiles are long-ranged. Three different shot angles are bound to three keys on the keyboard: up, straight, and down. The pilot, however, can fire only a limited amount of missiles, and will also run out of fuel for his jetpack. He will have to return to the base to recharge his ammo and to refuel.
