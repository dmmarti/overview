Captain America: Super Soldier combines a highly athletic combat system with fluid platforming and a highly tuned suite of shield attacks, as Cap explores a massive castle turned military installation. His shield can be employed in numerous ways: taking out multiple enemies at once, deflecting incoming fire back at enemies, solving puzzles, and scaling walls. Players will be able to launch shield-first into the fray with the superior force of the world s first Super-Soldier at their fingertips and they will need every bit of that strength to overcome a castle that s both an acrobatic playground for the Captain s physical prowess and a house of mystery with enemies and danger at every turn.
