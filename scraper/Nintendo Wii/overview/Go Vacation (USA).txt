In Go Vacation players explore four paradise resorts hosted on Kawawii Island: Marine, City, Mountain, and Snow. Over 50 activities are available on the island including bungee jumping, ice fishing, scuba diving, miniature golf, tennis, off-road racing, and snowman building. In the bungee jumping mini-game, players are challenged by needing to brake as close to the ground as possible. The island can be explored at leisure and navigated by walking, rollerblading, or riding on an ATV.
