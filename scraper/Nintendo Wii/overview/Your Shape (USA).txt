Your Shape is a revolutionary new fitness product that is laser-focused on you, ensuring you get the most personalized, effective and fun workout possible. The Your Shape camera comes with the game and, using proprietary fitness tracking technology, scans you, giving you a full body shape analysis. The game combines that analysis with the results of your fitness test and your goals to create a personalized fitness program to help you meet your goals as efficiently and effectively as possible. Unlike any other fitness product, when you begin your workout, the camera projects your image onto the TV. Because the camera tracks your movements, your coach can give you real-time input on how you re doing and advice on how to do it better. And, you get all of these benefits without having to hold a controller as you workout, leaving your hands free to focus on the exercises. In fact, the game encourages you to incorporate your own exercise equipment (weights, balance ball, etc). Just tell it what you have at home, and your coach will add it to your personal workout. No other fitness product provides this level of personalization and interactivity while leaving your hands free.
