Pilates is a system of exercise created in the 1920s by Joseph H. Pilates as a form of physical therapy and strength training designed to elongate your muscles rather than shorten them, leading to a lean build instead of bulking up.  Daisy Fuentes Pilates takes place on a luxurious tropical island resort. The game features 10 different exercises with three different difficulty levels: Beginner, Intermediate and Challenging.  This fitness application features a 3D Avatar of Daisy Fuentes who performs the exercises with the player. The application tracks player performance using the Wii remote and Wii Balance Board.  The application also features a selection of diet and exercise tips along with various extras, such as being able to choose Daisy's outfit style and color from a number of workout outfits.  Daisy Fuentes herself speaks in English and Spanish (depending on your language selection) throughout play.
