Emergency Mayhem puts the player at the helm of the three emergency services in a frantic race against time to hold together Crisis City, a mad metropolis falling apart at the seams.    Combining chaotic driving sequences with arcade mini-games, you ll be in stitches controlling the frenzied police, fire service or paramedics as they dash around the city from one emergency situation to the next. With over 30 missions, it s a non-stop time crisis where you ll be rescuing people from burning buildings, defusing bombs and more.
