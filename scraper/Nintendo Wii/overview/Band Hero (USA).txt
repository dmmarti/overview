Band Hero  is a karaoke/rhythm based game, similar to the Guitar Hero games, but directed at the pop loving teenage crowd, as well as a more group based party game (unlike with guitar hero, full band instruments are included from the beginning of the series).  The instruments are the same as in the more recent GH games. You have the microphone for vocals, guitars for either lead or bass guitar and the drum kits for drumming along. Accordingly, each instrument has its own 'career' path in game.  If you are doing the vocals for your band, you have to sing along in time to the music, matching the pitch as closely as possible. Lead and bass guitar is played by holding down the fret buttons and strumming as the appropriate fret icons cross the strike line on screen. Drums are done similar to the guitars, hitting the correct drum pad's/cymbals at the correct time. The better you do, the more points you score, however if you make too many mistakes, you will fail the song.  You can either play alone on any of the instrument careers, or you can play with up to three friends on one console or online to compete with other players and bands from across the world.  Songs featured include Duran Duran's Rio, Don McLean's American Pie, Evanescence's Bring Me To Life and Queen's Crazy Little Thing Called Love.
