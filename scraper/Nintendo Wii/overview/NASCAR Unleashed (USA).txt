NASCAR Unleashed is an arcade-style racing game that puts superstar drivers on real-world roads, with races run in famous venues such as Daytona, Martinsville, and Chicagoland -- and out in the surrounding city streets, as well. Behind the wheel as Kyle Busch, Dale Earnhardt Jr., Jeff Gordon, or one of a dozen others, players take the power and speed of NASCAR for an off-track joyride. Forgiving physics and accelerated action encourage players to trade paint as they push fearlessly to the front of the pack, while authentic techniques such as drafting or sling-shotting earn an extra boost.
