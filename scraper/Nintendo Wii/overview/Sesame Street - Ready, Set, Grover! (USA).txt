For those who have never Grovered before, it is all about getting up, being active, and living well. Join Grover, Elmo, and Abby Cadabby in a variety of obstacle course-style challenges designed to get players moving. Along the way, players learn healthy habits including good nutrition, proper hygiene, and the importance of regular rest and relaxation. The difficulty level adapts to your child s skill level.
