Rooms: The Main Building is a breakthrough gaming experience that blends brain-teasing adventure elements with a wholly unique world to create a journey unlike any other. Your adventure begins when an invitation abruptly arrives at your doorstep and diverts you to an entrance of a world filled with mystic beauty. Getting there is the easy part, coming home will be the adventure.nnIn this new world, you'll need to reach the exit of each of the 100+ rooms by sliding pieces of the rooms along a 2-D plane, forcing you to use all of your ingenuity to escape. Your character can move from room to room as long as there's a path that isn't blocked by a wall or obstacle. As you continue the adventure, you'll encounter several tools that will introduce new elements. Use teleporters, wardrobes, hydrants, and other objects to navigate your way through.
