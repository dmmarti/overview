Be discovered and whisked away to a secret, tropical island where you learn what it takes to be a star. Customize your character to create a performer who represents your unique style. Build your singing and dancing skills by performing in posh environments fit for a star. Have a blast playing with or against your friends, belting your favorite tunes into the microphone, and performing real dance moves that are captured on screen using the Wii's motion-sensing technology. Once your skills are perfected, perform for the judges in the ultimate competition, the Boogie Star Show.
