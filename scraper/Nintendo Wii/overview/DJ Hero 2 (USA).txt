You can bring a second DJ to the party in this second installment of the groundbreaking music experience. Who gets to play the hero is up to you. Two DJs can spin at once, and a vocalist can join them in DJ Hero 2. Spin 70 new tracks from top artists and create a new mix each time with new Freestyle Sections. Prove you're the king of the club in innovative DJ Battles, become a mogul in Empire Mode, or let the game take over in Party Mode. You can even keep up with and challenge your friends through the Hero Feed, which throws down the gauntlet whether they're on or offline.
