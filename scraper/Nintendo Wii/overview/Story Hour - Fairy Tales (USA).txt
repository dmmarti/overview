Classic fairy tales and fables had been passed down from generation to generation verbally and in books. Those traditions are now getting an interactive twist in the Story Hour series. A modern take on such beloved tales as Cinderella, Snow White, Jack and the Beanstalk, and Paul Bunyan, these tales offer four different stories that incorporate motion sensitive controls so that parents and preschoolers can tell stories together. Story Hour: Fairy Tales features four classic stories: 12 Dancing Princesses (illustrated by Alessia Girasole), Snow White (illustrated by C.B. Canga), Rapunzel (illustrated by Guy Francis) and Cinderella (illustrated by Patricia Castelao.)
