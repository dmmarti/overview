Beastly is a film based on Beauty and the Beast, and the game delivers a fresh take on the movie. You can experience your own version of the Beastly story through the eyes of your own character. Attend Buckston Academy alongside Kyle Kingston, the big man on campus who has it all, only to lose everything when he's cursed with tortured looks. Play 14 mini-games in seven 3D environments straight out of the movie. Connect with characters through the Buckston Academy social network, collect clips and pictures from the movie, and more.
