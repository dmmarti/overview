Positioned as an alternative retelling of the Gundam One Year War mythos, Mobile Suits have been super-deformed and their usual weapons have been taken away. Instead of the regulation issue beam saber and heavy artillery, the SD Gundam wields an almighty hammer in the shape of a spiky iron sphere which is lashed out from a variable-length chain. One-liners and gags also pepper the script for a light-hearted romp into the heart of the Gundam universe.
