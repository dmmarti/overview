Red Steel 2 is a single player first-person shooter that allows the player to blend Samurai bushido ethics with the blade, with the over-the-top gun combat. A Wii exclusive, action is set in a fictional, yet immersive and edgy Western setting and utilizes optional Wii MotionPlus technology to add precision to players actions both with the sword and the gun. This precision of motion allows everything from turning the sword into both a cutting and blunt weapon, to blocking bullets with single strokes as players exact revenge on a rival clan.
