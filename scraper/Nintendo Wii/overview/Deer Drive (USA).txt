Deer Drive brings arcade-style multiplayer hunting action to the Wii. With an intense one-player Challenge Mode, an exciting Party Mode for up to four players, and a new two-player simultaneous Competition Mode, Deer Drive is an intense hunting experience for parties full of people. Target scores of magnificent animals in over 30 stages. Animals can gallop, leap and swerve to dodge your shot, and animals such as wolves and mountain lions can rampage against you if you put them in your sights.
