Celebrate 20 Years of Kirby Fun with a Special Collection for Wii The pink, surprisingly powerful Kirby character is one of the most iconic heroes in video game history. To celebrate two decades of rollicking Kirby action, Nintendo has packed a wealth of games and commemorative content onto one special disc to create Kirby s Dream Collection: Special Edition, available exclusively for the Wii system. From the original Game Boy classic Kirby s Dream Land to New Challenge Stages based on 2011 s Kirby s Return to Dream Land, players can follow the evolution of Kirby s remarkable abilities - and his pesky enemies - through six complete games and then some. The collection also includes a music CD*, an interactive timeline and a special anniversary book, giving both new and experienced players a way to fully immerse themselves in the one-of-a-kind fun of Kirby.
