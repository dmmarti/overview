Based on the critically acclaimed 'Dead Rising' for the Xbox 360, Dead Rising: Chop Till You Drop follows the harrowing tale of Frank West, an overly zealous freelance journalist on a hunt for the scoop of a lifetime. In pursuit of a juicy lead, he makes his way to the small suburban town of Willamette only to find that it has become overrun by zombies. Frank escapes to the local shopping mall where he thinks he will find safety only to discover its crawling with the un-dead!
