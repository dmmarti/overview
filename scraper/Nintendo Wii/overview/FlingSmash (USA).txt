FlingSmash is comparable to Wii Play, in that it is a title published by Nintendo to show off a bundled controller. Where Wii Play included the standard Wii Remote, FlingSmash is intended to show off the revamped Wii Remote Plus. This is essentially the Wii Remote featuring the Wii Motion Plus technology.  The game itself is a combination of pinball and table tennis; the player uses the controller to fling the ball-shaped character - Zip - into horizontally or vertically scrolling screens of blocks and items in order to smash them. Zip changes size and form in various situations, including a heavy steel ball.  The story revolves around this character, who needs to defend Sutton Island from an invader known as Omminus. There are eight regular stages to move through, each hiding five medallions for the player to find. Environments include the tops of tropical trees, grottoes under the sea, and beaches. Besides these regular stages, there are also eight extra stages and eight bonus mini-games.
