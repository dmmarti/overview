Boom Blox is a action puzzle game developed in conjunction with Steven Spielberg. The objective of Boom Blox is to keep a structure made of blocks from being knocked down or to knock over a structure using the Wii Remote to throw, shoot or grab colorful character-based blocks through 300 levels through five worlds.    The game utilizes a realistic physics-based system. Depending on how a projectile is thrown and at what angle, the blocks will react accordingly, and collapse based on the real-time action.
