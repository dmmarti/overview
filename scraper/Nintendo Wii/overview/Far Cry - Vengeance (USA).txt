The game takes full advantage of the Wii Remote and its Nunchuk attachment. For example, the player can make the character jump by lifting the nunchuk. Weapons are aimed by pointing the Wii Remote at the screen, and melee attacks are carried out by making a slashing motion with it. The zoom on sniper rifles will similarly be controlled by moving the Wii Remote towards the television. Split screen Chaos mode (standard deathmatch) is included.
