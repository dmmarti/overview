When mankind evolves into raging mutant beasts, one teenager gets lucky and morphs into...Earth's most advanced weapon! Play as Rex and join Providence, the organization dedicated to stop the mutants in this game based on the Cartoon Network series. Particles called nanites have infected nearly everyone on Earth, turning them into beasts called E.V.O.s. Rex can not only control his E.V.O. mutation, he can use it to take on different forms and drain nanites from other mutants, curing their infection. Use your one-of-a-kind abilities to battle mutants across the globe, building bigger weapons to defeat an enemy that's evolving into something more powerful with each passing day.
