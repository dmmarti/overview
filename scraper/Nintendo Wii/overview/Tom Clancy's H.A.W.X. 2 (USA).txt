Everything in HAWX 2 pushes the envelope: the aircraft you pilot, the weapons you deploy, even the technology used to make the images in the game itself. Join the most elite team of pilots in the world and fly missions that never happened using 50 of the world's most advanced aircraft. Pilot drones on recon missions, engage in fierce dogfights, and make crippling bombing runs. The futuristic Enhanced Reality System returns to help you target enemies, avoid threats, and harness the full power of your aircraft. And the ground below has once again been created with images from GeoEye, one of the most advanced satellites in orbit!
