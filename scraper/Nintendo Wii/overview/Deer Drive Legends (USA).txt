The world's wildest animals are in your crosshairs in this hunting trek where you'll track Earth's most elusive beasts! Legendary beasts are pursued, hunting legends are made, and legendary trophies are brought home in Deer Drive Legends. Choose the weapon to suit your target from an arsenal of shotguns, crossbows, snipers, and more. Your hunting skills will be pushed to the limit in remote environments where your prey clearly has the home field advantage. Hunt over 30 kinds of animals, including Irish elk, white-tailed deer, woolly rhinos, and wolves. Once you've bagged one of those beasts, the challenge really heats up with huge boss battles against legendary creatures like saber-toothed cats and the mighty T-Rex!
