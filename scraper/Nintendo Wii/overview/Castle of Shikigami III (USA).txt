A continuation of the Shikigami series, CoS III is a standard vertical-scrolling sci-fi shooter, featuring ten different characters each with their own special weapons and abilities.  There are five different stages to play in, each of them divided into two chapters and has the standard huge, wild-looking bosses to destroy. The player also has the option to switch between aircraft in mid-flight in one-player games or you can play with a friend in co-op.  There are fifty-five possible story elements and a Tension Bonus system that rewards the player by putting themselves in danger by getting close to enemies and dodging enemy fire and it also has a gallery mode.
