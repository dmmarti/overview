Escape The Museum is a hidden object game with some elements of the adventure genre. Besides the usual gameplay mechanic of finding objects from a list by clicking on them, the game has adventure portions where the player must collect and use objects to escape from a room. These sections follow the simplified puzzle patterns of the recent Azada and Dream Chronicles games.  After each chapter, the player has to search the previous adventure levels for 10 instances of a certain object. 12 precious artifacts have to be collected throughout the game. The game keeps a score based on accuracy, time, object value and the use of hints.  There are some mini-games: paintings work like jigsaw puzzles that have to be reassembled, and scales have to be stabilized by shifting weights until they reach equilibrium.
