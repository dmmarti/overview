Mysterious and tiny creatures, the Eledees have been the source of the world?s power for the past 10,000 years. In the game world, there are no such things as gas, coal, or nuclear power. Instead, there are many different breeds of Eledees, each with their own unique look and personality. While humans and Eledees have always lived in harmony, these friendly beings love to cause trouble, and it?s up to players to track them down and put an end to their mischief.Embracing the unique functionality of the Wii and Nunchuk controllers, the game will allow players to interact with their environment in all-new ways as they search for the power-generating creatures. Using the futuristic devices, players can push, pull, lift and throw anything they come across to discover secret hiding places and obstruct escape paths for the Eledees. Each location gets progressively illuminated as the errant Eledees are collected, with lights gradually coming on and power restored as more and more are found.The Wii game also enjoys a very open play system which encourages players to devise their own strategy to round up the stray power sources, using stealth to sneak up on them or creating noise to scare them out of concealed areas. As players capture Eledees and harness their power-generating abilities, numerous options and additional opportunities unfold to find even more Eledees in the ever-changing environment.A new Edit Mode allows users to create levels which can be passed on to friends via WiiConnect24. There is also a Multi-Player mode that allows up to four players to compete simultaneously and created stages can also be shared within this. Finally, an Album Mode allows users to take pictures during the game, which can then be sent to friends via Nintendo?s Wii Connect service.
