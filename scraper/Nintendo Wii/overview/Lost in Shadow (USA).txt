Lost in Shadow is a puzzle platforming video game developed for Nintendo s Wii console by Hudson Soft. It was released in Japan in July 2010, in Australia and Europe (known as  A Shadow s Tale ) in October 2010, and in North America in January 2011. Lost in Shadow is played largely in the background of the game environment as the player controls a boy s shadow, which must climb the shadows of a tall tower, rife with puzzles and enemies. He is accompanied by a sylph that can alter the direction of the foreground light sources, altering the alignment of shadows upon which he climbs. There are times in the game when the boy is able to materialize into the 3D world and briefly interact with the objects themselves as opposed to simply their shadows.
