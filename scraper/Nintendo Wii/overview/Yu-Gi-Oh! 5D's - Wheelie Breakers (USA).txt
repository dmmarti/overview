A new era has dawned and Yu-Gi-Oh! returns with a fast paced twist on card dueling. Hot new duelists in Neo Domino City have taken card battling to the streets in a new motorsport called â€œWheelie Breakersâ€  that combines traditional card dueling with motorcycle racing. Climb upon your duel runner, summon magic monsters from your deck and battle opponents as you tear through race courses and city streets. Monsters use completely unique attack powers created just for the game to try and destroy other racers and keep them from completing the race. Battle your arch enemies for track supremacy in the first ever, card dueling wheel and deal.
