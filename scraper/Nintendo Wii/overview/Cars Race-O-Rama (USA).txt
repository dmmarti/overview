In Cars Race-O-Rama, players will join Lightning McQueen and Chick Hicks in Radiator Springs as they prepare their academy of student racers to compete in the Race-O-Rama Exhibition. Players will encounter 12 new playable characters making their video game debut. A new and improved Lightning McQueen will come fully equipped with special racing kits, allowing him to better maneuver brand new, action-packed tracks that will take players to metro city streets, the Baja desert and sandy beaches. In addition, players are now able to modify Lightning McQueen's wheels, rims, hood, side skirt, rear bumper, spoiler and paint with special customization features, giving Lightning a personalized style and look that has never been seen before. As players compete in this high-speed, racing adventure game, they will be able to utilize Lightning McQueen's newly designed drifting abilities and perform "Kachow" poses for enthusiastic reporters and fans encountered throughout the game. Cars Race-O-Rama will also feature multiplayer mini-games based on Disney/Pixar's "Cars Toons," a series of animated shorts from the Disney Channel.
