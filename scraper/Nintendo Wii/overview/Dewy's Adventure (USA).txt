The evil Don Hedron has descended upon the peaceful forest with Black Water and it's up to Dewy, a small droplet of water, to eliminate the terrible scourge and save the Tree of Seven Colors. Take control of Dewy using the Wii Remote, rolling him around the environment and using special elemental powers with unique gesture-based controls to take on the dastardly forces of Don Hedron. Control heat and cold to transform Dewy into ice and steam to solve puzzles and restore a beautiful world of peace!
