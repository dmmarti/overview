PDC World Championship Darts 2009 is the 2009 iteration in the series.   Like previous versions it has an official license and includes 18 official top pro players and events from all over the world. The character creator has been improved, new events are available and it is now also possible to play as a female player. The controls have been completely revamped from the previous Wii version.
