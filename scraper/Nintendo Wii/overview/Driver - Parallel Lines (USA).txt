For the first time ever, experience the Driver franchise that?s sold over 14 million copies on Nintendo Wii with Driver Parallel Lines. You were the fastest wheelman on the street. You were a legend. You were money. Until they set you up and sent you down. Twenty-eight years inside for someone else?s crime. Now you?re getting out. Guess what? You got a new job, it?s called getting revenge.
