Gamers play and develop their own comic-book mutant heroes and villains in X-Men: Destiny. Set in the Marvel universe and featuring familiar friends and foes from Professor Xavier s School for Gifted Youngsters, the game focuses on three original characters -- teenagers whose mutant superpowers are just beginning to manifest. Each playable character has a basic mutant special ability, which players gradually custom-enhance as they earn upgrades throughout the adventure.
