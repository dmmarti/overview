Experts in meditation have created an innovative game concept inspired by the ancient system of chakras - the body's seven energy centers through which the life force flows - and challenges players to achieve a peaceful and focused "flow state." As they make their way through a visually stunning environment, players practice playful yoga-inspired activities, breathing exercises and meditation. Their journey is set to mood-enhancing music and infused with Deepak?s teachings and philosophies.
