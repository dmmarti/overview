In PopStar Guitar, players assume the role of a lead guitarist on a musical journey, beginning in a garage band and eventually progressing to the main stage of a worldwide "Battle of the Bands" competition. The Wii version of PopStar Guitar will feature the AirG, an exciting new peripheral that snaps onto the Wii Remote and transforms the controller into an air guitar.
