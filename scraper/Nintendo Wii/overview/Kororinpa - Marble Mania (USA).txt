In Kororinpa: Marble Mania the player uses the Wiimote to roll balls through mazes by tilting it to change the angle of the maze on screen; tilt it too much, and the ball will fall off the track. Along the way there are crystals to collect and a certain number of them is needed to unlock the final door in each level in order to progress to the next. Some even unlock  secret  levels. Each level can be replayed infinitely to improve the time.    The "balls" are not really balls but cute creatures, such as a ladybug, a fluffy cat, and a watermelon. They have different characteristics e.g response time, speed, and bounciness. The mazes get increasingly complex and can require the player to turn the controller upside down. There are 50 levels in five different environments, each with specific a visual style, music, and obstacles.
