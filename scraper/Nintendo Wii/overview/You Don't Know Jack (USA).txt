YOU DON'T KNOW JACK, the original quiz show party game, is back and trivia-y-er than ever! You're the contestant in a truly interactive game show experience, complete with cash, prizes, backstage characters, pounding music, bizarre sound effects and your lovable yet verbally sassy host, Cookie Masterson. Play at home or online - alone or with friends - as you battle through a trivia mind-field on your way to victory, defeat or, more likely, soiled pants.    We've re-imagined a new and improved YOU DON'T KNOW JACK for the 21st century. All of your favorite elements are still there: the twisted multiple-choice questions, musical question intros, the DisOrDat?, Screw Your Neighbor? and the Jack Attack?, plus all kinds of new face-melting features and surprises - including online play! And of course, tons of all-new twisted trivia questions covering everything from Dr. Phil to Dr. Pepper, from Miley Cyrus to the Mile High Club. It's fun, it's funny, it's funky, and it kills more than 99.9% of known fungi. YOU DON'T KNOW JACK!
