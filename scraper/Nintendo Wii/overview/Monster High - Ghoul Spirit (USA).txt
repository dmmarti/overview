Be the coolest ghoul in school as you enroll at Monster High! Everything about it is just like a regular high school, except for the students. Creep-tastic creatures inspired by the spookiest movie monsters roam these halls. They're not out for blood or brains...they just want to get their homework done, hang with their friends, and score a date for the dance. Create a custom ghoul with your choice of drop-dead-gorgeous outfits and hair, then hit the books to be an ogre-achiever. Show off your style, build your rep, and see if you have enough creepy-cred to be voted Scream Queen at the Terror Under the Sea Dance.
