Bwaah... Been there. Done that. Invaded Earth. Partied hardy? Now, it's time for an ADVENTURE... The Rabbids' first comedy-adventure will take them to the moon or bust! As usual, they have an infallible plan: collect all the human Stuff they can find, heap it onto a giant Pile and climb to the moon? Not so fast! The Humans revolt and become Verminators to exterminate the Rabbid varmints and defend their precious Stuff: ?Rabbids Go Home!'
