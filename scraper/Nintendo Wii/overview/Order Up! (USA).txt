In Order Up!, the player follows a promising new chef from his (or her!) days flipping burgers at the fast food restaurant "Burger Face", through to becoming the newest celebrity chef on the island of Port Abellow as he takes part in the prestigious "Fortified Chef" competition. Master cuisines from classic American diner food, to Italian, Mexican and Italian as you build your restaurant empire. Become a true executive chef as you add new dishes to the menu, buy new spices, upgrade your kitchen, hire and fire sous chefs and, most importantly, create and serve amazing food.  The cooking is performed through mini games where players use the Wii Remote to interact with the food, while the serving part is more like time management games like Diner Dash.
