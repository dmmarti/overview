Major League Baseball's only cross-console video game series returns to the field with a 2010 release for Wii. Once again, a system-exclusive, motion-sensitive control system simulates the real-life actions of pitching the ball and swinging the bat. Built on the same engine as the previous year's game, the 2K10 edition of the MLB game boasts improvements in accuracy and offers new features to give players more control while pitching and hitting. The "Total Hitting Control" system allows players on offence to swing for the fences, aim for a well-placed fair ball, or foul out of play, to work against the pitcher's stamina in a full-count battle. The "Batter's Eye" feature occasionally gives players a momentary preview of a pitch will cross the plate, depending in part on the skill and accuracy of the athlete at bat.
