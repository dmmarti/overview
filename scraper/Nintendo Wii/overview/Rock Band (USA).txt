Harmonix, developers of the blockbuster Guitar Hero and Rock Band franchises, are delivering AC/DC LIVE, a continuation of the Rock Band platform that lets audiences of all ages interact with music in an all-new way - collaboratively, competitively, or in single-player to experience the majestic power of AC/DC. - Play your favorite hard-rockin' classics, or jump right in and conquer the entire 18-song set! All of your favorite modes return - solo and band tours, tug-of-war, score duel, and even practice mode. - Rock Band's trademark guitar, bass, drums, and vocals put you right onstage where the action is! You can use your Rock Band or Rock Band 2 peripherals to create the ultimate music game experience - you can tap out guitar solos with the 2nd set of frets at the top of your guitar neck, freeform drum fill your way through drumming sections, or use freestyle vocals to express yourself while belting out AC/DC classics
