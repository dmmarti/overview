Sased on the popular exercise DVD series, 10 Minute Solution will bring focused exercise activities to fitness fans with busy schedules, in an affordable and fun way. 10 Minute Solution combines the ease of the popular fitness DVDs with casual gaming fun. The game allows players to construct regimens from a wide variety of 10 minute routine blocks, organized into three main categories: cardio boxing, mixed games and aerobics. 10 Minute Solution is designed to captivate fitness enthusiasts and gamers alike with intense routines that play as a game, unlike other fitness games that simply have the player following a trainer on screen. The game is enhanced when played with the Wii Balance Board, but still offers a fantastic workout without it.
