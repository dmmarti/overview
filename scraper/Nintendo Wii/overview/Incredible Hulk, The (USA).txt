The story mode follows Hulk and Rick Jones on their quest to stop an evil organization called the Enclave, the Army, and to rid Banner of his alter ego, the Hulk.   Standard control configuration uses the left analog stick to move Hulk, the right analog stick to pan the camera 360 degrees around, and the face buttons to perform punches, jumps, and grabs. The game features hundreds of collectible items, some of which unlock bonus art, unlockable special characters, and numerous mini-games.
