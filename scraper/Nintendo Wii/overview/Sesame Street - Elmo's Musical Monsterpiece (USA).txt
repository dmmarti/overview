Sesame Street: Elmo's Musical Monsterpiece is a new game for the Nintendo Wii and DS that kids will be able to rock out with their favorite Sesame Street characters, engaging in activities that promote musical creativity and dancing. The game also manages to throw in a few activities designed to foster development of math skills through connections between math and music. The in-game music comes from eclectic Los Angeles band Ozomatli, who use a wide range of styles in their music - ideal for kids who need a lot of variety. Ozomatli is also no stranger to lending their work to the video game world, with songs featured in many prominent sports games, so their work should feel natural on these new Nintendo Wii and DS games. The game is simple enough for toddlers to play without too much help, but there is plenty of room for parents to get involved and get in some playtime with their kids.
