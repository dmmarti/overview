In All Star Cheer Squad 2, 14 exotic locations from around the world will serve as the backdrop for global cheer competitions. No longer a newbie, players will start out as the captain of the Tiger Squad, leading the team to victory by utilizing an all-new diverse move set that includes realworld aerial stunts, tumbling, formation changes and advanced moves on the Wii Balance Board accessory. Moves can be executed by using two Wii Remotes, allowing for greater mobility. Players will select their squad members and then choose from more customization options including new makeup, hairstyle and uniforms. Because every routine need good beat first, All Star Cheer Squad 2 will feature even more original cheer music. Combined with an upgraded routine editor featuring a music mixer, a choreography editor and the ability to challenge friends via WiiConnect24, All Star Cheer Squad 2 will allow players to live the ultimate cheer experience.
