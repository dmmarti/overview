Tony Stark had it all: a genius mind, fame, and even a multinational corporation. But his life would soon change forever. During a routine weapons test in the Middle East, power-hungry militants led a violent ambush against Tony and claimed him as their prisoner. Armed with Stark Industries weaponry, Tony?s new foes demanded he construct a new ultimate weapon for them. Instead, with the help of fellow captive Yinsen, Tony built his own ultimate weapon ? a powerful suit of armor that served as the key to his heroic escape.After returning home, Tony?s near-death experience drastically altered his outlook on life. The attack against Tony ? with his own creations, no less ? inspired him to cease production of all Stark Industries weapons, despite the protests of longtime familyfriend and mentor Obadiah Stane. And that wasn?t all. Aided by his charming assistant, Pepper Potts, and equipped with a new suit even more advanced than the one used in his escape, Tony took it upon himself to destroy all Stark weapons in enemy hands ? personally. He became more than a man. He became Iron Man.Customize your suit and battle against armies of fighter jets, tanks, armored Super Villains and more. Blast into hardcore shooting action and explosive combat from the film as well as exclusive content created just for the game.
