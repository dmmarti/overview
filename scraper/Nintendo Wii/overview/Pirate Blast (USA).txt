You arrive at Vile Isle amusement park, the world's first amusement park to feature robotic pirates and monkeys. But the park robots have gone silly at the hands of their robotic leader, Captain Greasebeard, who thinks he's a real pirate. Your mission is to stop Captain Greasebeard and his evil Henchbots, save all the friendly robots, and return the amusement park to normal in time for the park's grand opening. Time to get swashbuckling!
