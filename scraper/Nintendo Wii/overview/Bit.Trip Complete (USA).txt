Retro-classic meets modern-cool in this collection of games built on a creative combination of 8-bit graphics and addictive, quick-hit, arcade-style play that dares you to escape its gravitational pull. Bit.Trip Complete brings together six Bit.Trip games: Bit.Trip Beat, Core, Void, Runner, Fate, and Flux. Together, they tell the epic story of CommaderVideo. Beat, Core, and Void are all rhythm-based challenges. Runner moves to 2600-style platforming, Fate turns on the shooter explosiveness, while Flux returns to Bit.Trip's rhythm roots. Each game features a classic chiptune soundtrack and one-of-a-kind visuals that look like they leaked out of an Atari that spent the last 30 years cooking in the microwave.Features:- 6 Complete Games- Online Leaderboards- 120 New Gameplay Challenges- New Difficulty Modes- Unlockable Audio, Video, and Art Galleries
