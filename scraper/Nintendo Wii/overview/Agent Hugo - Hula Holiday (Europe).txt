Agent Hugo: Hula Holiday is a 3D platform game staring Hugo the TV troll that is played from a behind view perspective. While on vacation Agent Hugo notices that a big fly with his robotic trash cans is transforming a nearby island into a dump, in order to feed his fly army.    Gameplay includes platforming and defeating trash cans. Killing enemies can be done with a tail sweep. A tail sweep can also be used to activate screw switches for doors. Sometimes a bubble gun can be used to shoot at distant enemies, trapping them helplessly inside floating soap-bubbles, until they can be eliminated with a tail-sweep at close range.
