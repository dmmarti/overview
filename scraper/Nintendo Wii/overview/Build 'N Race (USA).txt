Racing fans with a knack for design can enjoy the best of both worlds as they create original racetracks and then speed around them with as many as three friends in Build'n Race. There are a number of included courses from which to choose, each filled with jumps, ramps, and hairpin turns designed to encourage fast-paced, stunt-filled races, and players can tackle any of the tracks in "Solo Race," "Time Trial," "Championship," "Race Challenge," and "Time Challenge" modes. The design function lets gamers place hundreds of different track pieces, buildings, and environmental objects, and then join up to three players for split-screen multiplayer races.
