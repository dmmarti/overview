The all-ages dance party continues with Just Dance Kids! Kids can get movin' and keep groovin' with 40 all-new dance routines created for kids and led by kids. The soundtrack blends top hits with timeless classics, songs from favorite TV shows, and even nursery rhymes for li'l dancers. Tracks include "Whip My Hair," "Gummy Bear," "The Lion Sleeps Tonight," tunes from The Wiggles and Yo Gabba Gabba, and more. Kids can make their own setlists, parents can create a timed non-stop shuffle, and four players can dance together. A Wii-exclusive Balloon Mode adds a twist, challenging kids to shake their remotes and pop balloons as they move to the music.
