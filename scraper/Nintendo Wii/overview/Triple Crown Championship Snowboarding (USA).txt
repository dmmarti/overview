The game features three of the national snowboarding team s biggest female athletes in their natural element, strapped onto snowboards that are rocketing down mountains or pulling off physics-bending tricks in the halfpipe.  Triple Crown Championship Snowboarding puts these amazing women front and center, sharing the spotlight with the top two male snowboard cross riders Nate Holland and Seth Westcott in Snowboard Cross, Halfpipe, and Slopestyle events. With a nail-biting sensation of speed, players can choose to master the mountain and ride with the best using traditional Wii controls or use the Balance Board for an extra layer of riding simulation.
