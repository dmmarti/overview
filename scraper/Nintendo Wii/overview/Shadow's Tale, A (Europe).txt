A Shadow?s Tale is enchanting to look at. The trailer alone is enough to send you weak at the knees. Originally known as Lost in Shadow, it?s out in Europe months before America, giving us a rare chance to gloat. The game plays with perspective, light and darkness in strikingly inventiveand innovatively beautiful ways, casting you as a shadow boy severed from your living body. Thrown from the top of a sky-piercing spire down to the very bottom, you must make your way back to your body by climbing up to the top, only able to move in the immaterial world.
