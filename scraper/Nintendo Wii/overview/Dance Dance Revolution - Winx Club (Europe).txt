Dance Dance Revolution Winx Club is a music video game that was released by Konami in the first quarter 2009 in European countries for the Wii and uses the same engine used by Dance Dance Revolution Hottest Party 2. The game focuses on the Winx Club series, featuring songs and characters from the show as well as Japanese songs unrelated to the series.    DDR Winx Club is also be one of the first DDR games released in Europe to use the Dance Dance Revolution name rather than Dancing Stage as was done in the past, a change that was indicated in the original announcement for a European arcade release of Dance Dance Revolution X.
