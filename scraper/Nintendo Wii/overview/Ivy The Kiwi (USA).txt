The objective in the game is to lead the character, Ivy, a newly born bird, to her lost mother.  In the game, Ivy is constantly moving directly right or left, unless presented with something in her way, in which case she turns around and moves the other direction. The player takes advantage of this by drawing lines to guide the chick away from danger and to the goal. The player can make ramp lines to have Kiwi walk up or down, make vertical lines to reverse Kiwi s direction, or pull the vines and slingshot kiwi in a given direction.
