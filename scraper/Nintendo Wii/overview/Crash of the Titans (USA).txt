Crash s enemies are now his weapons!        "Jack to Attack!" . Control, play and battle as 15 outrageous, original enemies, including titanic creatures such as Scorporilla, Ratcicle, Magamadon and Shellephant. While in control of a monster players can throw toxic stink bombs, call lightning down from the sky, fire lasers beams from their eyes or even impale enemies with a massive scorpion tail - use all of the creatures  special abilities to defeat Neo and Nina Cortex.      Hyper-Dynamic Combat . For the first time ever, Crash now has a powerful acrobatic fighting system that includes punches and flying kicks, multiple attacks and special counter moves. Players can power-up skills to unlock new attacks and blazing combos.      Exploration and Adventure . With an amazingly expanded move set, Crash can now interact with his world in totally new ways. Players will be able to wall-run, swing from ropes and flip off springboards . Crash can even toss Aku Aku on the ground to surf, skate, grind and shred.      Wacky Co-Op Action . At any point in the game, a second player can join in the fun and play as Carbon-Crash to help unleash total chaos! In a totally innovative twist to co-op action gaming, Crash can even jack Carbon-Crash (or vice versa) for some hysterical Crash "jacked"-Crash mayhem.    In CrashÂ® of the Titans, players will fight a nefarious plot hatched by Crash s arch nemeses Neo and Nina Cortex to mutate the local creatures into titanic abominations. Using Crash s legendary mix of outrageous antics and daredevil bravado, players will "hijack" enemies to take control of their action and use their fearsome powers against all manner of enemies.
