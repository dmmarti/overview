Barnyard is an offering from THQ based on the movie of the same name from Nickelodeon.    You arrive at the farm as a newbie cow, and must complete quests and earn respect in order to win keys that allow you to advance through the barnyard map. As you play, you need to keep up your stamina, which decreases as you run around the farm. A good sleep is important; you need to be rested to fight off marauding raccoons and coyotes. And do remember not to let the Farmer catch you standing on two feet!
