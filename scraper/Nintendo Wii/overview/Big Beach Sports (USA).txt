A light hearted party game in the vain of Wii Sports. Up to four players can partake in six different games featuring Beach Volleyball, Bocce, Soccer, Disc Golf, Football, and Cricket.   Players can either play with friends in quick matches or enter single player tournaments in order to win trophies. Performing various tasks, such as getting a certain number of goals in soccer or getting a hole in one in Disc golf, would reward the player with both achievements and skill points that would subtly raise the difficulty for each individual sport.
