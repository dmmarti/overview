Thor on Wii gets a lot of things right. The core combat mechanic works well, even if many of your move options don t seem necessary. It s easy to get big chain attacks going, resulting in some flashy moves and a feeling that you truly are kicking some ass. Despite that, Thor is a mixed affair. Level design is unimaginably dull, and boss encounters are too far apart to be rewarding. Visually the game struggles, as well, with a streamlined graphical approach failing to hold off a staggeringly inconsistent framerate and other awkward glitches. That s really a shame.
