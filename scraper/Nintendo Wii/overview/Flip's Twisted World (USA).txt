A unique gameplay mechanic is at the center of Flip's Twisted World for Wii. This puzzle platform game puts the world literally in the palm of your hand as you navigate topsy-turvy landscapes where up and down, and left and right are only a matter of perspective. Players will help the curious magician's apprentice Flip rotate the environment 90 degrees at will to solve puzzles and ultimately help Flip escape his cube prison.
