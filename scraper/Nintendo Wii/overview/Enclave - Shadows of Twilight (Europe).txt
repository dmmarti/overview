Enclave is a third-person 3D action game from Starbreeze Studios    In this game, set in a medieval fantasy realm, players can choose to take on the role of either a "Warrior of Light" or a "Minion of Darkness", complete with separate and unique missions reflecting the nature of that decision.    1,000 years ago, the Dreg Atar armies of the demon lord known as Vatar had all but destroyed the people of Celenheim. In an act of desperation, the high wizard Zale sundered the land and created a rift around Celenheim, keeping the armies of Vatar at bay. In time, Celenheim forgot the war and forgot Vatar as they went about their daily affairs. Now, the rift is closing, and evil threatens the land once again. An unlikely hero, freed from prison by happenstance, must rise and fight for Light or Darkness, to either destroy the demon king Vatar or kill the queen of Celenheim.    The end seemed inescapable... Vatar - the Prince of Darkness had won. But a lonely Mage stands high up on a mountain ridge, defying the Demon. He lifts his staff high in the air then thumps it down on the earth . and unimaginably powerful spells are created, harnessing the infernal powers of nature. The rift caused by the Mage s powerful spell continues to expand, sucking everything into a seemingly endless abyss.    On the one side an Enclave of Light was created, which they called Celenheim. On the other side of the gigantic ravine, dark and evil life forms were fighting to survive in the Outlands.However, the centuries passed and now the ravine has become narrower. Attacks from the shadow world have grown in number and intensity. In these difficult times, vital decisions must be made, and it s all up to the player!
