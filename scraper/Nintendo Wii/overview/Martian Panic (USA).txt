Martian Panic takes the Wii shooting genre out of this world, with new levels of strategy and experimental weaponry. If one gun at a time isn t enough, players can grab a second Wii Remote and blast away in the game s dual-wielding mode. Up to four players can battle simultaneously against the Martian onslaught and the advanced camera system ensures that the gamer s vantage is always right. The rules are simple but the action is intense, so hold onto your helmet as the challenges escalate.
