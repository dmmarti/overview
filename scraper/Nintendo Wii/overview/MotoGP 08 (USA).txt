MotoGP puts the player at the centre of the MotoGP experience by letting them join a team and compete alongside their sporting heroes in all three race classes 125cc, 250cc and MotoGP. Good results in qualifying and racing earn points that can then be exchanged for bike upgrades to improve attributes such as straight line speed, braking and cornering.
