Experience freedom to move, freedom to create, and freedom to play the beautiful game as it is meant to be played in Pro Evolution Soccer 2011. Anticipate runs by your teammates and pass the ball into space - any space - with enhanced 360-degree passing. New Shot Stamina meters monitor exactly how much power players have left, letting you gauge the chances of an accurate pass before you let it fly. Defenders no longer automatically chase nearby balls, instead reacting to the movements of the player in control. Add improved physics, new tackling styles, and 100 hours of motion-capture movements, and the beautiful game has never looked more realistic.
