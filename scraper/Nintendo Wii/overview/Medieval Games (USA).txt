When in doubt, get ready to go medieval! Choose from eight different characters, including knights, wizards, princesses, bards, jesters, and goons. Play in 30 unique mini-games, each with a Medieval theme and its own flavor. You'll have to knock the other man off his horse in Jousting. Play as a pig and race through a sloppy pen, trying to avoid capture by your owner. You'll compete in archery competitions and prove your capabilities with a catapult. And show your martial skills when you battle dragons and storm castles. Unlock secret items as you play through each event. And join with friends to have an uproarious time while back in time!
