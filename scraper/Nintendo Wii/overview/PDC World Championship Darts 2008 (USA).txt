PDC World Championship Darts 2008 is an officially licensed darts game and sequel to its earlier incarnation. The player can opt to play as existing champions or create his own player. This new version includes even more stars to choose from.  It also includes more licensed events to participate in. Each is modeled after the actual real life events. The game includes three existing darts arenas. An additional game mode is the party mode, a multi-player mode that consists of fifteen different party games. These can only be played on the same machine however and not on-line or via LAN.
