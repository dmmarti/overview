Favre is a playable character in every version of Madden NFL 09. On the Wii,  he is not on the Jets roster, but is available on a historic team, the 2007 Packers. Players can transfer Favre to the free agent roster pool, and pick him up on any of the 32 NFL teams for the 2008 season. A roster update on August 12, 2008 places Favre on the New York Jets roster as their starting quarterback.  Like all other games of EA Sports' 09 Season, the "All Play" version of Madden seen on the Wii features a different photograph of Favre with different graphics and artwork than the other versions of the game.
