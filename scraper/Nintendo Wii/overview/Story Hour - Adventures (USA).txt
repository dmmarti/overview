Story Hour is a collection of â€œinteractive storybooksâ€  . classic public domain children s stories retold and recreated on the Nintendo Wii. In the same way a parent will sit with their child and read any number of classic fairy tale books, members of a family can sit in front of their television and read traditional fantasy tales with their child in an updated interactive format. At once a simple, casual game and a parent-led storytelling experience, Story Hour Adventure is beautiful, educational and fun for parents and children alike.
