Cooking Mama is the follow-on game after the Nintendo DS Cooking Mama game. This time mama teaches you to cook up some delicious international dishes from 10 different countries. After you've mastered your skills you'll want to see how you fair against some of the other chefs out there. With multiplayer you can cook against a friend to see who really is the grill master.    With the unique controls of the Wiimote, you use it to actually move utensils to "cook."
