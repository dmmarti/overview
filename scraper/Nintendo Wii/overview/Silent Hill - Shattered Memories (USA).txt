Shattered Memories marks Silent Hill's debut on the Nintendo Wii where the fear is more real than ever before. Players will be drawn into the mysterious town using the Wii Remote as a flashlight and a cell phone as they search for clues. Shattered Memories promises to be more terrifying than ever. The choices the players make will shape Harry Mason, as well as the people he meets and the places he visits. The enemies evolve as well, taking the form of the player's deepest fears.
