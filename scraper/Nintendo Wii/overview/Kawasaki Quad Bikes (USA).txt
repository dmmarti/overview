It's going to be a messy ride when you jump aboard one of four Kawasaki Quad Bikes and take to the bumpy, muddy and twisty-turny tracks to race against a bevy of opponents in this officially licensed game. With further characters to unlock and mirrored and weathered variations of nine tracks, there will be plenty of kicking dirt. As usual there are the typical race modes including tournaments, time trials, and single races. In contrast to the two other Kawasaki racing games released by Metro3D, Kawasaki Quad Bikes is without a stunt racing game. There is also no multi-player mode for the PC version of the game while the Playstation 2 version sports a 2 player multi-player. The levels offer three different settings which are a stadium, rocky canyons, and a waterfalls/train tracks one.
