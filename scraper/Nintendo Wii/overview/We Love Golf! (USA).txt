We Love Golf! is a mix of arcade/mini-golf and a bit of real golf strategy.  The game utilizes the Wii-remote for hitting and putting the ball, including lining up shots and even adding touch fades and draws with a flick of the players wrist on the remote. The look of the game has an arcade feel, with shots being portrayed with fire trails or comet trails, but the player also has to correct for wind as well as other factors. Each courses has a different look and feel to it, each with their own set of challenging obstacles.  There is a career mode, where players can not only play as characters designed for the game, but also play classic Capcom characters such as Chun-Li and Jill Valentine.  There is also a 4-player party mode and a "World Party" mode, where players can go online with the Mii's and challenge other players and winning medals for their troubles.  Players can also unlock bonus courses and characters by winning various game modes.
