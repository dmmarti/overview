Fullmetal Alchemist: Prince of Dawn promises an original story that connects directly with the original manga. Players take control of main characters Edward and Alphonse and move about Central City, speaking to people and attempting to unravel the mysteries of a certain incident. Unique in gameplay in its Wii incarnation, the gameplay plays out in a traditional adventure sense focusing on interactions with people as you move your character around on a map of Central City.
