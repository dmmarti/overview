Someone is scheduled for extinction - better hope it is not you! Hunt while being hunted in this prehistoric shooter. Take aim at some of the most ferocious beasts to ever stalk the earth. Try to bring down Pterodactyls, Raptors, Akylosauruses, Dilophosauruses, and the mighty T-Rex. Head into battle with your choice of weapon: a shotgun, machine gun, or crossbow. Confident marksmen can hunt with one weapon, while those looking to load up on firepower can hunt with two. And, since everything you're hunting is also hunting you, two just might be the better option!
