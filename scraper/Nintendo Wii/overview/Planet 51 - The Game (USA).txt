Planet 51, the white picket-fence world reminiscent of 1950s America is happy, safe and predictable?until the unpredictable happens!    Out of the blue, Captain Charles ?Chuck' Baker's spaceship comes thundering down. Unaware of his surroundings, Chuck begins to realise that he is not alone. Taking refuge while planning his return home, Chuck meets green-skinned local, Lem, and realises that he may be the real ?alien' after all!
