Clash of Ninja Revolution covers the events of the Chunin Exams arc to the end of the Search for Tsunade arc. Clash of Ninja Revolution uses the same gameplay engine as Gekit√Ö  Ninja Taisen! EX. The game utilizes the Nunchuk accessory for the Wii Remote, for basic attacks and for special attacks that require specific movements from both items. The Classic controller and GameCube controller are also compatible with the game.
