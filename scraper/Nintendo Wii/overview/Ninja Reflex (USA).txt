Ninja Reflex is a game to test the players reaction speed and timing.  The mini-games consist of catching flies with chopsticks, catching Koi fish from a pond along with training with martial arts weapons of the shuriken, samurai sword and nunchaku.  Completing these tasks will earn the player a digital belt from their own personal sensai.    There is also a meditation method where the game will guide the player to calm their breathing and relaxing their muscles.  It can support up to four-players on a multi-player mode, letting players challenge each other to see who has faster reaction times.
