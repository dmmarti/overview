Samurai Warriors 3 offers two-player online and offline co-op with enhanced sharing features. The game also uses a special new game mode that offers players unique control of characters never seen before. This game mode is based on the Famicom game Nazo no Murasamejo (The Mysterious Murasame Castle) inspired by Nintendo video game designer Shigeru Miyamoto.
