The famed boxing franchise Ready 2 Rumble returns in 2009 when Atari launches Ready 2 Rumble: Revolution. Whilst maintaining all the humorous caricatures and fun boxing action that made the original Ready 2 Rumble Boxing Round1 and Round2 (Midway) such knock-out best-sellers, the new digitally sophisticated and visually stunning motion-controlled Ready 2 Rumble: Revolution for Wii brings a new level of style and attitude to the boxing ring and continues the franchise with a host of hard-hitting enhancements.
