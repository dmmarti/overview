Designed and developed exclusively for Wii, Overlord Dark Legend is a brand new action adventure steeped in fairy tale lore with sinister, satirical twists. Set in a time before the original game (Overlord, 2007), players step into the role of a new younger Overlord and revel in command of the most vicious, yet lovable little critters in gaming ? the Minions. Forming a unique rampaging army, the Minions are a demonic, slavish and loyal horde of imp-like critters predisposed to violence. No matter: they?re always ready and willing to follow even the most suicidal order, whether it's raiding villages for kicks and giggles or hurling themselves at enemies in the face of kamikaze odds in the beautifully rendered game world. With a story and characters that poke playful fun at fantasy clich√©, our trainee tyrant will be able to take his growing pains out on the local fairy tale inhabitants as he protects his castle and lands.
