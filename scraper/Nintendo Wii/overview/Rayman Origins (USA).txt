Ever wondered what lies at the root of the Rayman madness? Find out in Rayman Origins! Romp through a gigantic new Rayman universe that covers 12 worlds and 60 levels, and shows you the roots of Rayman. It comes stuffed with over 100 characters, so you never know who - or what - you might encounter! Pick up some bizarre new abilities, including dives, slaps, and the show-stopping HairlyCopter. Use your powers to battle bosses that get weirder (think evil, meat-eating flower) and more epic as the game goes on. Adventure in single player, or have friends join as Globox or one of two playable Teensies in drop-in/drop-out co-op play.
