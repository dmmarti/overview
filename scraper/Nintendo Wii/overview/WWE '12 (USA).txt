World Wrestling Entertainment enthusiasts try to take the title under a new title in WWE  12: a continuation of the series from THQ and Yuke s, with its due serving of raw smackdowns, despite the shortened name. The expanded roster includes contemporary stars such as John Cena, Randy Orton, and The Miz, as well as player-created Superstars, assigned custom entrances, finishing moves, and storylines. The game centers on a main campaign that runs through 18 months of WWE programming and two WrestleMania championships.
