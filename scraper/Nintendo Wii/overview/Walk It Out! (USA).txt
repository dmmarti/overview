Walk it Out! provides gamers on the Wii platform with a unique way to explore an inviting and entertaining gameworld, while staying active and social. Containing both local single player and multiplayer options, and supporting the DanceDanceRevolution (DDR) controller for Wii, the Wii Remote/Nunchuk configuration or Wii Balance Board, players walk to the rhythm of an in-game soundtrack, as well as take on a series of mini-games. With continued success the gameworld expands with new physical elements, as well as additional songs by popular artists which together keep the fun coming and players moving as they discover new challenges with each step they take.
