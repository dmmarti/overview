Players create their own programs to battle and defeat enemies in Tron: Evolution - Battle Grids. This version of Tron: Evolution also allows players to move around the world of Tron in Grid Tanks, Light Cycles, Recognizers or on foot for hand-to-hand combat. Story mode includes many games and some small hubs. In each hub there are programs with jobs, or quests that the player can complete for bits (bits can also be found scattered around the hubs). There is a cheat code system for unlocking in-game elements. Up to four players can play at the same time in local multiplayer (there is no online mode).
