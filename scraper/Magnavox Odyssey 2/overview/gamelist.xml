	<name>Alien Invaders - Plus</name>
	<desc>This is a Space Invaders variant with a twist. Eight robots with laser cannons and protected by a shield wall are advancing in the player's sector, and with his laser cannon he has to destroy them. The shield wall is indestructible, but the robots and the cannons aren't. They'll go from side to side of the screen in an alternate movement shooting down. Three high density molecular laser shields are placed in defense of the laser cannon. Each one of them houses an extra cannon.

Instead of a passing flying saucer as seen in Space Invaders, the player has to face the Merciless Monstroth, which shoots against him. The player controls a robot defender inside the laser cannon. If the laser cannon is destroyed, the robot will be left unprotected. The robot can enter in a new laser cannon housed in one of the shields. Once the new laser cannon is active, the shield is gone. Once the three shields are gone, the Merciless Monstroth will come down to hunt the player's cannon and robot.

The player wins a battle when destroying all enemy robots and cannons on the screen. A battle is lost when the player's robot is destroyed. The first side to win ten battles wins the war.</desc>

Armored Encounter! is a clone of Atari's Tank (AKA Combat). Two player-controlled tanks shoot at each other across a wide play field. Variations allow for different field layouts, land mines, and guided missiles.
In Sub Chase! players control an airplane and a submarine that scroll horizontally across the screen. Players score points for shooting the other, but lose points if a stray shot strikes one of two neutral vessels in the middle of the screen. In both games, the player who scores highest after three minutes wins.</desc>

	<path>./Blobbers, The (Europe).zip</path>
	<name>The Blobbers</name>
	<desc>In Blobbers the player controls a mobile laser unit trying to defend itself from the Blobbers, fearsome, giant, amoeba-like creatures that will devour anything they encounter. The mobile laser unit moves grounded to the sides of the screen area. The Blobbers will also move along the same sides, and as the laser gun can only shoot straight forward, the mobile laser unit has to be in the opposite side of the screen to hit the Blobbers.

A Blobber borns as a harmless small yellow spot, growing to a bigger and purple mass, to a bigger and white one until it reaches its red adult form. Only when it is red it can do harm to the mobile laser unit, if they are of any other color, they will only stick to the mobile laser unit until it moves and releases itself from the Blobber. As the time passes, an adult Blobber will multiply, releasing a new small yellow spot which will eventually grow into another adult Blobber. When Blobbers are hit, they are reduced to the immediate previous stage of development (from red to white, then purple, then yellow, then deceased).

In the middle of the screen, moving blocks called Magic Transporters move up and down randomly. They are called Magic Transporters because they can be used to transport the mobile laser unit from one side of the screen to the other, if the mobile laser unit moves onto one of them while they touch the top or bottom of the screen. The Blobbers will also be transported by them. Also, they are impenetrable by the laser gun, meaning the player will only be able to hit one Blobber when there are no Magic Transporters in the laser's way.

The Blobbers will become faster every 90 seconds until finally reaching the mobile laser unit's speed. The player has only one life and no continues.</desc>

If one or more numbers are parked in one of the points, the player can only additionally move to that point numbers which are lower than the last one already parked. The numbers can be moved one by one only and to do so the player has to type the letter of origin and then type the destiny letter. Moves can be undone by pressing the "clear" key.

The computer keeps track of the time elapsed and the number of moves made by the player, also showing the minimum amount of moves to solve the puzzle. There are 9 other possible variations, with the difference of having the way to point D blocked and different amounts of numbers to move. Those variations can be selected by pressing "reset" and the desired number, as follows:one figure - minimum number of moves: 1
2. two figures - minimum number of moves: 3
3. three figures - minimum number of moves: 7
4. four figures - minimum number of moves: 15
5. five figures - minimum number of moves: 31

	<name>Conquest of the World</name>
	<desc>Players choose to play as one of 43 countries and make it their homeland. Each country's military and diplomacy power is reflected by its real life counterpart during the early 1980's. Each country's relationship with one another is also reflected by how it is in real life.

Gameplay involves the use of a gameboard. Gameplay done on the game board contains information which is then entered into the Odyssey 2 for it to handle. Inside the game itself, players do battle by land, air, and sea. Battles involve players controlling either a jet (air force), tank (army), or a submarine (navy) and then battling the other players jet, tank, or submarine. These vehicles are dependent on supplies which are displayed as energy units. Every shot fired and movement made drains the players energy units. The battle ends when all the energy units run out. These combat results are then recorded on the gameboard, which then spurs further entries into the Odyssey 2.

Every battle won and alliance made will increase a country's power. The country with the most power at the end of the game wins.

Besides the gameboard map itself, the game also comes with a 100 power base unit indicators, a Homeland Marker, and six sets of Conquest/Alliance markers.</desc>

On the lower right, a counter marking, at the start of the mission, 1000 megajoules of remaining ship power. The ship needs one megajoule per second to sustain flight, ten megajoules per laser shot released and fifty megajoules per shot taken, to activate the deflector shields.

Three kinds of ships will assault the player's ship: invasion transports, battle frigates, and star fighters. The enemy fleet consists of five star fighters and ten ships randomly distributed among the remaining two kinds. Only star fighters represent a real threat, a general alert will sound and flash at the screen when one of those enter the player's range of sight.

1. Depth Charge is a single-player BattleShip variant. The player controls a cannon in a top-down view trying to destroy 7 submarines hidden in the area of water shown on screen. The area is a 8x8 grid, and the player controls a white cross-hair over it with the joystick. Pressing the action button will shoot the cannon. If a submarine is hidden in that particular area, a blue square will appear, marking it. If there are no submarines, the game will warn the player with a sound and that area will continue unmarked. There are submarines of 4 different sizes, with there being 3 with one section each, 2 with 2 sections each, 1 with 3 sections and 1 with 4 sections. The game keeps track of the number of shots tried by the player, and the total is shown at the end of the game, when all submarines are destroyed.

2. Marksman is a shooting gallery game. The player can choose between 2 game durations: 1 minute or 3 minutes. The game is played in a first person perspective, with the player seeing the rifle and the targets in front of it. A line of targets will scroll from right to left, bouncing up and down in front of the rifle and the player has to aim at them and shoot. There are 9 different targets which grant the player scores from 1 to 9 points each. When the player reaches 100 points, the targets start to move faster. The game ends when the time reaches 0:00 or when the player runs out of shots (starting with 24).</desc>

	<desc>Your task in this arcade conversion is to guide a frog across a treacherous road and river, and to safety at the top of the screen. Both these sections are fraught with a variety of hazards, each of which will kill the frog and cost you a life if contact is made.

The road is full of cars and trucks, at variable speeds. The river water itself is fatal, as are the snakes which hover within on later levels. Frogger must use the arrangement of logs, turtles (which are only there for a short time) and alligators (but stay away form their faces), and then jump into one of the open home-cells, ideally one containing a fly for extra points. Once all holes have been filled, you move onto the next, harder, level.</desc>

	<name>A Labyrinth Game + Supermind</name>
	<desc>Two titles are available in this cart:
A Labyrinth Game is exactly what the title defines. The player has to move a pawn from the left side of a labyrinth to the exit on the right side. Each match consists in a series of 10 and the labyrinth always changes when starting a new game. The pawn is controlled with the joystick and the "action" makes it move faster. There are 16 possible variations, including stationary and moving patterns and exits, for one player, two players or one player against the computer (a "Cat and Mouse" game where the computer plays a pawn which tries to catch the player's pawn).

Supermind is a code breaking game. Four question marks will be displayed, along with the number of symbols left to be entered (4 at the start). The player enters four symbols of choice and if they're correct but misplaced, a red number will appear in the right of the screen (with the number of correct symbols guessed). If the symbol is correct and placed in the right order, it will be displayed in white. The computer keeps track of the number of tries taken and the game ends when all symbols were discovered and placed in the right order.</desc>

	<name>Las Vegas Blackjack!</name>
	<desc>One or two players can play against the computer in this Blackjack game.

Each player starts with $1000. After placing their bets (through the keyboard), the dealer shuffles the cards and deals two face-up cards for each player and one face-up card and one face-down card to himself. He then asks the players to hit more cards or not (up to five). After each player has been dealt a full hand, the dealer reveals his face-down card. He'll take a hit if he has a total of 16 or less.

Blackjack or five cards without a bust pays double. The nearest to 21 hands pays even. No money is paid if there is a tie.

The computer offers an insurance bet if the dealer's first card is an ace. If the player accepts and the dealer goes blackjack, the player will lose no money. Otherwise, he will win or lose the current bet plus a half.

Sometimes the computer will also offer a double down. If the player accepts, the bet is doubled and he will get just one more card.</desc>

	<desc>In Loony Balloon, the player controls a kid carrying a swaying balloon crossing a playground. To get out of the playground, he must reduce the balloon's sway, or it will burst when he crosses the exit. To do so, he must earn 50 points by playing in the various amusements of the playground.

There are four kinds of amusements: a rocking horse, a slide, a roundabout and trees. The boy will also find threats to his balloon along the way, like birds that will cross the screen from left to right, trying to burst it, and sudden gusts of wind, which will take the balloon out from the boy's grasp if he stands still for too long.

The boy can release the balloon at any time and grab it again by its string (by pressing the action button). If the balloon hits a wall, it will burst and the game is over. The longer the game is played, the quicker the balloon rises if released.

The player scores:

1. 2 points by catching the balloon;
2. 5 points by playing at a tree;
3. 7 points by playing at the rocking horse;
4. 8 points by evading a bird;
5. 10 points by playing at the slide;
6. 12 points by playing at the roundabout;
7. 25 points by leaving the playground.

There are 10 difficulty levels. From levels 0 to 4, the playground layout is fixed. From levels 5 to 9, the walls in the playground will appear, disappear and change places.</desc>

	<name>Martian Threat</name>
	<desc>Martians are attacking the Earth and planning to destroy all life in it. A Martian space ship is orbiting the earth and a big laser cannon is being built on Earth and it is the player's mission to hold the Martian threat until the laser cannon is complete. To do so, the SIDO (Space Intruder Defense Organisation) infiltrated a fighting probe inside the Martian spaceship.

In Martian Threat the player controls a fighting probe with the joystick. The lack of gravity will make the probe keep moving until reverse thrust is given. The player has to shoot Martians and their energy bombs, which will appear in four different spots. The probe can only shoot diagonally. At the start, the Martian bombs are green and have little energy on them. As the game proceeds the bombs turn blue, purple and finally red. The probe can take up to ten hits from green bombs, but only three hits from red bombs. Additionally, the bombs will move faster and when they hit the probe they'll push it away. The probe explodes if it hits the space ship's walls.

The game has two possible endings. If the player succeeds in defending the Earth for 64 seconds (77 seconds in PAL systems), the laser defense will be finished and Earth will be saved. If the probe gets destroyed before that, the Martians will release their virus bomb and destroy all life on Earth.</desc>

	<name>Mission Impossible / Programmed Trip</name>
	<desc>Two titles are available in this cart:

Mission Impossible is an action game. The player must protect a cargo ship (white craft) which travels on a lay lines from bounty hunters (red crafts), which will destroy the cargo ship if they cross its way. As the cargo ship moves along the lay lines, the player must place NGR bots (green X symbols) at the lay line intersections to change traffic; the player has 7 NGR bots and can replace them. When any ships reaches an NGR bot, it will turn right if traveling vertically or turn toward the bottom of the screen when traveling horizontally. Red mushroom-shaped power ups, when picked up allow the cargo ship to destroy the bounty hunters; alternatively, bounty hunters can be simply directed to them and will be destroyed. White X marks will send the cargo ship back in the opposite way it was traveling; if hit by a bounty hunter, they will also send them back, but will be destroyed. Lilac squares are mines which will destroy any ship that passes over them. Finally, blue dots will give bounty hunters an extra life if taken by them. The player and the bounty hunters start with 15 lives each, the first to drop to zero loses.

Programmed Trip is a turn based game which shares many elements from the previous game. As the name implies, the player has to program the trip of the cargo field so it passes over pickup points (colored + symbols) in a specific order: first lilac, then red, then blue. To do so, NGR bots can be placed to redirect the ship, and some fields may also have White X marks already placed. After all desired NGR bots are placed, the player can release the cargo ship by placing the cursor over the upper left corner and pressing the action button. When the cargo ship is released the player has 30 points. Passing over pickup points in the correct order adds 20 points to the score, while passing over them in the wrong order or hitting any other item (NGR bots or white X marks, for instance) subtracts 10 points from the score. The game is over either when the score reaches 0 or when all pickup points were reached in the right order (in which case they'll turn white).</desc>

The player selects the game speed (4 to 30 words per minute) and level (1 to all 36 characters available). The computer will play the Morse signal for the first symbol (Q) and the player has to type in the symbol. After learning two signals, the game starts properly by introducing a row of trees in the top of the screen. An arrow is also displayed near the 4th tree from the left and a man on the right side. For each 10 correctly responded symbols the man takes down one tree. When he reaches the arrow, a new symbol is introduced and the process starts over again. The sequence of symbols is: Q, 7, Z, G, 0, 9, 8, O, 1, J, P, W, L, R, A, M, 6, B, X, D, Y, C, K, N, 2, 3, F, U, 4, 5, V, H, S, I, T and E.

2. The second type lets the player type individual symbols and listen to their respective codes.

3. The third type is similar to the second one, but in this one the player types a sequence of symbols and then press "enter" to ask the computer to play the respective code.

4. In the fourth type the player uses the "action" button of the joystick to enter codes into and the computer plays them and shows the respective symbol entered.</desc>

The only player to score is the mouse. He does so by eating the cheese pieces scattered through the room. To eat, the player controlling the mouse has to press and hold the "action" button. The longer the button stay pressed, the more it eats. If the mouse eats for a certain amount of time, it will grow bigger than the cat and will be immune for a short period of time.

The cat tries to catch the mouse by building a trap around it. To do so, the player controlling the cat has to move the cat around the mouse while pressing the "action" button. The cat has a limited amount of trap parts to use and the used ones can be picked up again by being walked over.

The game has 7 skill levels (with less trap parts for the mouse and both cat and mouse moving faster the higher the level is) and 8 possible variations (with stationary and moving cheese and obstacles for the mouse).</desc>

	<path>./Nightmare (Europe).zip</path>
	<name>Nightmare</name>
	<desc>In Nightmare the player controls a visitor to a haunted mansion. The goal is to escape from it through a constantly moving hatch in the attic. His job will be made harder by the ghosts who are still lingering around the house. The player has to climb three floors to reach the attic, and there is one ghost for each floor.

The ghosts become invisible as they cross the house's walls. While invisible they are harmless, so they have to make themselves visible to catch the visitor. They'll become invisible again if they cross the house walls again. If they catch the visitor, he'll lose one of his lives. But once the visitor has past the ghost's floor, the ghost will be paralyzed and can be caught by the visitor.

Besides the ghosts, other dangers threaten the visitor. A thunderstorm is breaking out and flashes of lightning hit the mansion, creating lightning balls which will roll through the floor the visitor is in. The flashes will also make the invisible ghosts visible while the lightnings strike. Besides, the visitor can't be standing still for too long or a trap door will open and he'll fall through it, losing a life. To make things even more difficult, there will be also a randomly placed obstacle blocking the visitor's way.

The player starts with three lives and gains one each time he escapes the mansion. As the player grows on points from reaching the attic or capturing the ghosts, the game gets more difficult. The number of obstacles increase and the exit becomes invisible unless the player captures a ghost. In higher difficulty levels catching a ghost won't be enough, as the player will have to also get the house's ground plan, which appears on a chest after he captures a ghost.

The game can be played by 2 players, one of them controlling the ghosts in the house.</desc>

	<desc>Three games are available in this compilation:

1. Pairs (selected by pressing "1") is the same game as Matchmaker!, a regular Memory game. A matrix with 20 letters appears on the screen and the player has to find pairs of symbols hidden by the letters. Two counters will be displayed: time and number of matches. In two players mode (selected by pressing "2"), the players share the matrix and the one who makes more matches win.

2. Space Rendezvous (selected by pressing "3") is somewhat similar to Lunar Lander. Two players have to try to link up their spaceships to the orbiting mother ship, while avoiding hitting the ground. Each ship has 50 megajoules of power and will be refueled when a perfect link-up is performed. A counter will be displayed for each player, and wins the player who first performs 10 perfect link-ups. If one player goes out of fuel, he's out of game.

3. Logic (selected by pressing "4") is the same game as Logix!. The player has to guess a sequence of five different digits. The player types in the first try and the computer will display a two digit number with the number of correct digits to the right and the number of correctly placed digits on the left. The player has then to continue guessing the sequence based on the clues given. The object is to solve the problem in the least number of tries, counted on the left on the screen.</desc>

Controlling his spaceship with the control stick and shooting laser blasts with the action button, the player must avoid falling lava, rocks, the serpent's laser rays. Shooting the serpent will stun it, and shooting the rocks will destroy them. If the ship goes out of screen by one of its sides, it will come back in the opposite side.

From times to times, Gryptogg, Raygoth and Arkus of the Extra-Terrestrial Alliance will open doors in the volcano firing a gravitational ray, which will drag the player's ship to it. The higher the score, the stronger the ray will be. It can be stopped by blasting the door with laser.

The player earns 3 points for blasting lava during volcanic eruption, 15 points for stunning the space serpent, 45 points for hitting an open door, 75 points for destroying a lava rock and 1000 points for surviving a volcanic eruption.</desc>

The Eskimo starts standing on a small island in the middle of the river. He must kill the sharks in the water by throwing harpoons at them. He can swim to the banks or to ice floes above and below the island. The sharks can eat the ice floes so it isn't safe for the Eskimo to stand on them for much time, or else he'll be eaten too.

The fish are held by six rows of nets. The sharks will eat those nets to get the fish, and if an entire row is destroyed, more sharks will come from the sea. The Eskimo can repair the nets by swimming to the place where they were destroyed. The more nets destroyed, the less fish is kept. A stage will end when all sharks are killed. At the end of each stage the remaining fish will be counted and added to the player's score. As the game progresses, sharks become more abundant and destroy the nets faster. The game ends when the Eskimo gets eaten by a shark.</desc>

	<name>Super Bee</name>
	<desc>In Super Bee the player controls a bee flying in a magic garden, where fruits keep popping everywhere. The fruits must be eaten (by flying over them), while avoiding to crash in the garden's fences (the edges of the screen). Additionally, when a fruit is eaten a magic barrier will appear, in the same direction in which the bee is flying, and it also must avoid crashing on them.

The player earns points by gathering fruits as follows:

1. Lemon (yellow): 5 points
2. Apple (red): 10 points
3. Pear (green): 15 points
4. Plum (grey): 20 points
5. Strawberry (red): 25 points

When the player reaches 105 points a bonus round takes place. A big spider appears in the screen, along with a fruit, for a limited time. Super Bee must avoid the spider and eat the fruit. By doing so the player earns 50 points. The next bonus rounds take place every 15 more points.

There are 10 skill levels available (by pressing 0 to 9), each one with different mazes.</desc>

	<name>Super Cobra</name>
	<desc>Super Cobra is a side scrolling shooter based on the arcade game. You're a chopper pilot on a surveillance mission in enemy territory; your goal is to make it through the various obstacle courses alive and score as many points as possible. Tall buildings, mountains, narrow tunnels, and various enemies (such as tanks, rockets, mines, and more) can all get in the way and destroy your chopper if you aren't careful. To help defend yourself, the chopper is armed with a machine gun and bombs which can be used to destroy the enemy tanks and rockets. To make the task more difficult, your chopper has a limited amount of fuel. Throughout the landscapes are fuel tanks; if one of these is shot or bombed, you will be awarded extra fuel. As the levels progress, the enemies become more aggressive, fuel becomes more scarce, and the landscape becomes trickier to navigate.</desc>

	<name>Turtles</name>
	<desc>Turtles, also known as Turpin, puts you into the role of the maternalistic turtle who tries to save the kidturtles from a bunch of bad bugs (or, in some versions, bad cars). It takes place in a Pacman-esque labyrinth, with turtle boxes in the centre and corners of the screen. Run into a box to release the turtle kid inside. Opening a box makes a little house show up, and you must go with the kidturtle to the house before you can release the next one. All the while, you must avoid the bugs/cars running around the maze. If they get too close, you can release a mine which will stun them temporarily. When you run out of mines, you must resupply by passing over a star in the centre of the screen. Beware, though, because the simpleminded bugs become smarter as time passes; this is symbolised by their changing colours. On later levels, those sneaky beetles can also come out of the boxes supposed to hold kidturtles. Watch out!

Each level is a floor in a house, and between levels you can see the turtle climbing to the next floor until it reaches the top.</desc>

	<name>UFO!</name>
	<desc>Description

Commanding of one of Earth Federation's robot-controlled battle cruisers, the player must protect Earth from an invasion of unidentified flying objects.

The ship is equipped with a laser cannon and a force field. The force field energy is drained when the ship's lasers are fired (by pressing the action button). The direction of the lasers is shown by a white dot in the force field, which rotates to aim in the direction the ship is moving.

There are three types of UFO's. The first one drifts randomly in space. The second, the Hunter-Killer, can detect the player's spaceship, linking with another one of the same type when it happens. The third one is a Light-speed Starship armed with computer-guided missiles.

The UFO's can be destroyed by laser blasts or by entering in touch with the force field in the player's ship. If the later happens, the force field energy is also drained.

The ship travels at half-speed when its force field is recharging. It goes from black (when depleted) to blue (when fully charged). The ship is vulnerable until the force field is completely recharged.

The player will earn 1 point for each random drifter destroyed, 3 points for each Hunter-Killer and 10 points for each Light-speed Starship.</desc>

	<name>Alien Invaders - Plus</name>
	<desc>This is a Space Invaders variant with a twist. Eight robots with laser cannons and protected by a shield wall are advancing in the player's sector, and with his laser cannon he has to destroy them. The shield wall is indestructible, but the robots and the cannons aren't. They'll go from side to side of the screen in an alternate movement shooting down. Three high density molecular laser shields are placed in defense of the laser cannon. Each one of them houses an extra cannon.

Instead of a passing flying saucer as seen in Space Invaders, the player has to face the Merciless Monstroth, which shoots against him. The player controls a robot defender inside the laser cannon. If the laser cannon is destroyed, the robot will be left unprotected. The robot can enter in a new laser cannon housed in one of the shields. Once the new laser cannon is active, the shield is gone. Once the three shields are gone, the Merciless Monstroth will come down to hunt the player's cannon and robot.

The player wins a battle when destroying all enemy robots and cannons on the screen. A battle is lost when the player's robot is destroyed. The first side to win ten battles wins the war.</desc>

	<name>The Blobbers</name>
	<desc>In Blobbers the player controls a mobile laser unit trying to defend itself from the Blobbers, fearsome, giant, amoeba-like creatures that will devour anything they encounter. The mobile laser unit moves grounded to the sides of the screen area. The Blobbers will also move along the same sides, and as the laser gun can only shoot straight forward, the mobile laser unit has to be in the opposite side of the screen to hit the Blobbers.

A Blobber borns as a harmless small yellow spot, growing to a bigger and purple mass, to a bigger and white one until it reaches its red adult form. Only when it is red it can do harm to the mobile laser unit, if they are of any other color, they will only stick to the mobile laser unit until it moves and releases itself from the Blobber. As the time passes, an adult Blobber will multiply, releasing a new small yellow spot which will eventually grow into another adult Blobber. When Blobbers are hit, they are reduced to the immediate previous stage of development (from red to white, then purple, then yellow, then deceased).

In the middle of the screen, moving blocks called Magic Transporters move up and down randomly. They are called Magic Transporters because they can be used to transport the mobile laser unit from one side of the screen to the other, if the mobile laser unit moves onto one of them while they touch the top or bottom of the screen. The Blobbers will also be transported by them. Also, they are impenetrable by the laser gun, meaning the player will only be able to hit one Blobber when there are no Magic Transporters in the laser's way.

The Blobbers will become faster every 90 seconds until finally reaching the mobile laser unit's speed. The player has only one life and no continues.</desc>

If one or more numbers are parked in one of the points, the player can only additionally move to that point numbers which are lower than the last one already parked. The numbers can be moved one by one only and to do so the player has to type the letter of origin and then type the destiny letter. Moves can be undone by pressing the "clear" key.

The computer keeps track of the time elapsed and the number of moves made by the player, also showing the minimum amount of moves to solve the puzzle. There are 9 other possible variations, with the difference of having the way to point D blocked and different amounts of numbers to move. Those variations can be selected by pressing "reset" and the desired number, as follows:one figure - minimum number of moves: 1
2. two figures - minimum number of moves: 3
3. three figures - minimum number of moves: 7
4. four figures - minimum number of moves: 15
5. five figures - minimum number of moves: 31
6. six figures - minimum number of moves: 63
7. seven figures - minimum number of moves: 127
8. eight figures - minimum number of moves: 255
9. nine figures - minimum number of moves: 511</desc>

	<name>Conquest of the World</name>
	<desc>Players choose to play as one of 43 countries and make it their homeland. Each country's military and diplomacy power is reflected by its real life counterpart during the early 1980's. Each country's relationship with one another is also reflected by how it is in real life.

Gameplay involves the use of a gameboard. Gameplay done on the game board contains information which is then entered into the Odyssey 2 for it to handle. Inside the game itself, players do battle by land, air, and sea. Battles involve players controlling either a jet (air force), tank (army), or a submarine (navy) and then battling the other players jet, tank, or submarine. These vehicles are dependent on supplies which are displayed as energy units. Every shot fired and movement made drains the players energy units. The battle ends when all the energy units run out. These combat results are then recorded on the gameboard, which then spurs further entries into the Odyssey 2.

Every battle won and alliance made will increase a country's power. The country with the most power at the end of the game wins.

Besides the gameboard map itself, the game also comes with a 100 power base unit indicators, a Homeland Marker, and six sets of Conquest/Alliance markers.</desc>

	<desc>The player is a legendary hero of the Earth Federation, in command of a Centurion star fighter and must defend the galaxy from the Imperial ships attack.

From a first person perspective, the player must destroy fifteen enemy ships. A counter at the lower left corner of the screen shows how many ships are left. On the lower right, a counter marking, at the start of the mission, 1000 megajoules of remaining ship power. The ship needs one megajoule per second to sustain flight, ten megajoules per laser shot released and fifty megajoules per shot taken, to activate the deflector shields.

Three kinds of ships will assault the player's ship: invasion transports, battle frigates, and star fighters. The enemy fleet consists of five star fighters and ten ships randomly distributed among the remaining two kinds. Only star fighters represent a real threat, a general alert will sound and flash at the screen when one of those enter the player's range of sight.

The mission ends when all enemy ships are destroyed or when all the ship's fuel is used.</desc>

	<desc>Two titles are available in this cart:

1. Depth Charge is a single-player BattleShip variant. The player controls a cannon in a top-down view trying to destroy 7 submarines hidden in the area of water shown on screen. The area is a 8x8 grid, and the player controls a white cross-hair over it with the joystick. Pressing the action button will shoot the cannon. If a submarine is hidden in that particular area, a blue square will appear, marking it. If there are no submarines, the game will warn the player with a sound and that area will continue unmarked. There are submarines of 4 different sizes, with there being 3 with one section each, 2 with 2 sections each, 1 with 3 sections and 1 with 4 sections. The game keeps track of the number of shots tried by the player, and the total is shown at the end of the game, when all submarines are destroyed.

2. Marksman is a shooting gallery game. The player can choose between 2 game durations: 1 minute or 3 minutes. The game is played in a first person perspective, with the player seeing the rifle and the targets in front of it. A line of targets will scroll from right to left, bouncing up and down in front of the rifle and the player has to aim at them and shoot. There are 9 different targets which grant the player scores from 1 to 9 points each. When the player reaches 100 points, the targets start to move faster. The game ends when the time reaches 0:00 or when the player runs out of shots (starting with 24).</desc>

A Labyrinth Game is exactly what the title defines. The player has to move a pawn from the left side of a labyrinth to the exit on the right side. Each match consists in a series of 10 and the labyrinth always changes when starting a new game. The pawn is controlled with the joystick and the "action" makes it move faster. There are 16 possible variations, including stationary and moving patterns and exits, for one player, two players or one player against the computer (a "Cat and Mouse" game where the computer plays a pawn which tries to catch the player's pawn).

Supermind is a code breaking game. Four question marks will be displayed, along with the number of symbols left to be entered (4 at the start). The player enters four symbols of choice and if they're correct but misplaced, a red number will appear in the right of the screen (with the number of correct symbols guessed). If the symbol is correct and placed in the right order, it will be displayed in white. The computer keeps track of the number of tries taken and the game ends when all symbols were discovered and placed in the right order.</desc>

	<name>Las Vegas Blackjack!</name>
	<desc>One or two players can play against the computer in this Blackjack game.

Each player starts with $1000. After placing their bets (through the keyboard), the dealer shuffles the cards and deals two face-up cards for each player and one face-up card and one face-down card to himself. He then asks the players to hit more cards or not (up to five). After each player has been dealt a full hand, the dealer reveals his face-down card. He'll take a hit if he has a total of 16 or less.

Blackjack or five cards without a bust pays double. The nearest to 21 hands pays even. No money is paid if there is a tie.

The computer offers an insurance bet if the dealer's first card is an ace. If the player accepts and the dealer goes blackjack, the player will lose no money. Otherwise, he will win or lose the current bet plus a half.

Sometimes the computer will also offer a double down. If the player accepts, the bet is doubled and he will get just one more card.</desc>

There are four kinds of amusements: a rocking horse, a slide, a roundabout and trees. The boy will also find threats to his balloon along the way, like birds that will cross the screen from left to right, trying to burst it, and sudden gusts of wind, which will take the balloon out from the boy's grasp if he stands still for too long.

The boy can release the balloon at any time and grab it again by its string (by pressing the action button). If the balloon hits a wall, it will burst and the game is over. The longer the game is played, the quicker the balloon rises if released.

The player scores:

1. 2 points by catching the balloon;
2. 5 points by playing at a tree;
3. 7 points by playing at the rocking horse;
4. 8 points by evading a bird;
5. 10 points by playing at the slide;
6. 12 points by playing at the roundabout;
7. 25 points by leaving the playground.

There are 10 difficulty levels. From levels 0 to 4, the playground layout is fixed. From levels 5 to 9, the walls in the playground will appear, disappear and change places.</desc>

	<path>./Martian Threat (Europe) (Proto).bin</path>
	<name>Martian Threat</name>
	<desc>Martians are attacking the Earth and planning to destroy all life in it. A Martian space ship is orbiting the earth and a big laser cannon is being built on Earth and it is the player's mission to hold the Martian threat until the laser cannon is complete. To do so, the SIDO (Space Intruder Defense Organisation) infiltrated a fighting probe inside the Martian spaceship.

In Martian Threat the player controls a fighting probe with the joystick. The lack of gravity will make the probe keep moving until reverse thrust is given. The player has to shoot Martians and their energy bombs, which will appear in four different spots. The probe can only shoot diagonally. At the start, the Martian bombs are green and have little energy on them. As the game proceeds the bombs turn blue, purple and finally red. The probe can take up to ten hits from green bombs, but only three hits from red bombs. Additionally, the bombs will move faster and when they hit the probe they'll push it away. The probe explodes if it hits the space ship's walls.

The game has two possible endings. If the player succeeds in defending the Earth for 64 seconds (77 seconds in PAL systems), the laser defense will be finished and Earth will be saved. If the probe gets destroyed before that, the Martians will release their virus bomb and destroy all life on Earth.</desc>

	<path>./Mission Impossible + Programmed Trip (Brazil) (Proto).bin</path>
	<name>Mission Impossible / Programmed Trip</name>
	<desc>Two titles are available in this cart:

Mission Impossible is an action game. The player must protect a cargo ship (white craft) which travels on a lay lines from bounty hunters (red crafts), which will destroy the cargo ship if they cross its way. As the cargo ship moves along the lay lines, the player must place NGR bots (green X symbols) at the lay line intersections to change traffic; the player has 7 NGR bots and can replace them. When any ships reaches an NGR bot, it will turn right if traveling vertically or turn toward the bottom of the screen when traveling horizontally. Red mushroom-shaped power ups, when picked up allow the cargo ship to destroy the bounty hunters; alternatively, bounty hunters can be simply directed to them and will be destroyed. White X marks will send the cargo ship back in the opposite way it was traveling; if hit by a bounty hunter, they will also send them back, but will be destroyed. Lilac squares are mines which will destroy any ship that passes over them. Finally, blue dots will give bounty hunters an extra life if taken by them. The player and the bounty hunters start with 15 lives each, the first to drop to zero loses.

Programmed Trip is a turn based game which shares many elements from the previous game. As the name implies, the player has to program the trip of the cargo field so it passes over pickup points (colored + symbols) in a specific order: first lilac, then red, then blue. To do so, NGR bots can be placed to redirect the ship, and some fields may also have White X marks already placed. After all desired NGR bots are placed, the player can release the cargo ship by placing the cursor over the upper left corner and pressing the action button. When the cargo ship is released the player has 30 points. Passing over pickup points in the correct order adds 20 points to the score, while passing over them in the wrong order or hitting any other item (NGR bots or white X marks, for instance) subtracts 10 points from the score. The game is over either when the score reaches 0 or when all pickup points were reached in the right order (in which case they'll turn white).</desc>

	<desc>Morse teaches the code to players. There are 4 types of games which can be selected in a menu screen:The first type is a Morse code learning game. The player selects the game speed (4 to 30 words per minute) and level (1 to all 36 characters available). The computer will play the Morse signal for the first symbol (Q) and the player has to type in the symbol. After learning two signals, the game starts properly by introducing a row of trees in the top of the screen. An arrow is also displayed near the 4th tree from the left and a man on the right side. For each 10 correctly responded symbols the man takes down one tree. When he reaches the arrow, a new symbol is introduced and the process starts over again. The sequence of symbols is: Q, 7, Z, G, 0, 9, 8, O, 1, J, P, W, L, R, A, M, 6, B, X, D, Y, C, K, N, 2, 3, F, U, 4, 5, V, H, S, I, T and E.

2. The second type lets the player type individual symbols and listen to their respective codes.

3. The third type is similar to the second one, but in this one the player types a sequence of symbols and then press "enter" to ask the computer to play the respective code.

4. In the fourth type the player uses the "action" button of the joystick to enter codes into and the computer plays them and shows the respective symbol entered.</desc>

	<desc>The Mousing Cat is another game about the eternal conflict between felines and rodents. The game consists in a series of six encounters in which the players alternate the roles of cat and mouse (three times each). The winner is the player with most points at the end of the series.

The only player to score is the mouse. He does so by eating the cheese pieces scattered through the room. To eat, the player controlling the mouse has to press and hold the "action" button. The longer the button stay pressed, the more it eats. If the mouse eats for a certain amount of time, it will grow bigger than the cat and will be immune for a short period of time.

The cat tries to catch the mouse by building a trap around it. To do so, the player controlling the cat has to move the cat around the mouse while pressing the "action" button. The cat has a limited amount of trap parts to use and the used ones can be picked up again by being walked over.

The game has 7 skill levels (with less trap parts for the mouse and both cat and mouse moving faster the higher the level is) and 8 possible variations (with stationary and moving cheese and obstacles for the mouse).</desc>

	<name>Nightmare</name>
	<desc>In Nightmare the player controls a visitor to a haunted mansion. The goal is to escape from it through a constantly moving hatch in the attic. His job will be made harder by the ghosts who are still lingering around the house. The player has to climb three floors to reach the attic, and there is one ghost for each floor.

The ghosts become invisible as they cross the house's walls. While invisible they are harmless, so they have to make themselves visible to catch the visitor. They'll become invisible again if they cross the house walls again. If they catch the visitor, he'll lose one of his lives. But once the visitor has past the ghost's floor, the ghost will be paralyzed and can be caught by the visitor.

Besides the ghosts, other dangers threaten the visitor. A thunderstorm is breaking out and flashes of lightning hit the mansion, creating lightning balls which will roll through the floor the visitor is in. The flashes will also make the invisible ghosts visible while the lightnings strike. Besides, the visitor can't be standing still for too long or a trap door will open and he'll fall through it, losing a life. To make things even more difficult, there will be also a randomly placed obstacle blocking the visitor's way.

The player starts with three lives and gains one each time he escapes the mansion. As the player grows on points from reaching the attic or capturing the ghosts, the game gets more difficult. The number of obstacles increase and the exit becomes invisible unless the player captures a ghost. In higher difficulty levels catching a ghost won't be enough, as the player will have to also get the house's ground plan, which appears on a chest after he captures a ghost.

The game can be played by 2 players, one of them controlling the ghosts in the house.</desc>

In two players mode (selected by pressing "2"), the players share the matrix and the one who makes more matches win.

2. Space Rendezvous (selected by pressing "3") is somewhat similar to Lunar Lander. Two players have to try to link up their spaceships to the orbiting mother ship, while avoiding hitting the ground. Each ship has 50 megajoules of power and will be refueled when a perfect link-up is performed. A counter will be displayed for each player, and wins the player who first performs 10 perfect link-ups. If one player goes out of fuel, he's out of game.

3. Logic (selected by pressing "4") is the same game as Logix!. The player has to guess a sequence of five different digits. The player types in the first try and the computer will display a two digit number with the number of correct digits to the right and the number of correctly placed digits on the left.

The player earns 3 points for blasting lava during volcanic eruption, 15 points for stunning the space serpent, 45 points for hitting an open door, 75 points for destroying a lava rock and 1000 points for surviving a volcanic eruption.</desc>

The screen is horizontally divided in the half, and the pyramids have four blocks in the lower layer (or higher for the top player), three in the middle and one at the top (or bottom for the top player). Each block has two possible positions for placing the stones, and after the players place them, a number will appear above (for the up player) or below (for the down player), showing how many of them are correctly placed. Players must then relocate the stones until all of them are placed correctly. When it is done, the higher (or lower) layer of blocks will be liberated. The player who first places all the stones correctly in all the layers wins.</desc>

The Eskimo starts standing on a small island in the middle of the river. He must kill the sharks in the water by throwing harpoons at them. He can swim to the banks or to ice floes above and below the island. The sharks can eat the ice floes so it isn't safe for the Eskimo to stand on them for much time, or else he'll be eaten too.

The fish are held by six rows of nets. The sharks will eat those nets to get the fish, and if an entire row is destroyed, more sharks will come from the sea. The Eskimo can repair the nets by swimming to the place where they were destroyed. The more nets destroyed, the less fish is kept. A stage will end when all sharks are killed. At the end of each stage the remaining fish will be counted and added to the player's score. As the game progresses, sharks become more abundant and destroy the nets faster. The game ends when the Eskimo gets eaten by a shark.</desc>

The bombs can be defused or avoided to get to the top, but just make sure you aren't too close to one that explodes! Once you arrive at the top of the tower, Green Goblin himself will be protecting the super bomb he has planted there. If you can sneak past Green Goblin and defuse the super bomb, the level is complete and you then move on to the next, more challenging level.</desc>

The fruits must be eaten (by flying over them), while avoiding to crash in the garden's fences (the edges of the screen). Additionally, when a fruit is eaten a magic barrier will appear, in the same direction in which the bee is flying, and it also must avoid crashing on them.

The player earns points by gathering fruits as follows:

1. Lemon (yellow): 5 points
2. Apple (red): 10 points
3. Pear (green): 15 points
4. Plum (grey): 20 points
5. Strawberry (red): 25 points

When the player reaches 105 points a bonus round takes place. A big spider appears in the screen, along with a fruit, for a limited time. Super Bee must avoid the spider and eat the fruit. By doing so the player earns 50 points. The next bonus rounds take place every 15 more points.

There are 10 skill levels available (by pressing 0 to 9), each one with different mazes.</desc>

Tall buildings, mountains, narrow tunnels, and various enemies (such as tanks, rockets, mines, and more) can all get in the way and destroy your chopper if you aren't careful. To help defend yourself, the chopper is armed with a machine gun and bombs which can be used to destroy the enemy tanks and rockets. To make the task more difficult, your chopper has a limited amount of fuel. Throughout the landscapes are fuel tanks; if one of these is shot or bombed, you will be awarded extra fuel. As the levels progress, the enemies become more aggressive, fuel becomes more scarce, and the landscape becomes trickier to navigate.</desc>

It takes place in a Pacman-esque labyrinth, with turtle boxes in the centre and corners of the screen. Run into a box to release the turtle kid inside. Opening a box makes a little house show up, and you must go with the kidturtle to the house before you can release the next one. All the while, you must avoid the bugs/cars running around the maze. If they get too close, you can release a mine which will stun them temporarily. When you run out of mines, you must resupply by passing over a star in the centre of the screen. Beware, though, because the simpleminded bugs become smarter as time passes; this is symbolised by their changing colours. On later levels, those sneaky beetles can also come out of the boxes supposed to hold kidturtles. Watch out!

Each level is a floor in a house, and between levels you can see the turtle climbing to the next floor until it reaches the top.</desc>

	<desc>Description

Commanding of one of Earth Federation's robot-controlled battle cruisers, the player must protect Earth from an invasion of unidentified flying objects.

The ship is equipped with a laser cannon and a force field. The force field energy is drained when the ship's lasers are fired (by pressing the action button). The direction of the lasers is shown by a white dot in the force field, which rotates to aim in the direction the ship is moving.

There are three types of UFO's. The first one drifts randomly in space. The second, the Hunter-Killer, can detect the player's spaceship, linking with another one of the same type when it happens. The third one is a Light-speed Starship armed with computer-guided missiles.

The UFO's can be destroyed by laser blasts or by entering in touch with the force field in the player's ship. If the later happens, the force field energy is also drained.

The ship travels at half-speed when its force field is recharging. It goes from black (when depleted) to blue (when fully charged). The ship is vulnerable until the force field is completely recharged.

The player will earn 1 point for each random drifter destroyed, 3 points for each Hunter-Killer and 10 points for each Light-speed Starship.</desc>

	<desc>This is a Space Invaders variant with a twist. Eight robots with laser cannons and protected by a shield wall are advancing in the player's sector, and with his laser cannon he has to destroy them. The shield wall is indestructible, but the robots and the cannons aren't. They'll go from side to side of the screen in an alternate movement shooting down. Three high density molecular laser shields are placed in defense of the laser cannon. Each one of them houses an extra cannon.

Instead of a passing flying saucer as seen in Space Invaders, the player has to face the Merciless Monstroth, which shoots against him. The player controls a robot defender inside the laser cannon. If the laser cannon is destroyed, the robot will be left unprotected. The robot can enter in a new laser cannon housed in one of the shields. Once the new laser cannon is active, the shield is gone. Once the three shields are gone, the Merciless Monstroth will come down to hunt the player's cannon and robot.

The player wins a battle when destroying all enemy robots and cannons on the screen. A battle is lost when the player's robot is destroyed. The first side to win ten battles wins the war.</desc>

	<desc>War is hell, but this Multi-Mode cartridge makes it fun. 
Armored Encounter! is a clone of Atari's Tank (AKA Combat). Two player-controlled tanks shoot at each other across a wide play field. Variations allow for different field layouts, land mines, and guided missiles.
In Sub Chase! players control an airplane and a submarine that scroll horizontally across the screen. Players score points for shooting the other, but lose points if a stray shot strikes one of two neutral vessels in the middle of the screen. In both games, the player who scores highest after three minutes wins.</desc>

	<path>./Blobbers, The (Europe).bin</path>
	<name>The Blobbers</name>
	<desc>In Blobbers the player controls a mobile laser unit trying to defend itself from the Blobbers, fearsome, giant, amoeba-like creatures that will devour anything they encounter. The mobile laser unit moves grounded to the sides of the screen area. The Blobbers will also move along the same sides, and as the laser gun can only shoot straight forward, the mobile laser unit has to be in the opposite side of the screen to hit the Blobbers.

A Blobber borns as a harmless small yellow spot, growing to a bigger and purple mass, to a bigger and white one until it reaches its red adult form. Only when it is red it can do harm to the mobile laser unit, if they are of any other color, they will only stick to the mobile laser unit until it moves and releases itself from the Blobber. As the time passes, an adult Blobber will multiply, releasing a new small yellow spot which will eventually grow into another adult Blobber. When Blobbers are hit, they are reduced to the immediate previous stage of development (from red to white, then purple, then yellow, then deceased).

In the middle of the screen, moving blocks called Magic Transporters move up and down randomly. They are called Magic Transporters because they can be used to transport the mobile laser unit from one side of the screen to the other, if the mobile laser unit moves onto one of them while they touch the top or bottom of the screen. The Blobbers will also be transported by them. Also, they are impenetrable by the laser gun, meaning the player will only be able to hit one Blobber when there are no Magic Transporters in the laser's way.

The Blobbers will become faster every 90 seconds until finally reaching the mobile laser unit's speed. The player has only one life and no continues.</desc>

If one or more numbers are parked in one of the points, the player can only additionally move to that point numbers which are lower than the last one already parked. The numbers can be moved one by one only and to do so the player has to type the letter of origin and then type the destiny letter. Moves can be undone by pressing the "clear" key.

The computer keeps track of the time elapsed and the number of moves made by the player, also showing the minimum amount of moves to solve the puzzle. There are 9 other possible variations, with the difference of having the way to point D blocked and different amounts of numbers to move. Those variations can be selected by pressing "reset" and the desired number, as follows:one figure - minimum number of moves: 1
2. two figures - minimum number of moves: 3
3. three figures - minimum number of moves: 7
4. four figures - minimum number of moves: 15
5. five figures - minimum number of moves: 31
6. six figures - minimum number of moves: 63

	<name>Conquest of the World</name>
	<desc>Players choose to play as one of 43 countries and make it their homeland. Each country's military and diplomacy power is reflected by its real life counterpart during the early 1980's. Each country's relationship with one another is also reflected by how it is in real life.

Gameplay involves the use of a gameboard. Gameplay done on the game board contains information which is then entered into the Odyssey 2 for it to handle. Inside the game itself, players do battle by land, air, and sea. Battles involve players controlling either a jet (air force), tank (army), or a submarine (navy) and then battling the other players jet, tank, or submarine. These vehicles are dependent on supplies which are displayed as energy units. Every shot fired and movement made drains the players energy units. The battle ends when all the energy units run out. These combat results are then recorded on the gameboard, which then spurs further entries into the Odyssey 2.

Every battle won and alliance made will increase a country's power. The country with the most power at the end of the game wins.

Besides the gameboard map itself, the game also comes with a 100 power base unit indicators, a Homeland Marker, and six sets of Conquest/Alliance markers.</desc>

From a first person perspective, the player must destroy fifteen enemy ships. A counter at the lower left corner of the screen shows how many ships are left. On the lower right, a counter marking, at the start of the mission, 1000 megajoules of remaining ship power. The ship needs one megajoule per second to sustain flight, ten megajoules per laser shot released and fifty megajoules per shot taken, to activate the deflector shields.

Three kinds of ships will assault the player's ship: invasion transports, battle frigates, and star fighters. The enemy fleet consists of five star fighters and ten ships randomly distributed among the remaining two kinds. Only star fighters represent a real threat, a general alert will sound and flash at the screen when one of those enter the player's range of sight.

The mission ends when all enemy ships are destroyed or when all the ship's fuel is used.</desc>

1. Depth Charge is a single-player BattleShip variant. The player controls a cannon in a top-down view trying to destroy 7 submarines hidden in the area of water shown on screen. The area is a 8x8 grid, and the player controls a white cross-hair over it with the joystick. Pressing the action button will shoot the cannon. If a submarine is hidden in that particular area, a blue square will appear, marking it. If there are no submarines, the game will warn the player with a sound and that area will continue unmarked. There are submarines of 4 different sizes, with there being 3 with one section each, 2 with 2 sections each, 1 with 3 sections and 1 with 4 sections. The game keeps track of the number of shots tried by the player, and the total is shown at the end of the game, when all submarines are destroyed.

2. Marksman is a shooting gallery game. The player can choose between 2 game durations: 1 minute or 3 minutes. The game is played in a first person perspective, with the player seeing the rifle and the targets in front of it. A line of targets will scroll from right to left, bouncing up and down in front of the rifle and the player has to aim at them and shoot. There are 9 different targets which grant the player scores from 1 to 9 points each. When the player reaches 100 points, the targets start to move faster. The game ends when the time reaches 0:00 or when the player runs out of shots (starting with 24).</desc>

	<name>A Labyrinth Game + Supermind</name>
	<desc>Two titles are available in this cart:
A Labyrinth Game is exactly what the title defines. The player has to move a pawn from the left side of a labyrinth to the exit on the right side. Each match consists in a series of 10 and the labyrinth always changes when starting a new game. The pawn is controlled with the joystick and the "action" makes it move faster. There are 16 possible variations, including stationary and moving patterns and exits, for one player, two players or one player against the computer (a "Cat and Mouse" game where the computer plays a pawn which tries to catch the player's pawn).

Supermind is a code breaking game. Four question marks will be displayed, along with the number of symbols left to be entered (4 at the start). The player enters four symbols of choice and if they're correct but misplaced, a red number will appear in the right of the screen (with the number of correct symbols guessed). If the symbol is correct and placed in the right order, it will be displayed in white. The computer keeps track of the number of tries taken and the game ends when all symbols were discovered and placed in the right order.</desc>

	<name>Las Vegas Blackjack!</name>
	<desc>One or two players can play against the computer in this Blackjack game.

Each player starts with $1000. After placing their bets (through the keyboard), the dealer shuffles the cards and deals two face-up cards for each player and one face-up card and one face-down card to himself. He then asks the players to hit more cards or not (up to five). After each player has been dealt a full hand, the dealer reveals his face-down card. He'll take a hit if he has a total of 16 or less.

Blackjack or five cards without a bust pays double. The nearest to 21 hands pays even. No money is paid if there is a tie.

The computer offers an insurance bet if the dealer's first card is an ace. If the player accepts and the dealer goes blackjack, the player will lose no money. Otherwise, he will win or lose the current bet plus a half.

Sometimes the computer will also offer a double down. If the player accepts, the bet is doubled and he will get just one more card.</desc>

	<name>Loony Balloon</name>
	<desc>In Loony Balloon, the player controls a kid carrying a swaying balloon crossing a playground. To get out of the playground, he must reduce the balloon's sway, or it will burst when he crosses the exit. To do so, he must earn 50 points by playing in the various amusements of the playground.

There are four kinds of amusements: a rocking horse, a slide, a roundabout and trees. The boy will also find threats to his balloon along the way, like birds that will cross the screen from left to right, trying to burst it, and sudden gusts of wind, which will take the balloon out from the boy's grasp if he stands still for too long.

The boy can release the balloon at any time and grab it again by its string (by pressing the action button). If the balloon hits a wall, it will burst and the game is over. The longer the game is played, the quicker the balloon rises if released.

The player scores:

1. 2 points by catching the balloon;
2. 5 points by playing at a tree;
3. 7 points by playing at the rocking horse;
4. 8 points by evading a bird;
5. 10 points by playing at the slide;
6. 12 points by playing at the roundabout;
7. 25 points by leaving the playground.

There are 10 difficulty levels. From levels 0 to 4, the playground layout is fixed. From levels 5 to 9, the walls in the playground will appear, disappear and change places.</desc>

	<path>./Martian Threat (Europe) (Proto).bin</path>
	<name>Martian Threat</name>
	<desc>Martians are attacking the Earth and planning to destroy all life in it. A Martian space ship is orbiting the earth and a big laser cannon is being built on Earth and it is the player's mission to hold the Martian threat until the laser cannon is complete. To do so, the SIDO (Space Intruder Defense Organisation) infiltrated a fighting probe inside the Martian spaceship.

In Martian Threat the player controls a fighting probe with the joystick. The lack of gravity will make the probe keep moving until reverse thrust is given. The player has to shoot Martians and their energy bombs, which will appear in four different spots. The probe can only shoot diagonally. At the start, the Martian bombs are green and have little energy on them. As the game proceeds the bombs turn blue, purple and finally red. The probe can take up to ten hits from green bombs, but only three hits from red bombs. Additionally, the bombs will move faster and when they hit the probe they'll push it away. The probe explodes if it hits the space ship's walls.

The game has two possible endings. If the player succeeds in defending the Earth for 64 seconds (77 seconds in PAL systems), the laser defense will be finished and Earth will be saved. If the probe gets destroyed before that, the Martians will release their virus bomb and destroy all life on Earth.</desc>

	<name>Mission Impossible / Programmed Trip</name>
	<desc>Two titles are available in this cart:

Mission Impossible is an action game. The player must protect a cargo ship (white craft) which travels on a lay lines from bounty hunters (red crafts), which will destroy the cargo ship if they cross its way. As the cargo ship moves along the lay lines, the player must place NGR bots (green X symbols) at the lay line intersections to change traffic; the player has 7 NGR bots and can replace them. When any ships reaches an NGR bot, it will turn right if traveling vertically or turn toward the bottom of the screen when traveling horizontally. Red mushroom-shaped power ups, when picked up allow the cargo ship to destroy the bounty hunters; alternatively, bounty hunters can be simply directed to them and will be destroyed. White X marks will send the cargo ship back in the opposite way it was traveling; if hit by a bounty hunter, they will also send them back, but will be destroyed. Lilac squares are mines which will destroy any ship that passes over them. Finally, blue dots will give bounty hunters an extra life if taken by them. The player and the bounty hunters start with 15 lives each, the first to drop to zero loses.

Programmed Trip is a turn based game which shares many elements from the previous game. As the name implies, the player has to program the trip of the cargo field so it passes over pickup points (colored + symbols) in a specific order: first lilac, then red, then blue. To do so, NGR bots can be placed to redirect the ship, and some fields may also have White X marks already placed. After all desired NGR bots are placed, the player can release the cargo ship by placing the cursor over the upper left corner and pressing the action button. When the cargo ship is released the player has 30 points. Passing over pickup points in the correct order adds 20 points to the score, while passing over them in the wrong order or hitting any other item (NGR bots or white X marks, for instance) subtracts 10 points from the score. The game is over either when the score reaches 0 or when all pickup points were reached in the right order (in which case they'll turn white).</desc>

The player selects the game speed (4 to 30 words per minute) and level (1 to all 36 characters available). The computer will play the Morse signal for the first symbol (Q) and the player has to type in the symbol. After learning two signals, the game starts properly by introducing a row of trees in the top of the screen. An arrow is also displayed near the 4th tree from the left and a man on the right side. For each 10 correctly responded symbols the man takes down one tree. When he reaches the arrow, a new symbol is introduced and the process starts over again. The sequence of symbols is: Q, 7, Z, G, 0, 9, 8, O, 1, J, P, W, L, R, A, M, 6, B, X, D, Y, C, K, N, 2, 3, F, U, 4, 5, V, H, S, I, T and E.

2. The second type lets the player type individual symbols and listen to their respective codes.

3. The third type is similar to the second one, but in this one the player types a sequence of symbols and then press "enter" to ask the computer to play the respective code.

4. In the fourth type the player uses the "action" button of the joystick to enter codes into and the computer plays them and shows the respective symbol entered.</desc>

The only player to score is the mouse. He does so by eating the cheese pieces scattered through the room. To eat, the player controlling the mouse has to press and hold the "action" button. The longer the button stay pressed, the more it eats. If the mouse eats for a certain amount of time, it will grow bigger than the cat and will be immune for a short period of time.

The cat tries to catch the mouse by building a trap around it. To do so, the player controlling the cat has to move the cat around the mouse while pressing the "action" button. The cat has a limited amount of trap parts to use and the used ones can be picked up again by being walked over.

The game has 7 skill levels (with less trap parts for the mouse and both cat and mouse moving faster the higher the level is) and 8 possible variations (with stationary and moving cheese and obstacles for the mouse).</desc>

	<name>Nightmare</name>
	<desc>In Nightmare the player controls a visitor to a haunted mansion. The goal is to escape from it through a constantly moving hatch in the attic. His job will be made harder by the ghosts who are still lingering around the house. The player has to climb three floors to reach the attic, and there is one ghost for each floor.

The ghosts become invisible as they cross the house's walls. While invisible they are harmless, so they have to make themselves visible to catch the visitor. They'll become invisible again if they cross the house walls again. If they catch the visitor, he'll lose one of his lives. But once the visitor has past the ghost's floor, the ghost will be paralyzed and can be caught by the visitor.

Besides the ghosts, other dangers threaten the visitor. A thunderstorm is breaking out and flashes of lightning hit the mansion, creating lightning balls which will roll through the floor the visitor is in. The flashes will also make the invisible ghosts visible while the lightnings strike. Besides, the visitor can't be standing still for too long or a trap door will open and he'll fall through it, losing a life. To make things even more difficult, there will be also a randomly placed obstacle blocking the visitor's way.

The player starts with three lives and gains one each time he escapes the mansion. As the player grows on points from reaching the attic or capturing the ghosts, the game gets more difficult. The number of obstacles increase and the exit becomes invisible unless the player captures a ghost. In higher difficulty levels catching a ghost won't be enough, as the player will have to also get the house's ground plan, which appears on a chest after he captures a ghost.

The game can be played by 2 players, one of them controlling the ghosts in the house.</desc>

	<desc>Three games are available in this compilation:

1. Pairs (selected by pressing "1") is the same game as Matchmaker!, a regular Memory game. A matrix with 20 letters appears on the screen and the player has to find pairs of symbols hidden by the letters. Two counters will be displayed: time and number of matches. In two players mode (selected by pressing "2"), the players share the matrix and the one who makes more matches win.

2. Space Rendezvous (selected by pressing "3") is somewhat similar to Lunar Lander. Two players have to try to link up their spaceships to the orbiting mother ship, while avoiding hitting the ground. Each ship has 50 megajoules of power and will be refueled when a perfect link-up is performed. A counter will be displayed for each player, and wins the player who first performs 10 perfect link-ups. If one player goes out of fuel, he's out of game.

3. Logic (selected by pressing "4") is the same game as Logix!. The player has to guess a sequence of five different digits. The player types in the first try and the computer will display a two digit number with the number of correct digits to the right and the number of correctly placed digits on the left. The player has then to continue guessing the sequence based on the clues given. The object is to solve the problem in the least number of tries, counted on the left on the screen.</desc>

	<desc>The player has arrived at Vulcan Rock, an artificial planetoid defended by a laser-eyed space serpent and other minions of the evil Extra-Terrestrial Alliance. Now he must defend himself from them, as well as the volcano itself.

Controlling his spaceship with the control stick and shooting laser blasts with the action button, the player must avoid falling lava, rocks, the serpent's laser rays. Shooting the serpent will stun it, and shooting the rocks will destroy them. If the ship goes out of screen by one of its sides, it will come back in the opposite side.

From times to times, Gryptogg, Raygoth and Arkus of the Extra-Terrestrial Alliance will open doors in the volcano firing a gravitational ray, which will drag the player's ship to it. The higher the score, the stronger the ray will be. It can be stopped by blasting the door with laser.

The player earns 3 points for blasting lava during volcanic eruption, 15 points for stunning the space serpent, 45 points for hitting an open door, 75 points for destroying a lava rock and 1000 points for surviving a volcanic eruption.</desc>

The Eskimo starts standing on a small island in the middle of the river. He must kill the sharks in the water by throwing harpoons at them. He can swim to the banks or to ice floes above and below the island. The sharks can eat the ice floes so it isn't safe for the Eskimo to stand on them for much time, or else he'll be eaten too.

The fish are held by six rows of nets. The sharks will eat those nets to get the fish, and if an entire row is destroyed, more sharks will come from the sea. The Eskimo can repair the nets by swimming to the place where they were destroyed. The more nets destroyed, the less fish is kept. A stage will end when all sharks are killed. At the end of each stage the remaining fish will be counted and added to the player's score. As the game progresses, sharks become more abundant and destroy the nets faster. The game ends when the Eskimo gets eaten by a shark.</desc>

Additionally, when a fruit is eaten a magic barrier will appear, in the same direction in which the bee is flying, and it also must avoid crashing on them.

The player earns points by gathering fruits as follows:

1. Lemon (yellow): 5 points

3. Pear (green): 15 points
4. Plum (grey): 20 points
5. Strawberry (red): 25 points

You're a chopper pilot on a surveillance mission in enemy territory; your goal is to make it through the various obstacle courses alive and score as many points as possible. Tall buildings, mountains, narrow tunnels, and various enemies (such as tanks, rockets, mines, and more) can all get in the way and destroy your chopper if you aren't careful. To help defend yourself, the chopper is armed with a machine gun and bombs which can be used to destroy the enemy tanks and rockets. To make the task more difficult, your chopper has a limited amount of fuel. Throughout the landscapes are fuel tanks; if one of these is shot or bombed, you will be awarded extra fuel.

	<name>Turtles</name>
	<desc>Turtles, also known as Turpin, puts you into the role of the maternalistic turtle who tries to save the kidturtles from a bunch of bad bugs (or, in some versions, bad cars). It takes place in a Pacman-esque labyrinth, with turtle boxes in the centre and corners of the screen. Run into a box to release the turtle kid inside. Opening a box makes a little house show up, and you must go with the kidturtle to the house before you can release the next one. All the while, you must avoid the bugs/cars running around the maze. If they get too close, you can release a mine which will stun them temporarily. When you run out of mines, you must resupply by passing over a star in the centre of the screen. Beware, though, because the simpleminded bugs become smarter as time passes; this is symbolised by their changing colours. On later levels, those sneaky beetles can also come out of the boxes supposed to hold kidturtles. Watch out!

Each level is a floor in a house, and between levels you can see the turtle climbing to the next floor until it reaches the top.</desc>

	<name>UFO!</name>
	<desc>Description

Commanding of one of Earth Federation's robot-controlled battle cruisers, the player must protect Earth from an invasion of unidentified flying objects.

The ship is equipped with a laser cannon and a force field. The force field energy is drained when the ship's lasers are fired (by pressing the action button). The direction of the lasers is shown by a white dot in the force field, which rotates to aim in the direction the ship is moving.

There are three types of UFO's. The first one drifts randomly in space. The second, the Hunter-Killer, can detect the player's spaceship, linking with another one of the same type when it happens. The third one is a Light-speed Starship armed with computer-guided missiles.

The UFO's can be destroyed by laser blasts or by entering in touch with the force field in the player's ship. If the later happens, the force field energy is also drained.

The ship travels at half-speed when its force field is recharging. It goes from black (when depleted) to blue (when fully charged). The ship is vulnerable until the force field is completely recharged.

The player will earn 1 point for each random drifter destroyed, 3 points for each Hunter-Killer and 10 points for each Light-speed Starship.</desc>

	<desc>This is a Space Invaders variant with a twist. Eight robots with laser cannons and protected by a shield wall are advancing in the player's sector, and with his laser cannon he has to destroy them. The shield wall is indestructible, but the robots and the cannons aren't. They'll go from side to side of the screen in an alternate movement shooting down. Three high density molecular laser shields are placed in defense of the laser cannon. Each one of them houses an extra cannon.

Instead of a passing flying saucer as seen in Space Invaders, the player has to face the Merciless Monstroth, which shoots against him. The player controls a robot defender inside the laser cannon. If the laser cannon is destroyed, the robot will be left unprotected. The robot can enter in a new laser cannon housed in one of the shields. Once the new laser cannon is active, the shield is gone. Once the three shields are gone, the Merciless Monstroth will come down to hunt the player's cannon and robot.

The player wins a battle when destroying all enemy robots and cannons on the screen. A battle is lost when the player's robot is destroyed. The first side to win ten battles wins the war.</desc>

	<name>The Blobbers</name>
	<desc>In Blobbers the player controls a mobile laser unit trying to defend itself from the Blobbers, fearsome, giant, amoeba-like creatures that will devour anything they encounter. The mobile laser unit moves grounded to the sides of the screen area. The Blobbers will also move along the same sides, and as the laser gun can only shoot straight forward, the mobile laser unit has to be in the opposite side of the screen to hit the Blobbers.

A Blobber borns as a harmless small yellow spot, growing to a bigger and purple mass, to a bigger and white one until it reaches its red adult form. Only when it is red it can do harm to the mobile laser unit, if they are of any other color, they will only stick to the mobile laser unit until it moves and releases itself from the Blobber. As the time passes, an adult Blobber will multiply, releasing a new small yellow spot which will eventually grow into another adult Blobber. When Blobbers are hit, they are reduced to the immediate previous stage of development (from red to white, then purple, then yellow, then deceased).

In the middle of the screen, moving blocks called Magic Transporters move up and down randomly. They are called Magic Transporters because they can be used to transport the mobile laser unit from one side of the screen to the other, if the mobile laser unit moves onto one of them while they touch the top or bottom of the screen. The Blobbers will also be transported by them. Also, they are impenetrable by the laser gun, meaning the player will only be able to hit one Blobber when there are no Magic Transporters in the laser's way.

The Blobbers will become faster every 90 seconds until finally reaching the mobile laser unit's speed. The player has only one life and no continues.</desc>

If one or more numbers are parked in one of the points, the player can only additionally move to that point numbers which are lower than the last one already parked. The numbers can be moved one by one only and to do so the player has to type the letter of origin and then type the destiny letter. Moves can be undone by pressing the "clear" key.

The computer keeps track of the time elapsed and the number of moves made by the player, also showing the minimum amount of moves to solve the puzzle. There are 9 other possible variations, with the difference of having the way to point D blocked and different amounts of numbers to move. Those variations can be selected by pressing "reset" and the desired number, as follows:one figure - minimum number of moves: 1

	<path>./Conquest of the World (USA, Europe).bin</path>
	<name>Conquest of the World</name>
	<desc>Players choose to play as one of 43 countries and make it their homeland. Each country's military and diplomacy power is reflected by its real life counterpart during the early 1980's. Each country's relationship with one another is also reflected by how it is in real life.

Gameplay involves the use of a gameboard. Gameplay done on the game board contains information which is then entered into the Odyssey 2 for it to handle. Inside the game itself, players do battle by land, air, and sea. Battles involve players controlling either a jet (air force), tank (army), or a submarine (navy) and then battling the other players jet, tank, or submarine. These vehicles are dependent on supplies which are displayed as energy units. Every shot fired and movement made drains the players energy units. The battle ends when all the energy units run out. These combat results are then recorded on the gameboard, which then spurs further entries into the Odyssey 2.

Every battle won and alliance made will increase a country's power. The country with the most power at the end of the game wins.

Besides the gameboard map itself, the game also comes with a 100 power base unit indicators, a Homeland Marker, and six sets of Conquest/Alliance markers.</desc>

	<name>Cosmic Conflict!</name>
	<desc>The player is a legendary hero of the Earth Federation, in command of a Centurion star fighter and must defend the galaxy from the Imperial ships attack.

From a first person perspective, the player must destroy fifteen enemy ships. A counter at the lower left corner of the screen shows how many ships are left. On the lower right, a counter marking, at the start of the mission, 1000 megajoules of remaining ship power. The ship needs one megajoule per second to sustain flight, ten megajoules per laser shot released and fifty megajoules per shot taken, to activate the deflector shields.

Three kinds of ships will assault the player's ship: invasion transports, battle frigates, and star fighters. The enemy fleet consists of five star fighters and ten ships randomly distributed among the remaining two kinds. Only star fighters represent a real threat, a general alert will sound and flash at the screen when one of those enter the player's range of sight.

The mission ends when all enemy ships are destroyed or when all the ship's fuel is used.</desc>

	<name>Depth Charge + Marksman</name>
	<desc>Two titles are available in this cart:

1. Depth Charge is a single-player BattleShip variant. The player controls a cannon in a top-down view trying to destroy 7 submarines hidden in the area of water shown on screen. The area is a 8x8 grid, and the player controls a white cross-hair over it with the joystick. Pressing the action button will shoot the cannon. If a submarine is hidden in that particular area, a blue square will appear, marking it. If there are no submarines, the game will warn the player with a sound and that area will continue unmarked. There are submarines of 4 different sizes, with there being 3 with one section each, 2 with 2 sections each, 1 with 3 sections and 1 with 4 sections. The game keeps track of the number of shots tried by the player, and the total is shown at the end of the game, when all submarines are destroyed.

2. Marksman is a shooting gallery game. The player can choose between 2 game durations: 1 minute or 3 minutes. The game is played in a first person perspective, with the player seeing the rifle and the targets in front of it. A line of targets will scroll from right to left, bouncing up and down in front of the rifle and the player has to aim at them and shoot. There are 9 different targets which grant the player scores from 1 to 9 points each. When the player reaches 100 points, the targets start to move faster. The game ends when the time reaches 0:00 or when the player runs out of shots (starting with 24).</desc>

A Labyrinth Game is exactly what the title defines. The player has to move a pawn from the left side of a labyrinth to the exit on the right side. Each match consists in a series of 10 and the labyrinth always changes when starting a new game. The pawn is controlled with the joystick and the "action" makes it move faster. There are 16 possible variations, including stationary and moving patterns and exits, for one player, two players or one player against the computer (a "Cat and Mouse" game where the computer plays a pawn which tries to catch the player's pawn).

Supermind is a code breaking game. Four question marks will be displayed, along with the number of symbols left to be entered (4 at the start). The player enters four symbols of choice and if they're correct but misplaced, a red number will appear in the right of the screen (with the number of correct symbols guessed). If the symbol is correct and placed in the right order, it will be displayed in white. The computer keeps track of the number of tries taken and the game ends when all symbols were discovered and placed in the right order.</desc>

	<name>Las Vegas Blackjack!</name>
	<desc>One or two players can play against the computer in this Blackjack game.

Each player starts with $1000. After placing their bets (through the keyboard), the dealer shuffles the cards and deals two face-up cards for each player and one face-up card and one face-down card to himself. He then asks the players to hit more cards or not (up to five). After each player has been dealt a full hand, the dealer reveals his face-down card. He'll take a hit if he has a total of 16 or less.

Blackjack or five cards without a bust pays double. The nearest to 21 hands pays even. No money is paid if there is a tie.

The computer offers an insurance bet if the dealer's first card is an ace. If the player accepts and the dealer goes blackjack, the player will lose no money. Otherwise, he will win or lose the current bet plus a half.

Sometimes the computer will also offer a double down. If the player accepts, the bet is doubled and he will get just one more card.</desc>

There are four kinds of amusements: a rocking horse, a slide, a roundabout and trees. The boy will also find threats to his balloon along the way, like birds that will cross the screen from left to right, trying to burst it, and sudden gusts of wind, which will take the balloon out from the boy's grasp if he stands still for too long.

The boy can release the balloon at any time and grab it again by its string (by pressing the action button). If the balloon hits a wall, it will burst and the game is over. The longer the game is played, the quicker the balloon rises if released.

The player scores:

1. 2 points by catching the balloon;
2. 5 points by playing at a tree;
3. 7 points by playing at the rocking horse;
4. 8 points by evading a bird;
5. 10 points by playing at the slide;
6. 12 points by playing at the roundabout;
7. 25 points by leaving the playground.

There are 10 difficulty levels. From levels 0 to 4, the playground layout is fixed. From levels 5 to 9, the walls in the playground will appear, disappear and change places.</desc>

	<desc>Martians are attacking the Earth and planning to destroy all life in it. A Martian space ship is orbiting the earth and a big laser cannon is being built on Earth and it is the player's mission to hold the Martian threat until the laser cannon is complete. To do so, the SIDO (Space Intruder Defense Organisation) infiltrated a fighting probe inside the Martian spaceship.

In Martian Threat the player controls a fighting probe with the joystick. The lack of gravity will make the probe keep moving until reverse thrust is given. The player has to shoot Martians and their energy bombs, which will appear in four different spots. The probe can only shoot diagonally. At the start, the Martian bombs are green and have little energy on them. As the game proceeds the bombs turn blue, purple and finally red. The probe can take up to ten hits from green bombs, but only three hits from red bombs. Additionally, the bombs will move faster and when they hit the probe they'll push it away. The probe explodes if it hits the space ship's walls.

The game has two possible endings. If the player succeeds in defending the Earth for 64 seconds (77 seconds in PAL systems), the laser defense will be finished and Earth will be saved. If the probe gets destroyed before that, the Martians will release their virus bomb and destroy all life on Earth.</desc>

	<path>./Mission Impossible + Programmed Trip (Brazil) (Proto).bin</path>
	<name>Mission Impossible / Programmed Trip</name>
	<desc>Two titles are available in this cart:

Mission Impossible is an action game. The player must protect a cargo ship (white craft) which travels on a lay lines from bounty hunters (red crafts), which will destroy the cargo ship if they cross its way. As the cargo ship moves along the lay lines, the player must place NGR bots (green X symbols) at the lay line intersections to change traffic; the player has 7 NGR bots and can replace them. When any ships reaches an NGR bot, it will turn right if traveling vertically or turn toward the bottom of the screen when traveling horizontally. Red mushroom-shaped power ups, when picked up allow the cargo ship to destroy the bounty hunters; alternatively, bounty hunters can be simply directed to them and will be destroyed. White X marks will send the cargo ship back in the opposite way it was traveling; if hit by a bounty hunter, they will also send them back, but will be destroyed. Lilac squares are mines which will destroy any ship that passes over them. Finally, blue dots will give bounty hunters an extra life if taken by them. The player and the bounty hunters start with 15 lives each, the first to drop to zero loses.

Programmed Trip is a turn based game which shares many elements from the previous game. As the name implies, the player has to program the trip of the cargo field so it passes over pickup points (colored + symbols) in a specific order: first lilac, then red, then blue. To do so, NGR bots can be placed to redirect the ship, and some fields may also have White X marks already placed. After all desired NGR bots are placed, the player can release the cargo ship by placing the cursor over the upper left corner and pressing the action button. When the cargo ship is released the player has 30 points. Passing over pickup points in the correct order adds 20 points to the score, while passing over them in the wrong order or hitting any other item (NGR bots or white X marks, for instance) subtracts 10 points from the score. The game is over either when the score reaches 0 or when all pickup points were reached in the right order (in which case they'll turn white).</desc>

	<desc>Morse teaches the code to players. There are 4 types of games which can be selected in a menu screen:The first type is a Morse code learning game. The player selects the game speed (4 to 30 words per minute) and level (1 to all 36 characters available). The computer will play the Morse signal for the first symbol (Q) and the player has to type in the symbol. After learning two signals, the game starts properly by introducing a row of trees in the top of the screen. An arrow is also displayed near the 4th tree from the left and a man on the right side. For each 10 correctly responded symbols the man takes down one tree. When he reaches the arrow, a new symbol is introduced and the process starts over again. The sequence of symbols is: Q, 7, Z, G, 0, 9, 8, O, 1, J, P, W, L, R, A, M, 6, B, X, D, Y, C, K, N, 2, 3, F, U, 4, 5, V, H, S, I, T and E.

2. The second type lets the player type individual symbols and listen to their respective codes.

3. The third type is similar to the second one, but in this one the player types a sequence of symbols and then press "enter" to ask the computer to play the respective code.

4. In the fourth type the player uses the "action" button of the joystick to enter codes into and the computer plays them and shows the respective symbol entered.</desc>

	<desc>The Mousing Cat is another game about the eternal conflict between felines and rodents. The game consists in a series of six encounters in which the players alternate the roles of cat and mouse (three times each). The winner is the player with most points at the end of the series.

The only player to score is the mouse. He does so by eating the cheese pieces scattered through the room. To eat, the player controlling the mouse has to press and hold the "action" button. The longer the button stay pressed, the more it eats. If the mouse eats for a certain amount of time, it will grow bigger than the cat and will be immune for a short period of time.

The cat tries to catch the mouse by building a trap around it. To do so, the player controlling the cat has to move the cat around the mouse while pressing the "action" button. The cat has a limited amount of trap parts to use and the used ones can be picked up again by being walked over.

The game has 7 skill levels (with less trap parts for the mouse and both cat and mouse moving faster the higher the level is) and 8 possible variations (with stationary and moving cheese and obstacles for the mouse).</desc>

	<name>Nightmare</name>
	<desc>In Nightmare the player controls a visitor to a haunted mansion. The goal is to escape from it through a constantly moving hatch in the attic. His job will be made harder by the ghosts who are still lingering around the house. The player has to climb three floors to reach the attic, and there is one ghost for each floor.

The ghosts become invisible as they cross the house's walls. While invisible they are harmless, so they have to make themselves visible to catch the visitor. They'll become invisible again if they cross the house walls again. If they catch the visitor, he'll lose one of his lives. But once the visitor has past the ghost's floor, the ghost will be paralyzed and can be caught by the visitor.

Besides the ghosts, other dangers threaten the visitor. A thunderstorm is breaking out and flashes of lightning hit the mansion, creating lightning balls which will roll through the floor the visitor is in. The flashes will also make the invisible ghosts visible while the lightnings strike. Besides, the visitor can't be standing still for too long or a trap door will open and he'll fall through it, losing a life. To make things even more difficult, there will be also a randomly placed obstacle blocking the visitor's way.

The player starts with three lives and gains one each time he escapes the mansion. As the player grows on points from reaching the attic or capturing the ghosts, the game gets more difficult. The number of obstacles increase and the exit becomes invisible unless the player captures a ghost. In higher difficulty levels catching a ghost won't be enough, as the player will have to also get the house's ground plan, which appears on a chest after he captures a ghost.

The game can be played by 2 players, one of them controlling the ghosts in the house.</desc>

1. Pairs (selected by pressing "1") is the same game as Matchmaker!, a regular Memory game.

In two players mode (selected by pressing "2"), the players share the matrix and the one who makes more matches win.

2. Space Rendezvous (selected by pressing "3") is somewhat similar to Lunar Lander. Two players have to try to link up their spaceships to the orbiting mother ship, while avoiding hitting the ground. Each ship has 50 megajoules of power and will be refueled when a perfect link-up is performed. A counter will be displayed for each player, and wins the player who first performs 10 perfect link-ups. If one player goes out of fuel, he's out of game.

3. Logic (selected by pressing "4") is the same game as Logix!. The player has to guess a sequence of five different digits. The player types in the first try and the computer will display a two digit number with the number of correct digits to the right and the number of correctly placed digits on the left. The player has then to continue guessing the sequence based on the clues given. The object is to solve the problem in the least number of tries, counted on the left on the screen.</desc>

The player earns 3 points for blasting lava during volcanic eruption, 15 points for stunning the space serpent, 45 points for hitting an open door, 75 points for destroying a lava rock and 1000 points for surviving a volcanic eruption.</desc>

	<name>Secret of the Pharaohs</name>
	<desc>Secret of the Pharaohs is a puzzle game for two players. Each player has to find the correct position of stones in the Pharaoh's pyramids. The screen is horizontally divided in the half, and the pyramids have four blocks in the lower layer (or higher for the top player), three in the middle and one at the top (or bottom for the top player). Each block has two possible positions for placing the stones, and after the players place them, a number will appear above (for the up player) or below (for the down player), showing how many of them are correctly placed. Players must then relocate the stones until all of them are placed correctly. When it is done, the higher (or lower) layer of blocks will be liberated. The player who first places all the stones correctly in all the layers wins.</desc>

	<name>Shark Hunter</name>
	<desc>In Shark Hunter the player controls an Eskimo protecting fish stocks from the attack of sharks.

The Eskimo starts standing on a small island in the middle of the river. He must kill the sharks in the water by throwing harpoons at them. He can swim to the banks or to ice floes above and below the island. The sharks can eat the ice floes so it isn't safe for the Eskimo to stand on them for much time, or else he'll be eaten too.

The fish are held by six rows of nets. The sharks will eat those nets to get the fish, and if an entire row is destroyed, more sharks will come from the sea. The Eskimo can repair the nets by swimming to the place where they were destroyed. The more nets destroyed, the less fish is kept. A stage will end when all sharks are killed. At the end of each stage the remaining fish will be counted and added to the player's score. As the game progresses, sharks become more abundant and destroy the nets faster. The game ends when the Eskimo gets eaten by a shark.</desc>

Each player has to hit his opponent ten times in order to win. At each hit, both players get their guns reloaded. They can also reload their guns anytime by taking the hidden bullets in the tree that matches their outfit.

The bullets will ricochet in the trees and the top and bottom edges of the screen, thus the players can hit themselves with their own bullets, scoring a hit to the opponent. It can also be used as a strategy to hit the opponent in a non direct trajectory.</desc>

Use your web to climb the building, but be careful of Green Goblin's villians which appear in the windows trying to stop you. If your web line goes too close to a villian, it will be cut and Spider-Man will fall. If you're careful, you can swing back and forth to capture the villians for bonus points. When you reach the top of the building, it's time to climb up the high voltage tower which is booby trapped with bombs. The bombs can be defused or avoided to get to the top, but just make sure you aren't too close to one that explodes! Once you arrive at the top of the tower, Green Goblin himself will be protecting the super bomb he has planted there. If you can sneak past Green Goblin and defuse the super bomb, the level is complete and you then move on to the next, more challenging level.</desc>

	<desc>In Super Bee the player controls a bee flying in a magic garden, where fruits keep popping everywhere. The fruits must be eaten (by flying over them), while avoiding to crash in the garden's fences (the edges of the screen). Additionally, when a fruit is eaten a magic barrier will appear, in the same direction in which the bee is flying, and it also must avoid crashing on them.

The player earns points by gathering fruits as follows:

1. Lemon (yellow): 5 points
2. Apple (red): 10 points
3. Pear (green): 15 points
4. Plum (grey): 20 points
5. Strawberry (red): 25 points

When the player reaches 105 points a bonus round takes place. A big spider appears in the screen, along with a fruit, for a limited time. Super Bee must avoid the spider and eat the fruit. By doing so the player earns 50 points. The next bonus rounds take place every 15 more points.

There are 10 skill levels available (by pressing 0 to 9), each one with different mazes.</desc>

Tall buildings, mountains, narrow tunnels, and various enemies (such as tanks, rockets, mines, and more) can all get in the way and destroy your chopper if you aren't careful. To help defend yourself, the chopper is armed with a machine gun and bombs which can be used to destroy the enemy tanks and rockets. To make the task more difficult, your chopper has a limited amount of fuel. Throughout the landscapes are fuel tanks; if one of these is shot or bombed, you will be awarded extra fuel. As the levels progress, the enemies become more aggressive, fuel becomes more scarce, and the landscape becomes trickier to navigate.</desc>

	<desc>Turtles, also known as Turpin, puts you into the role of the maternalistic turtle who tries to save the kidturtles from a bunch of bad bugs (or, in some versions, bad cars). It takes place in a Pacman-esque labyrinth, with turtle boxes in the centre and corners of the screen. Run into a box to release the turtle kid inside. Opening a box makes a little house show up, and you must go with the kidturtle to the house before you can release the next one. All the while, you must avoid the bugs/cars running around the maze. If they get too close, you can release a mine which will stun them temporarily. When you run out of mines, you must resupply by passing over a star in the centre of the screen. Beware, though, because the simpleminded bugs become smarter as time passes; this is symbolised by their changing colours. On later levels, those sneaky beetles can also come out of the boxes supposed to hold kidturtles. Watch out!

Each level is a floor in a house, and between levels you can see the turtle climbing to the next floor until it reaches the top.</desc>

	<name>UFO!</name>
	<desc>Description

Commanding of one of Earth Federation's robot-controlled battle cruisers, the player must protect Earth from an invasion of unidentified flying objects.

The ship is equipped with a laser cannon and a force field. The force field energy is drained when the ship's lasers are fired (by pressing the action button). The direction of the lasers is shown by a white dot in the force field, which rotates to aim in the direction the ship is moving.

There are three types of UFO's. The first one drifts randomly in space. The second, the Hunter-Killer, can detect the player's spaceship, linking with another one of the same type when it happens. The third one is a Light-speed Starship armed with computer-guided missiles.

The UFO's can be destroyed by laser blasts or by entering in touch with the force field in the player's ship. If the later happens, the force field energy is also drained.

The ship travels at half-speed when its force field is recharging. It goes from black (when depleted) to blue (when fully charged). The ship is vulnerable until the force field is completely recharged.

The player will earn 1 point for each random drifter destroyed, 3 points for each Hunter-Killer and 10 points for each Light-speed Starship.</desc>
