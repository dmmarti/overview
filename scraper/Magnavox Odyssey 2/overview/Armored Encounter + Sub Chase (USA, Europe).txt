War is hell, but this Multi-Mode cartridge makes it fun.  
Armored Encounter! is a clone of Atari's Tank (AKA Combat). Two player-controlled tanks shoot at each other across a wide play field. Variations allow for different field layouts, land mines, and guided missiles. 
In Sub Chase! players control an airplane and a submarine that scroll horizontally across the screen. Players score points for shooting the other, but lose points if a stray shot strikes one of two neutral vessels in the middle of the screen. In both games, the player who scores highest after three minutes wins.
