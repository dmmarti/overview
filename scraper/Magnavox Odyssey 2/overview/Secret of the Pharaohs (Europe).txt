Secret of the Pharaohs is a puzzle game for two players. Each player has to find the correct position of stones in the Pharaoh's pyramids. The screen is horizontally divided in the half, and the pyramids have four blocks in the lower layer (or higher for the top player), three in the middle and one at the top (or bottom for the top player). Each block has two possible positions for placing the stones, and after the players place them, a number will appear above (for the up player) or below (for the down player), showing how many of them are correctly placed. Players must then relocate the stones until all of them are placed correctly. When it is done, the higher (or lower) layer of blocks will be liberated. The player who first places all the stones correctly in all the layers wins.
