Sega makes the one of the best baseball arcade systems ever with the 1999 version of the classic World Series Baseball. Everything that is needed in a good arcade is here, it's quick, easy to learn, and most of all you get your money's worth when you play. The game is pretty basic with a normal game mode that can be played 1 on 1 or 1 vs. comp. For your first credit you get 3 innings of offence and defence and from there can put in more money to continue.
