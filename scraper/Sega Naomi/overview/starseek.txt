Idol Star Seeker is a minesweeper-style arcade game played on a field of hexagonal tiles. The objective is to mark all of the mines and remove all of the tiles within the time limit to reveal an image of a scantily clad girl. Every stage features a new background image to reveal, but if the stage is not completed in a timely manner the image changes to that of the sulking fully clothed model but the player still has a chance to complete the stage and continue the game. However if the timer runs completely out, then it is game over.
