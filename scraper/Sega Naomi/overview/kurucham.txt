Two players take opposite corners of a rectangular playing field consisting of hexagonal tiles of various colors. Each player is in control of one set of tiles which all have the same color and all touch on at least one side. On each turn, the player chooses one of the remaining colors, which turns their current set of tiles into that color and adds all adjacent tiles of that color to their set. The first player to have a majority of the field's tiles in their control wins.
