Guilty Gear XX #Reload is a 2003 fighting game by Sammy and Arc System Works in Arc System Works's Guilty Gear series of fighting games. Sega brought it to the PlayStation Portable in Japan in 2005.    In addition, PlayStation 2, Xbox, and PC versions were also released, but by Sammy (JP/US) and Zoo Digital Publishing (EU), sometimes renamed Guilty Gear X2 #Reload. The Japanese Xbox version uses Sega's "Violent Actions are Included in the Soft" icon. Later releases of the Japanese PS2 version were published by Sega, but neither Sega nor Sony mark when this happened.
