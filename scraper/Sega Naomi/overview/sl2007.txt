Shooting Love 2007 is a compilation of two shooters:    Exzeal:  Exzeal follows the similar formula to "Trizeal" in which players progress through the stages and destroy the bosses respectively. However, the weapon power-up system from Trizeal was removed, replaced by the special fixed-weapon system, with a standard attack and a charged attack that can destroy single large enemies once. The player can choose from one of the four weapon sets during the start, with one mimicking the attack pattern of "XII Stag".    Shmups Skill Test:  A collection of competitive mini-games for shooter fans. A player's proficiency is measured at the end of each mini-game, with both 'Score' and 'Result' displayed, and there are 3 modes in proficiency measurement.
