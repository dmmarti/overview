Virtua Striker 2 is a football game. Players compete as 1 of 32 international teams, detailed down to the members' uniforms and playing styles. As the most dedicated soccer fanatic expects, the gameplay is highly detailed and the action is fast and furious. The realistic, motion-captured players perform a plethora of stylish moves, including bicycle kicks, headers, and slide tackles. One cool feature: as the virtual clock ticks away the hours from morning through evening, the environmental lighting adjusts accordingly. Of course, a social game like soccer is twice as fun with a fellow Pel√© wannabe, which is why there's a head-to-head two-person multiplayer mode.
