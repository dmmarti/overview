The Maze of the Kings is a great fighting / shooting game, where players assume the roles of archaeological treasure hunters armed with magical canes! Travels across rivers and deserts and explore the insides of pyramids, while searching for lost treasure and killing mummies and other evil creatures along the way. Players can choose what type of firepower to use for their magical canes: Light, Spark, or Fire.
