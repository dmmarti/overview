This game is the second entry in the Rival Schools series. The fighting system has evolved from the previous episodes. It's still a tag-team fighting game, but the teams now have 3 characters instead of 2. There's still the possibility to do a duo attack, but it's now possible to do a powerful "Party-Up" attack by pressing the 3 attack buttons at once.
