Akatsuki Blitzkampf Ausf Achse is based upon the original Akatsuki Blitzkampf Japanese PC d?jin 2D fighting game from SUBTLE STYLE which was originally released on the 30th April 2007.  The original PC game got a lot of attention in Japan for its high-resolution sprites and older style gameplay similar to that of the older Samurai Showdown in the way that you can parry.  This Naomi arcade release features improved graphics as well as an extra character going under the name of Perfect.
