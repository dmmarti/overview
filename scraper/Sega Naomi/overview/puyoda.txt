Arle Nadja and her friends take some time off from Puyo fighting and challenge players to dance with them. The game features several dance stages similar to those of Dance Dance Revolution. It also introduces a new ELLENA system used to render the game as well as a new exclusive character featuring the same name (Ellena Stevens, the protagonist of the original Broadway Legend Ellena). One or two players can dance to a variety of J-pop tunes by using the controller buttons to copy their opponent's moves. Based on how well a player copies the moves, Nuisance Puyos are sent to their opponent. The player not having Nuisance Puyos on their side of the screen when the song is over wins the stage.
