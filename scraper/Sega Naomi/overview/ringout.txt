A game for up to four players at once. Choose from one of eight mutated super-vehicles. The object of the game is not to race, but to be the last one standing.Knock all of the other opponents out of the inner circle, using tactics and items which are littered across the arena. These include Long Bumpers, Sonic Bumpers, Speed Ups, Ball Bumpers and Gigantic Icons, which can all offer advantages to those who pick them up.
