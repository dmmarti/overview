Trizeal is a vertical shoot'em up. Your spacecraft can be morphed into 3 models supporting different shooting types, including front missiles, homing rockets and wide shot. You will operate your ship with 3 action buttons: shoot, morph and bomb. A power up system allows you to boost your ship into 5 different levels.
