Become a funky gymnastic back flipping, somersaulting, wall climbing virtual reality squash player. Travel by a virtual express train to an interstellar cosmic recreation room and smash the blocks.    Break all the blocks in the stage within the time limit, then the player can run to the next stage. There are 50 stages in this game, with many different routes to the final stage. Using a trick smash (there are 28 patterns) increases the destructive power of the ball, allowing the player to complete the stage faster. The penalty for using trick smash is a faster decrease in remaining time. There are normal blocks, unbreakable blocks, bonus blocks and various sizes of blocks moving in various patterns. The ball will also rebound differently from different blocks.
