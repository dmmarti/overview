In Psyvariar 2, one player controls one of two mech fighters through five vertically scrolling stages, each of which contains a number of enemies and finishes with a boss. To defeat them, the player can use a regular rapid-fire shot, a more concentrated "rolling shot", or a limited supply of screen-clearing bombs. At the beginning of the game the player can choose between two characters, Kei and Yuhei. Kei plays in a more traditional manner, using a wide shot and normal bomb, while Yuhei has a narrow shot and a bomb which increases the player's Buzz radius.
