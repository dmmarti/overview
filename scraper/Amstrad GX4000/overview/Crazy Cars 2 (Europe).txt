You're in a Ferrari F40 and are trying to smash a racket which is being run by some corrupt policemen. You have to race your car around four American states – Utah, Colorado, Arizona and New Mexico – and reach several destinations within the time limit. The police are on the loose, though! This game is much better than the original Crazy Cars, with excellent graphics and great Doppler effects when you're approaching police cars. There's also some really groovy digitised music to listen to on the title screen if you're playing the disc version of the game! The noise of your engine is OK, too, and it's a nice game with a lot of map-reading required
