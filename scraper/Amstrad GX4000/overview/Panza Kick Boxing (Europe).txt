The press is unanimous: the best simulation to date! Two years work were barely sufficient to digitize all the blows, falls, foils and to recreate more than 120 combat positions. Produced with the exceptional assistance of Andre Panza, three times world Kick Boxing champion and three times European French boxing champion, this incredible simulation will bring you into the boxing world at the very highest level."
