More hostages have been kidnapped, but this time they're being held deep in the African jungle. Firstly, you have to travel to the enemy's ammunition depot before going to the hideout where the hostages are being kept. Next, you must get into your boat and sail to the enemy HQ, where the final confrontation awaits. The game features a novel restarting system, where the number of continues you get depends on how well you're doing, although I'm not sure this is entirely a good thing. It is a difficult game with more enemies on the screen at once, and worse, you can't see who you're firing at! The scrolling isn't very good either, and the graphics on the normal CPC version are horrible at times
