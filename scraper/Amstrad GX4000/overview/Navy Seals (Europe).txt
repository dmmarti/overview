A helicopter crew of Navy SEALs, an élite American commando unit, has been kidnapped in Beirut by terrorists. A group of five of their comrades has been sent out to infiltrate the terrorists' headquarters, rescue the hostages and destroy their stockpile of Stinger missiles. This is a platform game which involves brains as well as brawn. The terrorists are heavily armed, and one shot from them will kill you – so you have to sneak up on them, make sure they haven't seen you, then shoot them before they do the same to you. This game was only released on cartridge, but it uses the Plus' extra facilities to good effect and is well worth playing, although be warned that it is very difficult; if it was a bit easier, I would give it a higher rating.
