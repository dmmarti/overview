This is the game that every Plus owner has, because it comes free with the machine. It's an endurance race where you must stay on the track for as long as possible without running out of time, but first of all, you must qualify to settle your grid position. This game makes full use of the Plus' extra abilities and has some beautiful, crystal-clear music on the title screen. The sky even changes from day to night to show your progress! It's touches like these that make this game better than others like it.
