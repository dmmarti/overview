Jack Fremont was planning to enjoy his day doing the things he loved -- reading comics, ignoring the eviction notices, and heading down to the bar to play '70s television trivia. That was until CIA agents kidnapped him. As it turns out, there's a missile aimed at L.A. and the Russians are planning to hijack Hollywood. The agents make Jack an offer he can't refuse: $500 to save the world. Now he's wanted dead by a man named Frank and ends up fighting for his life.
