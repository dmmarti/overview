The maze displayed on the screen is divided into squares, and the aim of the game is for a Mazeman to collect these squares by passing through them. Each square is worth ten points.

However, also in the maze are found Hobgoblin monsters searching for the Mazeman to gobble him up.
This game is similar to Pac-man.
