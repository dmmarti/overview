Gekisou Sentai Carranger: Zenkai! Racer Senshi  Gekiso Sentai Karenja Zenkai! Resa Senshi?, Racing Squadron Carranger: Full Force! Racer Warrior) is the licensed video game of the Carranger series. It was released in Japan by Bandai in 1996, and required the Sufami Turbo accessory. Despite the fact that Carranger was adapted into Power Rangers: Turbo, the game was never brought to the North American market as such because, by the time Turbo premiered in 1997, the Nintendo 64 had been on North American shores for several months. The N64 had only just come out in Japan when the game was released, so not everyone had switched yet.
