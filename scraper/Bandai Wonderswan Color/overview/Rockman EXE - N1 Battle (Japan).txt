Taking place within the timeline of the Battle Network series, Rockman EXE N1 Battle involves a battling tournament called the "Battle Chip GP" among various pairs of online avatars called "NetNavis" and their human operators. Rather than directly control the player character through the traditional real-time tactical role-playing battles of the other Battle Network games, Rockman EXE N1 Battle tasks the player with creating a "Program Deck" made up of abilities called "Battle Chips". The game randomly selects chips for the player and executes them in a duel with a computer-controlled opponent.
