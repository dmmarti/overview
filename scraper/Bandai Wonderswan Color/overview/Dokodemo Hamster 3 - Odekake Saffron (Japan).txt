This is the third in Bandai's "hamster simulation" series. In this game, you are the "master" of a hamster. The game flows in real time, but you can interfere and perform various actions. The hamster has its own room in a house, with a table and a wheel. There are many things you can do with the hamster. You can take in to a stroll in the forest, go shopping with it, make it play with a ball, and so on. You can also perform actions unrelated to the hamster, like re-decorating the house or writing and painting on a piece of paper. The game features a point-and-click interface: you move your cursor over an object (such as hamster or calendar), which brings up an action menu.
