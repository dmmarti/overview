This remake of SaGa features several changes compared to the original. The graphics have been updated to 16-bit level, with new sprites and artwork drawn by Toshiyuki Itahana. New animated sequences have been added to the game as well as an intro sequence. Other new features include the ability to see what a monster would change to if they eat a new meat ahead of time, a bestiary, and the ability to re-target enemies when a previous target is slain by another character. There's even an option to play a straight port of the original Game Boy version as well.
