In the early 21st century, due to the global warming that has accelerated since the end of the previous century, several tens of percent of the earth's land was submerged. Many big cities were submerged in the sea, and the global economy was devastated.

The year is 2052. The world has established a new order centered on the two major camps, the Space Development Organization ?Jesus? and the International Civil Organization ?Green Frontier?. The two major organizations that were born as a result of repeated mergers by large corporations around the world will eventually become more tense over space development initiatives. And, with the surprise attack on the side of Jesus, the two camps finally enter the battle!

The player chooses and plays either pilot Kazuhito Moriguchi (boarding machine RUN = DIM) or Kanna Aso (boarding machine I = RA) belonging to the Green Frontier camp. The game consists of 6 stages.
