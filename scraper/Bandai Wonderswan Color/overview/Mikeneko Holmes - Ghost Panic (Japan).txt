Mikeneko Holmes: Ghost Panic is a mystery game based on popular Mikeneko Holmes novels by Akagawa Jir?, a Japanese mystery novel writer. The protagonist in this mystery story is none other than Holmes, the cat, not Sherlock, who got involved in a murder incident in an old castle somewhere in southern part of Germany, which is nowadays used as a sightseeing hotel. Ancient legends about witches, demons and strange phenomena are well known in the area, which adds a touch of supernatural to be feared of, if any of it true.

This game is made to play as a sound comic, meaning the artwork is made as an interactive comic book which progresses the story, yet allowing the player to enter choices which will take the story in a different direction and lead to one of several different endings.
