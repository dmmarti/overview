Kinnikuman Nisei: Ch?jin Seisenshi is an RPG game based in the Kinnikuman/Ultimate Muscle series, although the plot of the game bears no relation to any of the original series' sagas. Here you will take the role of an anonymous guy -created specially for this game- named "The Mask" (although you can change his name for one of your choice) and will have to defeat all the characters of the Kinnikuman universe that appear in your way.
