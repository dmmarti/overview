The plot of Digimon Battle Spirit 2 echoes that of its source series, Digimon Frontier; several children receive messages on their cell phones asking them if they want their lives to change. Some answer yes, some answer no, and five who answer yes are summoned to the Digital World where they receive the ability to become Digimon and fight to end Kerpymon's reign of terror.
