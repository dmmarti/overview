Use the red button on your Joystick Controller to place your
bet.  You can bet up to five coins each time.  Games 3, 4,
7, and 8 have a maximum of five paylines.  Each bet of one
coin increases the chances of adding to your bank.  For
example, bet three coins and you may win a jackpot on
either the first, second, or third paylines.

Games 1, 2, 5, and 6 only "pay" on the center line (or
payline ).  In these games, the more you bet (up to five
coins) the more you can add to your bank.

After placing your bet, pull back on your Joystick to spin
the reels of the Slot Machine.  In two-player games, both
players must do this to spin the reels.  The game ends
when one player's bank is "broke".  To continue play depress
the game reset switch once.  This adds 25 coins to each
player's bank.  (The game may end with one player going
broke, while the other player has coins remaining.  When
the game reset switch is depressed once, the player who
went broke is given 25 coins, while the player with coins
remaining receives 25 coins plus the amount left when the
game ended.)

In one-player games, you are competing against the computer.
The computer makes a random bet for each play.  The game
ends if you or the computer go broke.  To continue play
depress the game reset switch once.  This adds 25 coins to
each bank.  As in two-player games, the player with coins
remaining when the game ends does not lose those coins when
the game reset switch is depressed once those coins when the
game reset switch is depressed once.
