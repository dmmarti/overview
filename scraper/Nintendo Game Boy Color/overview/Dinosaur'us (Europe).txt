Dinosaur'Us is a puzzle game with Lemmings-like gameplay. Each level is a scrolling screen where baby dinosaurs hatch. The player has to click on them as they come out from their nests, using their abilities to create a path so they can reach the parent dinosaur that acts as the level exit.The hatchlings come in several types, each one with specific abilities. Builder dinosaurs, called diplodocus, stretch their necks to make bridges for the rest of the herd. Crawlers (iguanodons) and diggers (ankylosaurus) make horizontal and vertical tunnels, respectively. Velociraptors can cover small gaps in the terrain by jumping, and are able to remove traps and activate nests. Stegosaurs block the other dinosaurs before they fall to their deaths.
