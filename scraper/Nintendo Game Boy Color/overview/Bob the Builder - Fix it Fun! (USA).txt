Can we play it? Yes we can, as Bob the Builder has now made it to the Game Boy Color in Fix-It Fun. It begins in Bob's yard, where he is greeted by Dizzy, Lofty, Roley, and all his other best friends, all ready for some serious work. Enter Wendy's office and there's a stream of jobs just waiting to be done--notices are in the fax machine, in the files, and on the shelves. Jobs seem to be piling up everywhere, and Bob needs your help to get them done. Scroll up and down the job sheet menu to pick a task, and whether it's Mrs. Potts's fence, the town hall roof, feeding Pilchard, or fixing a wall with muck, it will keep the little ones busy for hours. Each smiley machine has his own adventure for Bob to take part in, and the graphics are superb (as in all BBC children's games), clearly replicating these extremely popular characters.
