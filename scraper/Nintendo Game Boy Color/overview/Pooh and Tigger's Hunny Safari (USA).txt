It's Thursday, and Pooh and Tigger decide they'd like to have a party to celebrate. Help Pooh and Tigger find their friends as they adventure through the magical lands of the Hundred Acre Wood. Collect enough "hunny" pots (watch out--the bees want their "hunny" back) and throw the best Thursday party ever!
