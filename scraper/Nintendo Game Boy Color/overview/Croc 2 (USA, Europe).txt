You travel across 48 levels in this free roaming 3D game. You have to beat all the levels in a village (except the secret level) to move on to the next one. In each village, (except the 4th village) are 5 regular levels, 2 bosses, and 1 secret level. Regular levels are levels where you just beat them and get certain items in them.

Bosses are levels where you go through one section then fight a monster at the end. Secret levels are levels where you collect the jigsaw piece. Once you collect the jigsaw piece in all 4 secret levels and defeat Baron Dante, Swap Meet Pete will take you to the lost levels.
