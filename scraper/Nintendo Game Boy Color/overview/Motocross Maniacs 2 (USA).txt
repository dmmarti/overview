Motocross Maniacs 2 is the follow up to the Game Boy title Motocross Maniacs. Much like in the previous iteration of the game, the aim is to ride a dirt-bike through side-scrolling courses filled with loops, jumps, ramps and hills. There are many bonus items to help the player along the way, such as nitro boosts and super suspension.

The player has the option to play against a computer player or a friend (via Link Cable), as well as Time Trial or Championship.

There is also a level editor and room for three saved custom tracks made by the player.
