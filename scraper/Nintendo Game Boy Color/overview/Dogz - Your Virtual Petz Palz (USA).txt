Dogz is a virtual pet and basically the same game as Catz. The player adopts a dog and has to care for its well-being. The dog walks around in its one-screen room and the player controls a cursor which can be used to pet or grab it. Additionally a few accessories can be selected from a different screen, e.g. a brush, which are used for to keep it healthy and happy. If the player neglects it, the dog runs away. Over time the player can unlock more items and even more dog breeds.
