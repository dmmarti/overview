In Daffy Duck: Fowl Play, Daffy is in search of a hidden treasure that Bugs Bunny told him about.  Unfortunately, the rest of the Looney Tunes cast is out to stop him.

Fowl Play is a nine-level platforming/action game with some unusual mechanics.  Daffy has a hunger meter which he must keep filled.  You must find food throughout the levels and always hurry lest Daffy starve.
