F1 World Grand Prix II is a formula one racing game for the Game Boy. Unlike the Nintendo 64 title of the same name, it features the FIA license for the '99 season with all drivers, teams and tracks that come along with said license. Unlike both the Nintendo 64 and Dreamcast version the Game Boy Color version is completely in 2D, just as its predecessor. Playing modes include: exhibition, Grand Prix, time attack, challenge and match race. The latter is a two player mode which works with a link cable. Like the Nintendo 64 version the challenge mode allows you to replay some critical events in the season. Cars can be completely adjusted (tyres, gears, wings, fuel load) and comes with variable weather conditions. You can change said settings before a race and during pit stops.
