A puzzle game with rotating and sliding blocks. The player must keep the central Klustar from expanding to hit the edges of the screen. Pieces come in from all sides and the whole structure collapses when a block of 3 x 3, 4 x 4 or 5 x 5 is made. More points are scored the bigger the collapse. Ultimately you lose, so this is all about getting a high score..
