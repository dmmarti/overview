Like the original Dragon Warrior Monsters for the Game Boy Color, Dragon Warrior Monsters 2: Tara's Adventure combines themes and characters from Enix' long-running Dragon Warrior series with aspects of gameplay established in the amazingly popular Pokï¿½mon handheld games. Players take on the role of Tara as she embarks on a new adventure of monster collecting, training, and combat. A concurrently released companion game, Dragon Warrior Monsters 2: Cobi's Journey, follows the similar adventures of Tara's brother.
