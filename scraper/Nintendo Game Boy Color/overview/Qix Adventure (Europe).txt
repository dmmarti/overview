Qix, that coin-grabbing arcade upright from the 1980s, is reincarnated for the Game Boy Color as Qix Adventure. Trap a capricious waving form by connecting lines and boxing out its space. Earn the most points by quickly isolating it in the smallest possible space. If the Qix lances your incomplete line, however, you're finished. In Qix Adventure, you'll match your space-saving skills against over 30 bizarre critters that have plundered the treasury of a mystical island. By capturing these creatures, you'll go on to master the unpredictable Qix Helix. Qix Adventure also features an exciting two-player battle mode and the full original arcade version of the game.
