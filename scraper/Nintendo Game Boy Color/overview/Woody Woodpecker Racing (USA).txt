Woody Woodpecker, the loveable Walter Lantz creation, and friends take their high-speed hi-jinx to the raceway and battle it out in this action-racing game. Nine classic characters include the sly prankster himself, Chilly Willy, and gal-pal Winnie Woodpecker. Each character has special abilities to match their own personality. Multiple power-ups are available, including dynamite, homing pigeons and even smelly fish. Choose from four types of vehicle--all terrain vehicles, racers, stock cars and jalopies. Players can race against the computer in 16 track locations, including Las Vegas, Japan and Loch Ness, or against a friend's copy of the game via the Game Link cable
