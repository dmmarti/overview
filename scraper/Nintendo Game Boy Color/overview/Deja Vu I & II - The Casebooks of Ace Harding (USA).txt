The Casebooks of Ace Harding includes Game Boy ports of Deja Vu: A Nightmare Comes True (previously released on Game Boy) and Deja Vu 2: Lost in Las Vegas. Deja Vu is a port of a 1987 game that had been made for various systems. It's a classic detective story, with you waking up to a dead body with total amnesia - you don't know who you are, or how you got there, and you don't know who the corpse is, either. Deja Vu 2 had never been released for Game Boy before, and was put in the same cart, selling for the price of one game.
