You take the role of famed motorcycle daredevil Robert Craig "Evel" Knievel in this game. You control him as he takes on several different stunts:•Wheely Round: Evel must race through a stretch of land while making sure the front tire of his bike does not touch the ground.
Jump Round: Evel must accelerate his bike and calculate the appropriate speed to jump from one ramp to another. Miss the ramp and you lose the round.
Stand Round: Evel must race through a stretch of land while standing on top of his bike!
Approach Round: Evel has to reach the edge of a jump ramp and not go over it. If he does, he loses.
Stand & Wheely Round: Similar to the standard Wheely Round, Evel has to keep his bike's front tire off the ground while standing on it. Some of these stages also feature obstacles such as rocks or barriers. The game also features four different arenas (Dirt Field, Caesar's Palace, Los Angeles Coliseum and Wembly Stadium). The player must complete ten different stunts before moving on to the next stage
