In The Fish Files, you play as Dante, a college student in search of his kidnapped fish, Ramada. This is a traditional inventory-based, point-and-click adventure game in the style of the LucasArts classics.

Dante's quest will take him around the college and the town, as well as into several different time periods, in which you play as two of the other college students whose fish have also disappeared.
