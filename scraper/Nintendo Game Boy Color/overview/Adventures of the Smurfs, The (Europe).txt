The Smurfs have turned orange! You must help Handy Smurf build a machine to save his friends. Your adventures will take you through 16 exciting levels where you will cross a river, travel deep within the mines, fly high up in an airplane, avoid lava from a volcano and so much more! The action is mostly seen from an overhead view, though you can guide your Smurf character to jump across platforms.
