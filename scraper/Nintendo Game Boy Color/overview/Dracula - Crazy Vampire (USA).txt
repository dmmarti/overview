Dracula: Crazy Vampire is a 2D top-down game, starring count Dracula. The game uses cartoony "big-heads" stylized graphics. Dracula slept long time. Now, he has new enemy - Grand Inquisitor Torquemada, and must find 11 of his fellow vampires. The Count explores the castle, and fights against various opponents - he shoots bats. Drinking the enemies' blood replenishes health. Dracula must also solve some puzzles by moving crates, flipping switches, opening doors, or lowering drawbridges. He can talk to others characters. The game has eleven levels, some of which take place outside the castle. In those levels, Dracula must avoid the deadly sunbeams.
