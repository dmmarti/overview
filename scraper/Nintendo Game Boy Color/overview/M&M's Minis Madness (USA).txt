The Minis have escaped and are wreaking havoc on the M&M factory. It is up to four intrepid heroes Red, Green, Yellow, and Blue to capture the Minis and return the factory to normal. You must choose the appropriate character for each situation the heroes encounter, as they each have a special skill. Blue can swim, Green has a deadly kiss attack, Yellow can bounce high into the air, and Red can use a spin attack to destroy enemies. If you encounter an area the current character is not able to get past, you can switch to another characters with the select button. Learning how and when to use these abilities is key to conquering all 12 levels in the game. So play M&M MINI MADNESS and try to save the factory before the Minis destroy it.
