Woodpeckers certainly don't come any wackier than our friend, Woody Woodpecker. He certainly has his work cut out against his sworn enemy, the evil Buzz Buzzard. This feathered fiend has kidnapped Woody's nephews, Knothead and Splinter and locked them up in his own amusement park, Buzz Buzzard's Park. To free them, Woody has to take on Buzz through 15 crazy levels of adventures where he will have to show quick reflexes, have a few clever tricks up his sleeve, not to mention a good sense of humour.
