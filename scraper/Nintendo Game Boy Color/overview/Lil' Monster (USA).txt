Lil' Monster is an RPG strongly inspired by Pokémon games, the major differences being that it has no open world. The player simply selects locations on map.  The player uses small monsters for training and battling. The battle rewards the player with experience for the monsters to level-up and gems. In town, he can buy or sell various items. There is also a special Arena.  In battles, the player selects the monster's special command to use each turn.
