In the world of Puchi Carat, thieves stole the twelve gems that made the people's dreams come true. They sold them to evil sorcerers who used them to suppress the people. Now, a long time after these events, the gems came into the possession of twelve mysterious characters. Each one of them tries to get a hold of the remaining jewels to fulfill their dreams - some of them seek peace while others want to satisfy their hunger for power.  Puchi Carat takes its inspiration from the video game classic Breakout. The player has to clear rows of gems with a ball launched from a cursor that can only move horizontally on the bottom of the screen. In regular intervals, the stones will move one row towards the bottom. Once they reach a line just above the cursor, the game is over. New rows of jewels also appear if the player is unable to catch the ball and it bounces off the floor on the very bottom of the screen.
