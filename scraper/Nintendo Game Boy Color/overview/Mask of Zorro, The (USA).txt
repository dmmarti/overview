The Mask of Zorro is based on the 1998 movie of the same name. It closely follows the plot of the movie: In 1821 the Spanish (and evil) governor Don Rafael Montero controls California. Against him stands the masked rebel Zorro. Unfortunately Zorro gets captured and is imprisoned. 20 years later he manages to escape prison and trains a successor to continue his quest. Regarding gameplay, this is a side-scrolling platformer with a focus on fencing. The fighting mechanics allow Zorro to perform different moves, including blocking, in order to hit the enemies. Each character has an energy bar which decreases when hit and leads to death when it is empty.
