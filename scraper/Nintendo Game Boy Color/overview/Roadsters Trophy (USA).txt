Roadsters for the Game Boy Color is a portable version of the game of the same name released for the N64, Dreamcast, and Playstation, though it is largely the same in name alone.

The game features three racers and no licensed cars. The game is largely built around a basic "World Tour" racing competition and involves light gambling elements, and the ability to repair damages to your car between races. Tracks may be chosen by the player between challenges.  

While it is a Game Boy Color release, it is adaptable to older Game Boy Systems, and the Super Game Boy.
