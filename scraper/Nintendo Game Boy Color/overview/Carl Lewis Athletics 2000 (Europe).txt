Carl Lewis Athletics 2000 is a sports game focusing on Decathlon and its ten disciplines: pole vault, long jump, shot put, discus throw, javelin throw, high jump and running (100, 110, 400 and 150 metres). The controls follow the traditional mechanics: rhythmic button mashing, if necessarily followed by pressing an action button. Besides the traditional championship mode, the player can also participate in the arcade mode in which a certain performance must be met in order to qualify to the next event. Unlockable by winning the Decathlon is a special mode with three additional disciplines: hurdles (200 and 400 metres) and 100 metres relay race. The player creates an athlete who is saved on the cartridge and can be improved by training.
