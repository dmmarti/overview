Xena: Warrior Princess is 2D action game, based on the "Xena" TV series. The game is similar to Zelda in which you go and talk to people and kill monsters. You take control of Xena as she fights on land and in the water. The Warrior Princess can run, slash, jump, climb, or (later) swim - but she must fight against various enemies, for example rabbits and birds. Some puzzles require that you find the right item, or go through a maze.
