In a post-Cold War world, you can never tell when your next mission will be. In F-18 Thunderstrike, you're the pilot of an F-18 Strike Eagle, one of the most effective war machines ever made. Trouble in the Balkan region of southeastern Europe means your country needs you and your F-18 to suppress rogue governments and make the region safe.To do this, you'll have to fly sorties against MiG fighters. You'll use the F-18 Strike Eagle's instrument control panel and Heads Up Display (HUD) for targeting, radar, and landing displays. At your side are twin 20mm cannons to take down the bad guys
