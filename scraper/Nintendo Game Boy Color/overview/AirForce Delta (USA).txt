As a jet fighter pilot in a civil war, the player will take to the skies in a behind-the-plane view for ten missions with a selection of up to eight aircraft. 

To complete a mission, the player must destroy a certain number of enemy aircraft or ground targets then destroy a boss air or ground craft. Each mission will reward the player with money. When the player has beaten the boss, the money may then be used to purchase new planes and upgrades for those planes.
