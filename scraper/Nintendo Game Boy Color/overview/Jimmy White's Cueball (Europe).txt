Jimmy White's Cueball is a pool game which offers the variations straight, 8 ball, 9 ball along with snooker and four opponents to play against (Broke Ben, Nine Nigel, Suzy Cue and Jimmy White). The game is entirely shown from a top-down view and offers no surprises when it comes to controls: first the player sets the direction of the cue and changes the spin by changing the dot on a miniature ball shown in the right hand corner. Lastly the power of the shot is determined with a power bar on which a line moves from the left to right (and vice versa) and the player has to press the button when it is at the desired position.
