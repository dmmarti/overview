Dragon Ball Z: Legendary Super Warriors allows the player to play all his or her favorite Dragon Ball Z fights using cards to do battle. Similar to the Pokémon Trading Card Game, cards are used to power up characters and use special abilities to defeat the enemy. Players can create custom decks, and play against a friend using the Link Cable.
