This handheld version of Tiger Woods PGA Tour 2000 is the only game in the series to appear on the Game Boy Color. The game lets the player compete against six pros from the PGA Tour. There are four different modes of play: stroke, tournament, skins game and shoot out. Three courses exist: Summerlin, Sawgrass and Scottsdale. These are all official Tournament Players Club courses. Up to four players, either human or computer controlled, can play at any time.

When playing the player first get to see a top down view of the tee. He can here get information about wind and terrain and adjust his spin and cross hair. Once ready, the player has to use a power meter to take the shot. The player has to click it three times, first to start the backswing, then to end the backswing at the right strength and finally to strike the ball at the right time.
