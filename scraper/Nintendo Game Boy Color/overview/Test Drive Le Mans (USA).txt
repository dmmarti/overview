Test Drive: Le Mans is a racing game for the Game Boy Color. The game features three racing modes: Arcade, Le Mans, and Championship. Le Mans allows you to race on the actual circuit, while Championship lets you race on 10 real tracks from all around the world. The arcade mode includes power-ups such as boosts, and oil slicks that bring your car to a slip. There are 10 different cars to race with such as the Nissan R390 and the BMW V12 VMR, with each their own handling and appearance.
