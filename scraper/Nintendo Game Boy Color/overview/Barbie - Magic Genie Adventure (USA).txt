Head on a magical adventure with Barbie and friends in BARBIE: Magic Genie Adventure for Game Boy Color. In this one-player adventure, you'll ride a magic carpet through five different wondrous worlds filled with mystery and danger as you gather magic powers and abilities to help you on your journey! Barbie Magic Genie Adventure sticks to straight side-scrolling action and an extremely simple control scheme to attract girl gamers. The combination works somewhat, because of good graphics and a decent amount of level objectives, which will keep players busy. Barbie Magic Genie Adventure sends Barbie on her carpet through castles and forests, as she looks for crystals, harps, and other items that are necessary to fulfill the quests that Barbie encounters through the game. From time to time, Barbie even will get to play games, which are hopelessly simplistic, but add variety nonetheless.
