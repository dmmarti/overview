Guide Hugo, the TV troll, to free Kiku from the monsters. The game consists of several small platform levels, Donkey Kong-style. Different platforms are connected by ladders and there are enemies such as ghosts, alligators and mummies, along with doors through which they can respawn. To complete a level, you need to collect all red diamonds.As the title suggests, your aim should be the black diamonds. Once all the red ones have been collected, you can kill enemies to receive black diamonds. Hugo attacks using his whip - a single hit will stun foes, the second finishes them off. The challenge is in trying to avoid the enemies until you have collected all red diamonds. If you kill them too early, you will only receive coins or power-ups. Each level is time restricted - if time runs out, all enemies turn red and move much faster.
