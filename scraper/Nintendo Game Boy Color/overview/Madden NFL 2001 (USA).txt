The first mobile entry in the series to be published by Electronic Arts proper instead of THQ, Madden NFL 2001 is the second iteration on the Game Boy Color, from new developer 3d6 Games.

The game modes are Exhibition, Season and Playoffs, and for the first time, the game also offers a two-player mode over the link cable. The 2D top-down graphics have been improved compared to earlier versions, and the game offers quarterback speech for the first time on a mobile platform.

Gameplay features are as usual: a large playbook, audibles, player injuries and substitutions, and detailed statistics. The game features the player stats and team names and logos from the 2000 NFL season.
