Speedy Gonzales: Aztec Adventure is a side-scrolling platformer based on the Looney Tunes cartoons. Sylvester the cat has kidnapped all mice from Speedy's village and Speedy has to free them. The focus of the game is on platforming and, as Speedy's character dictates, running through the levels at a high speed. There is also the occasional enemy to fight with weapons (smoke bombs, boomerangs, etc.) which have to picked up first. Other extras to pick up include extra lives, extra life energy or speed enhancements. There are six levels in total with three stages each (some of them spent in a boat or underwater) and one boss per level.
