NYR: New York Race for the Game Boy Color is a futuristic racing game inspired by the 1997 French film The Fifth Element. Unlike the version for console and PC, the handheld presents the races in a top-down view with less features and options.  The game consists of several divisions of 2 tracks each. Only the first division is available from the start, others are unlocked by placing first in all races of earlier ones. At the beginning, only the taxi (as driven by Bruce Willis' character in the film) can be used. Further cars must be purchased with money won in the races (by placing first, second or third). Eight different cars are available to buy, differing in ratings for power, traction and shield strength. The more powerful cars can only be bought upon reaching higher divisions. Progress through the game is stored via passwords.  Races are against three opponents, take place on circular courses and consist of four laps. The futuristic hovercars have the ability to change altitude, either driving on the ground or high in the air. Flying high is necessary for maximum speed, but there are obstacles on the track that can only be passed by driving under them. There are also power-ups that can only be picked up when on the ground. These include missiles, shields, speed boosts, slowdown bubbles and short-time invulnerability. An arrow is always in view and points out corners and, when in high altitude, obstacles.
