Kelly Club: Clubhouse Fun for the Game Boy Color takes kids to the Kelly Club tree house to help Kelly gain items for her magic show. Players will create Kelly Constellations with Liana to help get Kelly a magic wand. Another adventure takes kids through a maze of Egyptian ruins in a search for Queen Diedre's kittens and magic dust for Kelly. There are eight levels of play in all, with varying degrees of difficulty to keep kids from getting bored or frustrated. Along the way, players will earn special keys that unlock secret passageways filled with surprises.
