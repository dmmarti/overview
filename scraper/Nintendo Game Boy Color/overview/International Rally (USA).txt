International Rally is a rally game with 20 courses and 14 cars which differ in speed, acceleration and adhesion. During the tournament, the player has the possibility to upgrade the car, e.g. a better engine or a speed enhancement, and adjust the damper and tires according to the known weather conditions of the next race. The effectiveness of the car components wears down over the course of the tournament. Other available playing modes are single rallies, time races and duels with a human opponent.
