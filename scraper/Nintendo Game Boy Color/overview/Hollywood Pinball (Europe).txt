Hollywood Pinball is a pinball game with seven tables with different themes: Shark!, Terror Dactyl!, Double Agent, The Legend of Robin Hood, Galaxy Wars, Ancient Temple of the Aczecs and Motel Hell. All tables are clearly inspired by movie franchises, e.g. Indiana Jones, and have no major differences regarding their setup. As always the goal is to keep the ball on the table as long as possible and accumulating points for the high score by hitting obstacles like bumpers. Every table also has a special quest which rewards many points, e.g. collecting (i.e. bumping into) rockets and then hitting a special target.
