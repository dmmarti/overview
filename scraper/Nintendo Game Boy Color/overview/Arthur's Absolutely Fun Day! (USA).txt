Based on the PBS children's cartoon, ARTHUR'S ABSOLUTELY FUN DAY offers up a ton of fun for fans of the show. In this single-player game for Game Boy Color, you play as Arthur, who wants to go to the ultimate amusement park, Wonder World. There are over 15 mini-games in Arthur's neighborhood (including air hockey, shooting hoops, cooking pancakes, and a whole lot more), each with its own style of gameplay, from simple timing exercises to mild puzzle solving. You get stars for completing them and once you have enough, you will earn a free pass to Wonder World, where all the mini-games are available for you to play whenever you like. ARTHUR'S ABSOLUTELY FUN DAY is an ideal choice for a younger gamer.
