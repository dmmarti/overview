Help the good old boys solve another Hazzard County mystery in The Dukes of Hazzard: Racing for Home for the Game Boy Color. There are full area maps to help Bo and Luke Duke keep track of the likes of Boss Hogg. The General Lee loves a race, and the variable terrain helps her drop a load of mud on the opposition's windshield. To make sure that the General Lee stays out of Cooter's shop, players should keep an eye on the collision meter. And, to make sure that the Duke boys stay out of the Graybar Hotel (get it?), players can take advantage of several hiding places to elude Sheriff Roscoe P. Coltrane.
