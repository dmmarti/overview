For the uninitiated, Ultimate Fighting Championship wrestling is a no-holds-barred fighting game that sees two or more opponents in a wire cage beating the hell out of each other any way they choose. Kicking punching, boxing, wrestling and martial arts are all accepted forms of battle. The gameplay represents this and apart from having a number of celebrity fighters from the real sport, allows you to make one from scratch with their own fighting style.
