MTV Sports: Pure Ride is a snowboarding game for the Game Boy Color. Unlike the PlayStation version it's completely 2D and differs in game modes. The Game Boy Color version comes with tour challenge, half-pipe competition and a training mode. The tour challenge features fictional courses from all over the world where you have to race downhill and perform tricks. Half-pipe competition is played in a different perspective and is focused more on performing tricks. IN the training mode you can practice tricks at your own leisure. There are 23 possible tricks in the game.
