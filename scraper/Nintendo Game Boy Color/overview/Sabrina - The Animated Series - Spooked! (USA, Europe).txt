Sabrina is no newcomer to computer gaming, and this is her second appearance on the Game Boy Color. Sabrina Spooked is aimed at 6 to 9 year olds, so the basic story line is straightforward: Sabrina and her faithful cat Salem follow their aunts through a magic portal; there they discover that the Spooky Man--a baddie, of course--has kidnapped them in order to steal their magic powers, along with those of the world's other witches and wizards. Sabrina sets out to foil the Spooky Man's plan, using a range of spells across four different gaming worlds. The game takes a platform format--you move around and over obstacles, knocking out the enemy on the way. Zapping presents is a good idea, as this reveals goodies such as extra health, spells, and lives. Each level has an exit portal that's only opened when you've found three crystals. When Sabrina gets to a portal she has to survive a trap set by the Spooky Man. There are no shortcuts to getting this job done. You can switch between controlling Sabrina or Salem. Salem is quite small, making him very useful for getting through tiny spaces--but he can't defeat enemies, so you need to think carefully about when best to use him.
