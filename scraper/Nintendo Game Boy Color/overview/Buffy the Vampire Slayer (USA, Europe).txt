Fight against the vampires to save mankind, or at least around Sunnydale, USA.

Punch and kick your way through 8 side-scrolling levels as Buffy the vampire slayer, beating back the vamps and staking them when the time is right. Comic book style cut scenes help to explain the story as you play, as if an episode of the TV show was on the handheld.
