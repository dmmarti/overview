In Sesame Street Sports, kids are challenged to six Sesame Street sporting events featuring their favourite Sesame Street friends. Steer Grover on his unicycle, shoot the rapids with Ernie in his bathtub, race with Zoe on her Big Wheel, slip and slide with Telly on his snow saucer, go bouncing with Cookie Monster, and guide Elmo through town on his in-line skates. This game was produced especially for young children, and features a special verbal tutorial that shows even the youngest of gamers how to play.
