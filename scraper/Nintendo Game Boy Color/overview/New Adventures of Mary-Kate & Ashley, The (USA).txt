Help Mary-Kate and Ashley solve five mysteries by dinnertime in THE NEW ADVENTURES OF MARY-KATE & ASHLEY. You take the roles of Mary-Kate, Ashley, and their dog Clue. Each character has a set of special abilities: Mary-Kate can jump to high ledges, Ashley can flip switches, and Clue can fit through narrow openings or give the girls a boost to higher areas. On each level, the girls and Clue must use their talents and work together to collect a puzzle piece. If you get stuck, there are three clue pieces scattered in each stage. Collect all three pieces, and you are given a hint on how to collect the puzzle piece. Digitized voice-work throughout the game will make you think you are really playing with Mary-Kate and Ashley. Try to solve all of the mysteries in THE NEW ADVENTURES OF MARY-KATE & ASHLEY.
