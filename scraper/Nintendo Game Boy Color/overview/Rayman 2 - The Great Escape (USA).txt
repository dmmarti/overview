Rayman 2 for the Game Boy Color is a 2D side-scrolling platformer.  You play as Rayman, an odd looking creature without arms or legs.  You must jump, hover, climb, and throw your fists on your quest to collect balls of energy called Lums and find the Four Masks of Polokus and eventually defeat Admiral Razorbeard and his robo-pirate army.
