Monster Rancher BattleCard GB combines traditional overhead-view RPG gameplay with a complete collectible card game. Players familiar with other Monster Rancher games will recognize characters and places, but no prior Ranching experience is needed to play the game.

The player explores a secluded island village and the caves nearby, battling opponents in card games. As they progress, defeated opponents will add to their collection of cards and items.
