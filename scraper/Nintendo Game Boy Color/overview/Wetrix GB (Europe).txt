In Wetrix the player must build barriers on the arena to stop the water from leaking out. As time progresses, rain starts to fall onto the arena, so the player must try to keep the walls as high as possible to catch the water. Too much on the screen will start an earthquake. Ice blocks fall to freeze the water. Bombs drop, leaving holes in walls, and fireballs vaporize the water. The aim is to get as high a score as possible. There is a practice mode available, and the game can be played in multiplayer against a friend.
