Attention Tetrisholics: now you can rediscover the raw pleasure of playing a Tetris-like game, but this time with a new twist. Dice are falling down. You must rotate them, align them, and pile them up to make them vanish. Match colors and numbers to eliminate the dice, and battle against your friends using the Game Link cable. Features include fast and colorful gameplay, 16 difficulty levels, two game modes, a matching dice principle that enables multiple new game strategies, and a two-player exclusive battle mode using the Game Link.
