Edward Carnaby, private eye of the paranormal, is back.

Carnaby's best friend, Charles Fiske, has been found dead near Shadow Island--a mysterious island near Maine. It is your duty to take up the investigation and find out the secrets of Shadow Island. The game takes place in the surrounding grounds of a gloomy mansion. The game is dark...very dark, and in true survival horror style there are many things lurking, waiting to pounce.

9 years after the original was released, the game that started it all returns for a new chapter in the Alone in the Dark series.

Can you see.......beyond your fear?
