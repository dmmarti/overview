Your mission is to construct a communicator so that E.T. can phone home. And just like Elliott and his friends in the movie, you'll have your work cut out for you. In this release for Game Boy Color, you must search 60 environments for all the components needed to build the transmitter. All the while, you have to evade capture by government agents and avoid the clever traps they've set for you. You can alternate playing as the strategic-minded Elliott or as E.T., whose extraordinary powers, including levitation, can help you out of the many tricky situations you'll confront. This single-player game features three levels of difficulty and three modes of gameplay: exploration, quest, and encounter. Six large maps with 10 environments in each extend playability, as do 45 challenging miniquests that unlock hidden items you can trade later.
