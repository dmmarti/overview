10-PIN BOWLING brings you all the fun of bowling in miniature form on your Game Boy Color. Play by yourself or with a friend in 10 frames of simple straight-up bowling action. Challenge your friend to see who's better or challenge your own scores to see if you can beat them. Aim carefully and apply the right amount of strength and you'll be racking up strikes in no time. This cartridge also uses the Rumble technology so you can feel every strike and spare in the alley. 10-PIN BOWLING features everything but the stinky shoe rentals. Will you rule the lane, or will you just be another gutter ball?
