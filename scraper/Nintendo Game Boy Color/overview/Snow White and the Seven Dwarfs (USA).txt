Help Snow White avoid the evil clutches of the jealous queen and seek refuge in the dwarfs' forest home. Beware of strangers peddling apples, and find Prince Charming, your true love, to live happily ever after. This game enables you to interactively partake in the story of Walt Disney's award-winning animated movie. All your favorite (and least favorite) characters are included: Snow White, Dopey, Happy, Grumpy, Sleepy, Sneezy, Bashful, Doc, Prince Charming, and the wicked queen. The charming, vivid environments and in-game animations were created by Disney Studios. There are two game modes: in story mode, you can explore seven different levels, gather items, and win bonus games to unlock chapters of the tale; in playground mode, you will discover minigames and challenging puzzles. As you beat each challenge, the classic story of Walt Disney's Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs will unfold on the screen.
