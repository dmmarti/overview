Quest RPG: Brian's Journey is simple RPG game, related with Quest 64. Game's action takes place in Celtland, a fantastic medieval world. A player controls an apprentice mage - Brian. He lived in small town. One day the town was attacked by monsters. Now, Brian must go on a quest to restore peace and harmony.  The game is a top-down RPG; the player moves on the map, talks to various characters, and fights against enemies, like crocodiles, wolves or knights. Brian can use four elements to make spells: Fire, Water, Earth and Wind, and combine them to create special moves. He can use hand-attack too, but this hits less strong. Battles are "turn-based": the player moves in small squares, and chooses his attack. He can also dodge enemy's attacks.
