Rugrats: Time Travelers is a side-scrolling 2D platform game based on the Daytime Emmy-award winning animated television series.

In this Rugrats game the toddlers have found a time machine which has spread them out all over time and space. It is up to the player to help each rugrat find his special toy, another baby and/or a certain number of items, and most importantly a portal back home. There are twelve levels in which you play different Rugrats. Settings include the gold rush, ancient Egypt, prehistory, magical fairy world, a circus and space.

In between the platform levels are special bonus levels that can be unlocked by finding B-letter blocks.
