Tomb Raider: Curse of the Sword contains five large areas to explore. Afflicted with a terrible curse, Lara must follow a group of thieves from a museum in Manhattan, across rooftops in Soho, down into the New York subway system, beyond the Brooklyn Docks, and all the way to their hideout in Bermuda.

As you guide Lara to a cure, you'll experience the usual amounts of ledge jumping and rope climbing that one expects from a game in the Tomb Raider series, as well as a number of activities unique to this particular release, such as boss battles, demolitions, and submarine piloting.
