Now the thrill and excitement of Deer Hunter has come to the Game Boy Color system! Practice sighting in your rifle, shotgun or bow at the range, or choose to hunt from a tree-stand or the brush. Then, get ready to lock in your sights on the largest rack in the woods. So, dust off your boots and break out the blaze orange, because with Deer Hunter, it's open season year'round.
