Pok�mon Gold takes place several years after Red, Blue and Yellow, and puts the user into a brand new world, Johto. The gameplay is very similar to the previous games, but with several improvements. These include new functions for the player's Pok�Gear, a Pok�dex that can now be sorted by evolution type, and, of course, new Pok�mon. Once again, the objective of the game is to become the champion trainer, and try to complete the Pok�dex. To become the champion, the player battles Gym Leaders to obtain various badges. Completing the Pok�dex requires a different set of actions, and involves capturing wild Pok�mon, battling various trainers to obtain money, and trading Pok�mon with NPC's and other owners of Pok�mon games.
