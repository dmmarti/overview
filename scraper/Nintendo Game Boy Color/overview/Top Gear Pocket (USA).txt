Rally race through the city streets, grasslands and sandy terrain against eight other racers (or a friend) to the finish line. The higher you rank at the end of each race, the more new tracks you open up (including tracks full of ice). Time trial mode also allows you to test the time on each track.

12 cars are available to drive, each with different handling and speed abilites and you can choose to race each car either with manual or automatic gearbox changes. The in-built rumble feature of the cart also vibrates to each crash and burn you make.
