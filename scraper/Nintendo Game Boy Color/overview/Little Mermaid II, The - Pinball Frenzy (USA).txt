This game is basically Pok�mon Pinball minus all the pok�mon plus Ariel and her young daughter, Melody -- and a lot of minigames.

The game features four-player support via alternating tables, as well as a battery-powered rumble feature for those who absolutely must feel every tilt and tumble of the table.
