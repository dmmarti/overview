You play Hiro Miyamoto an average martial arts instructor who gets involved in a mission of time-shattering proportions. You must rescue the girl from the evil corporation, find the sword with the girl, and travel back in time with the sword, the girl and a Superfly to get a vaccine for a virus that has wiped out two-thirds of the world's populace. The sword is the Daikatana, a weapon wielded by your ancestors, and you areï¿½ a guy with guns that fires at things a lot. This is a shooter, which means that while there are cutscenes and plotlines happening in the background, most of it is window dressing for miles of action and gallons of blood and flayed flesh.
