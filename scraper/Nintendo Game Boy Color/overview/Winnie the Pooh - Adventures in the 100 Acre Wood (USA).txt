Winnie the Pooh, a family favourite for more than three generations and subject of numerous books, songs and movies, now stars in his very first video game. Winnie the Pooh: Adventures in the 100 Acre Wood contains 15 fun-filled activities and mini-games, including fishing with Pooh, bouncing with Tigger, hunting for honey and catching acorns. You can play the games as Pooh, Tigger or as any of the other characters in this game's cast. As you play, the game environments expand to enable players to win special game cards and picture rewards. Pooh's first video game looks to provide acres and acres of colourful--and portable-gameplay.
