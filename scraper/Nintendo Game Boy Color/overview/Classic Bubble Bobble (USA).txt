Blue Dino has become ill, and its up to Green Dino to find a cure. Essentially a remake of the classic arcade title, without the ability to play with two players.

The aim of the game is to use your Dino's bubble abilities to trap and pop the bad guys while dodging their attacks to complete the level, collecting the bonus items along the way. Popping the enemies turns them into fruit for bonus points.
