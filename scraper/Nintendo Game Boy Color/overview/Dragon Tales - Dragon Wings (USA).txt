The popular animated television series is now a magical hand-held game! You take on the role of a dragon that has yet to learn the secrets of flight in this exciting adventure. You'll attend Quetzal's School in the Sky, where you'll practice your wing flapping, hovering, treasure carrying, and breathing. Once your confidence is high and your skills honed, you'll enter the enchanted Dragon Land, where all sorts of mischief awaits you. Journey through 15 levels of difficult obstacles and dangerous terrain, meeting up with a few friendly faces straight out of the television show along your path. There are three difficulty levels to choose from, so gamers at all skill levels can get in on the action. The game is only intended for one player, but you can always complete a game and then challenge a friend to match your progress. Learning to fly has never been so fun or safe.
