Hugo: The Evil Mirror is a basic arcade platformer of approximately 60 levels of exactly the same task. In each challenge, players must leap along platform layouts and freeze enemies with a special ice cannon. Turning enemies into cubes will take them out of commission for a few seconds if left alone, but if you choose to carry them they'll stay cubes for as long as you can hold them. Shattering the cubes by leaping on them or dropping them one or more stories will take them out for good, but they'll return to the playfield if you don't seal up the portals scattered across the level. Once all the enemies have been defeated, it's off to the next level of increasing difficulty.
