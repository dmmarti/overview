Miss Piggy, Fozzie, Rowlf, Gonzo the Great, Sam the Eagle and Swedish Chef all decide to travel back to the past using a big time machine built by Dr. Bunsen Honeydew and Beaker. Somehow the time machine breaks down, and sends the friends to unexpectedly different time locations. Now it's up to their friends - Animal and Kermit - to go to these locations and bring them back home.  Jim Henson's Muppets is an arcade game based on the TV program The Muppets Show. Players control either Animal or Kermit to different time locations which hold their friends. There are a total of 6 locations. Players can freely choose the location they want to play. Each location contains 3 selectable levels and an unlockable level (can only be played after finishing the selectable levels). The selectable levels have the same objective: find your way to the goal. The unlockable is where you encounter with a boss and save your friend. Animal fights using his drum sticks, while Kermit throws paper planes at enemies. Enemies (except the bosses) cannot identify the players' character, therefore don't fight at all. They simply just move from side to side. There are some items that aid players during the game: food (increase health), heart (give players one life), drum sticks (when playing as Animal)/paper planes (when playing as Kermit). Pressing a combination of button can enable Animal and Kermit to use special moves: Animal's earthquake and Kermit's super high jump.  The graphics are in 2D. Players can save their process by choosing "Save" in the level choosing menu. At the beginning of a level or when players die, Statler and Waldorf will present exchanging a short conversation about the level.
