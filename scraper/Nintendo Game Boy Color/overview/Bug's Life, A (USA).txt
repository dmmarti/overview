Based on the Disney/Pixar 3D animated film, you must guide Flik as he sets out to find a group of warrior insects to help his colony of ants to fight off the hungry grasshoppers.

Unlike the other versions of this game, the GBC version is a 2D side-scroller. You must guide Flik in finding parts for his inventions. Along the way, you must avoid other enemy insects, including the grasshoppers, or hit them with berries.
