Batter up!  Or, uhm... Stick-Men Up!?!   The game of baseball for your very own Fairchild Channel-F home videogame system.  Two players go head-to-head to see who is the King of the Diamond.  One player takes to the field, the other grabs a bat and steps up to the plate.  The pitcher can throw fast, slow, and some wicked curves even at the last moment.  Luckily the single-button swing action makes hitting the ball fairly easy, even if getting a single is harder than hitting a double or home-run.
