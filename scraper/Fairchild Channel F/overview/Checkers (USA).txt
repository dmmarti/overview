This game features a playable version of the board game Checkers. Players control the 12 checkers at the bottom of the screen and attempt to remove the 12 checkers at the top of the screen which are controlled by a computer opponent. Players can only move their checkers diagonally toward their opponents side of the board. A checker can be jumped when two opposing checkers are next to each other and there is an empty space on the diagonal of the checker getting jumped. If a checker is put into a position of being able to be jumped it must be jumped. If a checker happens to reach the other side of the board, that checker is kinged and is allowed to move both back and forth in diagonal movements. The game is won by the player who removes all their opponents checkers from the board.
