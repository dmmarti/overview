This game attempts to simulate a slot machine. The player can choose their starting purse (from $1 up to $99 in one dollar or $10 increments) and then choose how much they want to bet on each spin of the slot reels.  Each bet can be either for 5¢,10¢,25¢, or 50¢.  The game offers two modes. Random Play mode lets the wheel spin and then stop randomly and the Select Play mode lets the player stop each wheel one at a time when it's spinning.
