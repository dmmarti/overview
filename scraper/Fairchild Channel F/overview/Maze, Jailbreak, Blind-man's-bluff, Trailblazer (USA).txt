Poor little mice, doomed to run around in a maze and escape as quickly as they can.  As if that's not enough, the owner's of this maze pit you against a friend to see who will escape first.  And then the diabolical owners take it one step further and add a cat to the maze mix -- forcing you not only to escape first, but escape alive!  This game contains a few variations:  A straight maze run, a jailbreak maze (break through each square), an invisible maze, and a hidden maze (eat your way through I guess).  In all the variations you can choose between 1-4 speeds and/or throw the cat in the maze for an extra challenge.
