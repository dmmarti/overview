The object of the game is to knock down as many pins in 10 frames of bowling, The game gives the player an overhead view of a bowling lane. The player's bowling ball starts out moving back and forth across the front of the lane. This has the player trying to get the lane position they want the ball to start traveling down. Once the ball starts rolling down the lane, the player can curve the ball left or right. Once the curve has started, it can't be changed further.  The game contains 18 game variations. They involve choosing the combination of number of players (1 or 2 players), playing either a regular or split game, and then choosing the speed of play (slow,normal,fast, and fastest).  The regular game, just like it sounds like, is a regular game of bowling featuring the usual rules of play.  The split game has each frame starting  with some combination of less than 10 pins. The player has 2 balls to knock down the remaining pins in each frame.
