Videocart-3 features a computerized version of the card game blackjack. The game follows the typical blackjack rules; your goal is to get cards totaling as close to 21 as possible without going over. The computer acts as the dealer, and is required to hit on a 16 or 'soft 17' and is required to stay on a 'hard 17'. The game features a full 52 card deck, and the computer will automatically shuffle the deck if there are less than 16 cards left; optionally you can request the computer reshuffle the deck at any time. One or two players can play, each player beginning the game with $500. There is a minimum bet of $1 and a maximum bet of $99. In the two player game a player who has gone broke may optionally borrow $100 from the house to re-enter the game.
