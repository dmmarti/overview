This game features a simulation of the card game five-card draw poker. 3 players (either 1 or 2 can be human, the rest are controlled by the computer) are dealt five cards each. Players then take turns either calling or raising a bet (which can be up to $25), or if they don't like their cards they can fold. Once that round of betting is done players then can choose to discard up to three of their cards in exchange for three new cards in an attempt to make a better hand. Another round of betting then takes place and after that all the players that didn't fold their hands show their cards and whoever has the highest hand wins all the money in the pot.
