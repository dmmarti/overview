This game cart contains two space themed games.  In Galactic Space Wars, players take control of a fighter spacecraft with the sole objective to find and destroy enemy spacecrafts.  Players take a first person perspective from inside the cockpit of the space fighter searching the vast area of space in order to locate enemy craft. Once an enemy craft is located, players try to quickly scroll the enemy ship into their lasers sight. If the enemy stays on the screen to long, it will be able to fire a shot at the player's ship and score a hit. There are four different types of enemy crafts each worth a varying amount of points for being destroyed. The player is given a limited amount of time to destroy as many ships as possible and to try not to let the enemy ships get hits on their spacecraft.  Lunar Lander seems to have been inspired by the same titled arcade game Lunar Lander. Players pilot a lunar lander and attempt to have a soft landing on a landing platform. The lunar lander only has a certain amount of fuel to maneuver around with thus adding to the challenge. The key is to have a soft landing by gently and smoothly lowering the lander onto the platform, as landing coming down too fast or missing the platform entirely crashes the lunar lander. Their is also a timer keeping count of the amount of time it takes for the player to land the lunar lander. The objective is to land the craft in the least amount of time possible.
