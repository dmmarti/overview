Video Whizball is a game where players control paddles that have to protect a goal from being entered by whizballs. To protect their goal, the player's paddle can fire missiles which can be aimed straight or angled up or downward. Missiles that hit whizballs can help propel them to start going in an opposite direction. If one of the missiles (or whizballs for that matter) hit the player's paddle or an opponent's paddle, their paddle will temporarily disappear leaving their goal undefended. The game is won when either one of the players gets to a selected score.  The game contains 72 game variations of this basic premise. Variations includes having from 1 to 4 whizballs (the game cart also refers to these as boulders by the way), and having 6 different game types. Game types are Basic where each whizball is worth only 1 point, Basic Plus where players can guide the missile shots into the whizballs, Bonus where whizballs can be numbered 1 thru 4 and are worth that many points each, Bonus Plus which adds guided missiles to the Bonus game type, Super Bonus where whizballs increase in value from 1 to 9 points the longer they stay in play, and Super Bonus Plus which adds guided missile shots to the Super Bonus game type.
