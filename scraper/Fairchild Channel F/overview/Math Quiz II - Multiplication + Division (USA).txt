Videocart-7 contains the second and last part of the Math Quiz series started with Videocart-6. While the first part lets the players train addition and subtraction, Math Quiz II deals with multiplication and division.  Once again, the game presents the player with a series of problems, simple multiplications in the first game variation, and simple divisions in the second. The results have to be entered using the controller. If the answer is correct, a point will be added to the left counter. After entering a wrong answer, the player gets another chance to correct the result. If it is wrong again, the right counter will be increased, counting the mistakes made so far.
