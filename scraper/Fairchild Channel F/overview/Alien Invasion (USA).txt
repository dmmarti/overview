This game is very similar to Space Invaders. The player controls a gun turret at the bottom of the screen. The turret can move both left and right and is able to shoot missiles. These missiles are used to shoot down the alien invaders which are moving back and forth in rows dropping missiles toward the player's gun turret. Each alien defeated earns the player points toward their score. Every once in a while, a spaceship will fly across the top of the screen and shooting it will give the player extra points. The goal of the game is to clear the screen of Alien Invaders and score as many points as possible. The game ends when the player loses all three of their lives.  Their are 10 game options that can be chosen. They are: Game Number 1 = 1 player, 1 player missile, 2 alien missiles Game Number 2 = 1 player, 1 player missile, 4 alien missiles Game Number 3 = 1 player, 2 player missiles, 2 alien missiles Game Number 4 = 1 player, 2 player missiles, 4 alien missiles Game Number 5 = 2 players, 1 player missile, 2 alien missiles Game Number 6 = 2 players, 1 player missile, 4 alien missiles Game Number 7 = 2 players, 2 player missiles, 2 alien missiles Game Number 8 = 2 players, 2 player missiles, 4 alien missiles Game Number 9 = 2 players, 1 player missile, 2 alien missiles Game Number 10 = 2 players, 1 player missile, 4 alien missiles  Games numbered 5 through 8 have the players taking turns, while 9 and 10 have both players shooting at the aliens simultaneously. The number of missiles tell how many missiles are allowed to exist on screen at the same time. No more missiles can be fired until those missiles hit an object or leave the screen.
