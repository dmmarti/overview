Videocart-6 is a math game which focuses on addition and subtraction. The game presents a series of problems to solve; using the controller you need enter in the correct answer. A correct answer earns a point; if you enter an incorrect answer you are then given a second chance. Answer incorrectly a second time and then a point is given to the computer which will also show you how to solve the problem. These are the only variations featured within the game itself, however the instruction manual includes a variety of suggestions for games that can be played by two or more players. These include Mathematical Chairs (two players take turns seeing who can answer the most problems in a row), Math Maze (the manual features a maze drawn on a grid; answer a question correctly and you can move that many spaces, the first person through the maze wins), Hang Math (a variation of hang man; for each incorrect answer you draw a part of the body, too many wrong answers and your character is hung), Up to 1000 (answer problems correctly to add the value to your score; try to end up with 1000 points without going over), and several more.
