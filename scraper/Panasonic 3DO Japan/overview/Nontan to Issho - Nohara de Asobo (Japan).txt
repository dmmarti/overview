The first installment in the Nontan to Issho series is an edutainment game designed for preschoolers. Featuring the adorable cat Nontan and his friends, the game offers three different mini-games. Through interactive animated sequences, young players learn to tell the time, recognize the seasons and count. The game offers a visually appealing experience, enabling children to understand these concepts without needing to know how to read.
