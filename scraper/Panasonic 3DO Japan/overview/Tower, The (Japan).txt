The Tower, known as SimTower on other platforms, is a business sim where your objective is to construct a skyscraper that not only towers high but also boasts aesthetic appeal, popularity, and profitability. Unlike typical office or residential buildings, your tower must offer a diverse range of facilities, from penthouses to theaters, restaurants to shopping centers, to attract and cater to a wide array of tenants.
