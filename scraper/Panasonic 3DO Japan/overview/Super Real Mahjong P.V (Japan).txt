Super Real Mahjong PV is the fifth installment in the popular strip mahjong series. Set in a high school setting, players are introduced to three spirited girls - Mizuki, Aya, and Akira - who challenge them to a game of mahjong. The main gameplay mode features one-on-one mahjong matches, where each completed round results in the removal of a part of the girl's clothing.
