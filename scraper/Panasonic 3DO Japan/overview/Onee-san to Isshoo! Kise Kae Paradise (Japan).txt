In Kise Kae Paradise, players take on the role of a bachelor looking for companionship. They interact with three girls - Emi, Mai and Mari - in an attempt to establish a relationship. To initiate the relationship, players visit the home of the chosen girl and engage in a multiple-choice dialogue. The strength of the relationship depends on the dialogue choices, with good choices strengthening it and bad ones diminishing it. In addition, players have the opportunity to peek in on the girl in her bedroom, unlocking erotic video clips as a reward.
