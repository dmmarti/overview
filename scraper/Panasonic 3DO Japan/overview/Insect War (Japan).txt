Insecter War presents a psychedelic, sci-fi take on the Faceball 2000 style of first-person shooter. Matches are fast-paced, with a simple and direct form of combat: shoot or be shot, using simple and straightforward weapons. Stages are also filled with a variety of obstacles and traps, giving places for players and enemies alike to strafe through and hide from each other in. In the multiplayer battle mode, Insecter War can be played with up to four players in split-screen; it also offers a single-player campaign mode with a simple story.
