Kyuusei Senjutsu Niyoru Heisei Kaiun Koyomi is not exactly a game for 3DO; it's better categorized as entertainment software. It's somewhat akin to Bagua or the Book of Changes, serving as a sort of stargazing tool. By entering certain data about yourself or someone else, you can view astrological forecasts. This allows you to see auspicious and inauspicious days, zodiac compatibility with your significant other, and more.
