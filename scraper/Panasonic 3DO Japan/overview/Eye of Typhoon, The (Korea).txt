Like Fight Fever, The Eye of Typhoon plays similarly to other 2D versus fighting games. There are 12 playable fighters to choose from and two boss characters. The object of the game is to win two matches out of three. Each character has a set of moves in addition to two basic punches and kicks. Players also have the ability to taunt others, but unlike games such as SNK's Art of Fighting series, this has no effect and would actually leave the player open to attacks.
