Policenauts is a Japanese-style adventure with action elements, similar in many ways to Snatcher. The player interacts with the environment in a point-and-click fashion: positioning a cursor over an object allows the player character to examine it or perform other context-dependent actions. There are a few puzzles in the game, but most of the time the story is advanced by visiting various locations, examining objects, and talking to characters. Conversations usually include a selection of topics.
