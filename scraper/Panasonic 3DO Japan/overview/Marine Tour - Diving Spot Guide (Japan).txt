Marine Tour - Diving Spot Guide is a kind of virtual encyclopedia of diving. If you are planning to dive in the warm waters of the Indian and Pacific Oceans, the disc can be useful, although without knowledge of Japanese, half of the information will remain unintelligible. Thus, for divers, you will find information on the most famous dive sites, nearby cities, prices, and so on. Some places are covered in more detail - including bottom topography, depths and fish. You can even include voice-over narration. In 1994, it may have still been relevant, but today even the most dilapidated website will give you more information.
