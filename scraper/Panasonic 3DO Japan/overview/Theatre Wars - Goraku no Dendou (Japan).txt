Theatre Wars is an eccentric theatre management simulator. Divided into several stages, players are entrusted with running a theatre and putting on strange spectaculars to satisfy different requirements. Players have a budget to work within, which has to be spent on set design, dancers, and music selection. If their show performs well, players can make their budget back and then some - but if their show reviews poorly, they'll go bankrupt and might even see their theatre demolished to build a parking lot.
