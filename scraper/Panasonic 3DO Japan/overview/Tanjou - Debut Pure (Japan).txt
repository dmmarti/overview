Tanjō: Debut puts players in the role of a music agent, tasked with nurturing three potential stars. Players manage schedules, balance training and leisure, and strive to keep the girls happy while reducing stress. After training, players choose their girls' career paths, such as modeling or performing. Competing against rival agencies, players aim for success in various events. The 3DO release, Debut Pure, includes additional events like costume contests and fashion shows.
