The Oyaji Hunter is on a mission to save cute girls from indecent men. The story is presented with animated cutscenes. The actual fights between Oyaji Hunter and his opponents take the form of Mahjong matches. If the player gets a higher score in a turn, there is an opportunity to do a mini-game of chance which allows you to multiply the score which determines the amount damage you do to your opponent.
