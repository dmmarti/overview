ASCII's Kakinoki Shogi is a good 3DO implementation of the game of Go (Kakinoki is the last name of the game's director). You can play against another human, against an adjustable AI, or watch two AI's.  There are several game options, including spoken comments, displaying what moves the AI is considering, and time-limited play. You can save your game to resume later and display the moves backward and forward. Computer hints are available, and you can set up the board any way you want, or solve checkmating problems.  The graphics are simple, but effective, including three nice woodgrain boards.
