Treasure Island is an arcade adventure based on the Robert Louis Stevenson's book. You play the role of Jim Hawkins who has to get to Treasure Island, defeat pirates and defeat Long John Silver.

Jim must get on to a ship and avoid the enemies before being whisked off to Treasure Island. On the island Jim must encounter and avoid various pirates. Scattered on the island are cutlasses which can be used to kill pirates blocking his path. Beware though, cutlasses are limited so Jim doesn't want to waste them on any old pirate. Get hit by a cutlass or touched by a pirate and you lose a live sending you back to the start of the screen.

Search the island, find Long John Silver and become rich beyond your wildest dreams.
