The object of the game is to pick up patients from their homes and race them to the hospital. When a house flashes, that indicates a sick patient is present. Navigate to the house and press the fire button to pick the patient up. Then, drive through the city to get to the hospital. You have to avoid other cars on the road because they will not stop for you. On certain levels, there's a train that makes you sit and wait. You only have a limited amount of time to deliver your patients.
