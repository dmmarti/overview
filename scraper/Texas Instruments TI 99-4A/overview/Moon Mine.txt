Moon Mine is a shoot' em up where the player is the captain of the U.S.S. Recovery and has to capture treasure that has been stolen from Earth. The culprit is the evil Zygonaut who has hidden the treasures in a mine shaft in the centre of the moon. As the player descends down the mine shaft ten different creatures will appear that have to be destroyed. This is done with four lasers, one on each side of the screen. The creatures appear far down the shaft and move towards the player's guns. More points are earned by shooting them at a far distance.

Firing the lasers too much will lead to them overheating. They are cooled with water and at times it is necessary to replenish the water supply. Pools of water occasionally appear on the screen and the player then has to send out a crew member to retrieve it. The crew member can destroy monsters with a hand laser but it only has twelve shots. At times treasure (silver, jade and amethyst) will appear and it is collected in the same way.
