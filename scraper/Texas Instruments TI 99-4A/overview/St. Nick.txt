St. Nick was the first title Funware released after being bought out in the Summer of 1983 by Creative Software.

In 1983 there were as many as 3 companies interested in buying out Funware, those being Activision, Epyx, and Creative Software. As one might be able to tell from the box scan on this page, Funware was eventually sold to Creative Software. However, both Epyx and Activision would later give a go at marketing TI-99/4A games independently near the end of 1983.
