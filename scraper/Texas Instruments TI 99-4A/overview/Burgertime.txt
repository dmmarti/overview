In BurgerTime, you move your chef around the play field, walking over ingredients to build hamburgers. If an ingredient from a higher level falls on top of an ingredient on a lower level, the lower ingredient falls a level. This can "chain" so that an effective strategy is to try to build the burgers from the top down.nnnnGiving chase are hotdogs, pickles (which flicker badly in this version), and eggs. If an enemy is on an ingredient part as you make it drop, it tends to fall further than just a single level (and may in fact fall all the way to the bottom, taking any intervening ingredients with it). You can also drop ingredients on top of the enemies, which temporarily removes them from play.nnnnFailing that, you have a limited supply of pepper, which you can sprinkle on enemies to stun them for a short while. At limited times in the game, you can pick up an ice cream cone which replenishes your pepper supply by one "shake."
