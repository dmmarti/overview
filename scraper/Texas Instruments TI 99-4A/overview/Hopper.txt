Hopper is a game similar to the arcade game Pengo. The player is a kangaroo trying to escape from three circus trainers. The game is played on single screen levels each full of crates. The kangaroo can move around in all directions and push the crates in front of him. The three trainers move around the screen trying to catch the kangaroo and to defeat them crates have to be pushed onto them. To advance to the next level, all of the trainers have to be squished. The player has four lives and when they are all gone the game is over.
