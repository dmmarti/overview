ZeroZap is a fun game where a player launches an arrow and it bounces and reflects around the map scoring points.  Your goal is to determine the best path to launch your arrow to score the most points.  A lot of fun!

This game was part of the Milton Bradley Gamevision series, which consisted of 7 cartridges (Connect Four, Yahtzee, Hangman, Zero Zap, Card Sharp, Stratego, and the Gamevision Demonstration Cartridge ). These 7 cartridges were the launch titles for the TI-99/4 in 1979
