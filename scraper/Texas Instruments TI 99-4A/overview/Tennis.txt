You get to pick the level of play and whether your opponent is a human or a computer player. The rules of tennis are preserved including switching sides after each odd game, and the speech synthesizer does a nice job of announcing the score and any errors. Animations are clear with added touches such as ball boys running to get a ball near the net. You can control the way you hit the ball (forehand/backhand), the speed (smash/lob) and the direction via the joysticks.
