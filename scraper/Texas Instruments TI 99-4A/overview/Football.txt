This is a two-player simulation of football. It is not an action game, in that you do not directly control the players on the field. Instead, the offense and defense take turns selecting from a menu of plays (dive play, off tackle, hb sweep, fullback draw, screen right, flare pass, slant in, bomb, sideline pass, punt, field goal, and various defensive plays). The computer then simulates the action, based on actual pro football statistics.
