Drive your cattle along the famous Chisholm Trail in this top-down arcade-style game from TI. Use the keyboard or joysticks to maneuver your steer around the playing field. But watch out for rustlers who want to steal your cattle, and wranglers who want to put their own brands on your stock. Features 9 levels of difficulty.
