MunchMan is an arcade action game similar to Pac-Man. You control MunchMan who is in a maze; your goal is to lay down a chain throughout each path of the maze (the opposite of Pac-Man where you need to eat all of the dots). Also in the maze are four "Hoonos"; these creatures will be constantly chasing MunchMan, and if he's caught a life is lost. When all of MunchMans lives are lost, the game is over. To help out, each corner of the maze has a Texas Instruments (TI) logo; eat the TI logo and MunchMan will now temporarily be able to eat the Hoonos for bonus points! When the maze is complete, you move on to the next, more difficult level.
