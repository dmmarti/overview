Junkman Junior is a clone of the game Jumpman Junior. Your goal is to collect all of the junk on the screen so you can earn points and move on to the next level. There are various platforms, ladders, and ropes you will need to climb and jump your way around to reach the various items. From time to time, a bullet will fire at you from off of the screen; be sure to dodge this, otherwise one of your lives will be lost! Although this is primarily an action game, there is a strategy element to it as well, as you may need to figure out an optimal route to reach all of the items. When an item is collected, often there is a consequence on the screen, such as floors disappearing or deadly fires appearing; if you aren't careful, you could find yourself in a difficult situation! Each level has a different theme, and may also feature additional challenges such as moving ladders and falling firestones. There are eleven levels in total to complete.
