In Pole Position II, based on the arcade sequel to Pole Position, you are again driving an F-1 racer in a timed qualifying run, trying to achieve the pole position. Then it is off to the race, in hopes of taking that top spot. The difference in Pole Position II and it's predecessor is that now you have four tracks to select from.
