Meltdown is an arcade action game similar to Reactor. On the screen you will see a representation of a nuclear reactor; numerous control rods are located in the center of the screen, with the reactor walls around the edges. Inside the reactor are numerous (and dangerous) particles which will damage the control rods if they collide. Using the light gun, you need to shoot and destroy the various particles  before the control rods are destroyed. As the control rods take damage, the walls of the reactor will slowly cave inward, decreasing the amount of space available. From time to time power crystals may appear; if shot, these will provide bonuses such as extra points, control rod repair, temporarily freeze the particles, more powerful shots, and more. The game ends when the control rods have been completely destroyed causing the reactor to meltdown.
