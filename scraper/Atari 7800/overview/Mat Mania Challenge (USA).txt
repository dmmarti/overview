Tie up those wrestling boots and climb into the Atari 
Wrestling Federation Championship ring. Based on the Technos coin-op of 1985, Mat Mania challenge features two player head-to-head action, or a one player journey to the championship belt. Each match lasts three minutes. The object is to either outscore, pin, or get your opponent counted out. You can perform such moves as the Overhead Slam or the Piledriver and many more; but your opponent has the same abilities.
