also known as Blackjack: each round begins with a bet, and the goal is achieving the highest hand without going over the value sum of 21. The computer (dealer) and the player both draw cards, and then decide their move - hit or stand, or (for the player) double, split or surrender; when the dealer has an upturned ace, the player gets the option for an insurance bet. Gone broke? - the game ends, and shows you some statistics to review.
