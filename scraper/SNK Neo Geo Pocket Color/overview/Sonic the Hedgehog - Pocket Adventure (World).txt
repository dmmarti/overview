Take control of Sonic on the road with Sonic Pocket Adventure. Travel through 9 zones bashing robots and collecting rings. In addition to traditional Sonic gameplay this cartridge features Time Trial, Link Battle, and Puzzle modes. In puzzle mode the player can arrange "puzzle pieces" collected through the levels and unlock hidden pictures. To facilitate the on-again, off-again gameplay common in handhelds, you may restart your game on any unlocked zone or act. Similarly this game features multiple levels of difficulty and the option to turn off the standard 10 minute time limit on each level.
