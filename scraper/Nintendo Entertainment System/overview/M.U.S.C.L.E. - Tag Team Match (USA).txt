M.U.S.C.L.E. (Millions of Unusual Small Creatures Lurking Everywhere) is an early NES wrestling game based on the line of toys popular in the 1980s. M.U.S.C.L.E. allows you to choose two wrestling stars from the M.U.S.C.L.E. universe (from a selection of eight) in a tag-team match tournament in one player mode, and versus a friend in two player mode. Each wrestler has one special move that can be used by collecting the power pellet that floats around the ring at random instances.
