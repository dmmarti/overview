In a few words: Conquer all you can.
You have two options: Mongol conquest or World conquest. In the first campaign as Temujin (later known as Genghis Khan), you must unite all the little tribes of Mongolia. You can use force or diplomacy.
In the second campaign, you can be one of four characters. As in the first campaign, you must unite all the countries.
