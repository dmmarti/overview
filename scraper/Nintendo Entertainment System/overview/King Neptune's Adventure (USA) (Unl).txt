King Neptune's kingdom has been disturbed and turned into an evil underwater world. A dark tentacled creature has stolen his magical orb and eight other artifacts. Armed with bouncing lightshots and a limited amount of bubble bombs that can be detonated at your command, you need to guide Neptune through nine side-scrolling levels to recover the items.

Shoot specific types of enemies to gather health and bombs. The treasure can be recovered by beating bosses or with the help of royal dolphins. There is an adventure aspect as well, you need to collect keys to open specific doors and some items can only be accessed by solving another quest first. The final confrontation will lead you to the master creature's lair in the inner sanctum of Atlantis.
