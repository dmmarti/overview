Based on the 1985 Hong Kong movie, "Mr. Vampire", Phantom Fighter puts the player in the role of a Chinese warrior who walks with your pupil through several Chinese towns taken by phantoms. Enter each house and beat 'em up using a variety of kung-fu moves. After defeating a phantom, you'll receive a special gift that recovers your energy or enhances your fighting skills. During the game, you talk to different people who help you to understand what's going on.
