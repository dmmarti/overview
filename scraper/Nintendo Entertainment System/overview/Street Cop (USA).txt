One of the few NES games that uses the Power Pad. You play a cop who must chase down and catch the criminals. The game takes you through the streets of a city, where you must turn corners and keep running to catch the bad guys. You use the NES power pad to run through the streets, faster you run faster the cop will give chase. You use the controller to use your nightstick to apprehend the criminal.
