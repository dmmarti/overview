Based off the cartoon show of the same name, Attack of the Killer Tomatoes places young Chad Finletter on a quest to make his way past evil mutant tomatoes and stop the crazy Dr. Putrid T. Gangreen from unleashing his Doomsday Tomato. With all the citizens of San Zucchini terrified of the fanged vegetables coming from the sewers, Chad will be on his own to take on the tomato scourge. The doctor doesn't take him lightly, however, and has sent his special tomato squad, Zoltan, Beefstake, Mummato, Fang, Ketchuck and Tomacho, to stop him.

The game is a side-scrolling platform jumping game where the main method of stopping the killer tomatoes is to jump on them. From that they'll either splatter, run away or transform into smaller tomato bits. Energy Power-ups exist to refill Chad's health.
