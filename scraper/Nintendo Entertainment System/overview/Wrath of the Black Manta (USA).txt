The Big Apple is being overrun with crime, and the cities children have been mysteriously disappearing. It is up to the Black Manta to rescue the children and stop whomever is behind this. In addition to your ninja skills, you will be able to find additional powers (including invisibility and teleportation) to help you out against the numerous and well armed villians. Wrath of the Black Manta is a side scrolling arcade style action game with five different levels. Throughout each level you may come across various clues to help you find where to go next or lead you to a hidden location. Some of the bad guys you come across may also possess useful knowledge and can be interrogated (if they don't kill you first that is!)
