This unlicensed title contains three different games, not released separately: Sunday Funday, Fishfall and 4HIM: The Ride.

Sunday Funday is an adaptation of the game Menace Beach, and contains a changed storyline and some graphical changes. The storyline now deals with a boy trying to make his way to Sunday school. Gameplay consists of riding a skateboard through various obstacles and defeating enemies who try to hinder the player's progress.

Fishfall is a game where the player controls a hand trying to catch as many freefalling fish as possible and then throwing them upwards toward a moving basket in order to meet a quota.

4HIM: The Ride isn't a game per se, but a sing-a-long of a song by Christian pop band 4Him.
