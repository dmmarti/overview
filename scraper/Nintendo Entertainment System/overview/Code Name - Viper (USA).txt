Set against the backdrop of the war on drugs from the late 1980s/early 1990s, Code Name: Viper directly confronts the drug cartel at their bases in South America. You play an American secret agent who must infiltrate the cartel drug bases and mansions, free hostages and informants, and piece together clues about who the kingpin is-- and inevitably bring him down. Equip yourself with a progressively more powerful arsenal as the game progresses in standard NES side-scroller fashion.
