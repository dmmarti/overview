After the death of the evil wizard Malkil, he has returned.
You are the mightiest warrior of them all, Kuros. And you have been summoned to the land of Sindarin to destroy Malkil "again".
Malkil has now taken the shape of the four elements, water, wind, air and fire. To destroy the wizard this time you have to collect the shattered pieces of the Legendary Ironsword throughout the world of Sindarin. There exist four animal kings in the land and they will help you in your quest.
