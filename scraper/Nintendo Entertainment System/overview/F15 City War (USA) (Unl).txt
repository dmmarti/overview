F-15 City War is arcade style action game. You fly an F-15 with unlimited ammunition into battle against tanks, helicopters, gun boats, missile silos, jets, robots,  and a large boss at the end of each of five levels. Gameplay alternates between two perspectives, a 3-D view from behind your plane and a top down scrolling view.
