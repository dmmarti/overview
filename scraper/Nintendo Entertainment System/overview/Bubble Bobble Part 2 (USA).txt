Cubby and Rubby, descendants of Bub and Bob from the original Bubble Bobble, must rescue their friend Judy, who has been kidnapped by the evil Skull Brothers!

The game plays much like the original game: You use a dinosaur that spits bubbles at their enemies, trapping them until you touch the bubbles to make them pop and defeat the trapped enemies. But Cubby and Rubby have two skills their ancestors did not: by holding down the attack button, they can float upwards - and by releasing it, they'll fire several bubbles at once. They can also pick up special items that increase their points, speed and attack power. This game features 80 levels, all-new enemies, and bonus mini-games.
