You are Mad Max. You drive your Interceptor through the post-apocalyptic wastelands and fight bandits.
The game introduction is the speech from the beginning of the movie Mad Max 2 (a.k.a The Road Warrior), telling you how the world ended and how The Road Warrior, lost everything by "the roar of an engine" and how he in the wastelands "learned to live again".
The game is played in a top-down view where you move your car to attack enemy cars and pick up fuel tanks (if run run out of fuel the game is over).
