As Gizmo, you must reach the Gremlin Control Centre to wipe them out. This is an isometric action game differing from the Elite title. You can gain items such as a bow and arrow and matches after each level to help. Mr Wing's Shop also contains many goodies, so watch out for its door magically appearing. Hazards include spiders, electrified wires, ground-mounted hazards, and a boss at the end of each level.
