You are Astyanax, a sixteen year old boy that has the same dream night after night: A princess, calling for help. One afternoon, you are summoned to the world of Remnia by Cutie, a pixie, to save the realm's princess. You are the chosen one mentioned by their prophecies!

Yes, this is your typical fantasy story setting. You must save the realm from Blackhorn's evil horde! Along the way you'll find powerups that will make you stronger, and upgrade your weapon; and you can also unleash magical attacks that hit all enemies on the screen.
