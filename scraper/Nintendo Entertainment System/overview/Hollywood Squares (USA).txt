This is a GameTek conversion of the '80s version of the game show Hollywood Squares.  Two contestants play a version of tic-tac-toe, with "celebrities" filling in for the squares. The selected celeb is asked a question, answers it, and the contestant must agree or disagree with their answer. A correct guess captures that square.  After three games, the winning contestant picks a key and a car out of two separate pools, hoping to match the two up and win the car.
