Sword Master establishes the tale of an evil wizard in league with a monstrous demon who have dared to kidnap a damsel. The Sword Master is a knight who seeks to rescue the fair lady and destroy the evil people and creatures in the castle in which they dwell.

It is a parallax side-scrolling action game in which the player must use sword and shield to battle through 7 game levels, from the forest, to a cursed town, to multiple levels of the villain's castle lair. The player will encounter giant bats, wolves, skeleton warriors, evil knights, wizards, lizard men, gargoyles, and other fierce enemies on his quest. The Sword Master can swing his sword, defend with his shield, and gather power-ups which enable him to change his form; for example, the Sword Master can transform into a magic user himself and cast offensive magic spells.
