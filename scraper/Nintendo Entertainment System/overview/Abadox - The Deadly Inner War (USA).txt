Somewhere in the galaxy, a huge alien space creature known as Parasitis travels between realms digesting it's pray. It's latest victim is the planet Abadox which is now consumed by the alien entity. However, in order to digest this planet, Parasitis has had to assume to form of the planet itself. Abadox's starfleet, the World Alive Force (WAF) uses this time to launch an all out assault on the alien lifeform, of which you are a single soldier.

Abadox is a side-scrolling shooter. You must fire upon various enemies that travel across the screen and destroy their bosses as well. One button controls your shooting and another controls your shield ability.
