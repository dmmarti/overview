The evil sorcerer Darces took over our world once again. The only way to defeat him is to find five elemental swords and to combine them into the ultimate weapon which is the only possibility to destroy the villain. Naturally, you, the nameless hero, are the one who is chosen to go on this dangerous journey. 

"Dungeon Magic" is a first-person RPG that looks similar to  Wizardry games, but instead of the usual turn-based combat you fight your enemies in real time, parrying to avoid their blows and attacking physically or casting offensive magic to hurt them. You explore large outdoor areas, towns, and dungeons, and specialize in five kinds of magic.
