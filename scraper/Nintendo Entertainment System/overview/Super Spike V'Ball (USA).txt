Based on the lesser-known V'Ball coin-op, Super Spike V'Ball challenges players to bump, set, and spike their way to a beach volleyball championship. Teams of two travel the USA and the world, visiting venues like Chicago, Los Angeles, Hawaii, and Australia. This game can be played by 1-4 players simultaneously, although an NES Satellite or NES Four Score device (and extra controllers) are required for three or four players.
