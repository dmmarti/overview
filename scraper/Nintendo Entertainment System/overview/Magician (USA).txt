Merlwood was once a land of peace and prosperity. The people lived in harmony with one another and with their surroundings, thanks to the benevolent influence of the native wizards and their magical arts. All was calm until one ambitious wizard named Abadon began to lust for power. Abadon overwhelmed the other wizards, brought evil upon the land, and made himself its master. Only Paul, a young magician's apprentice, was left to oppose him. Can you guide Paul to victory, or will Abadon rule Merlwood forever? 

Magician is a 2D, side-scrolling action RPG. As Paul, you must travel through towns, have conversations with non-player characters, acquire and manage inventory (food, water, weapons, potions, etc.), learn magic spells, fight battles, and solve puzzles. Your ultimate goal: collect each of the four elemental vials -- earth, air, fire, and water -- and combine them to create the Ultimate Potion. Only then can you hope to vanquish the evil wizard Abadon!
