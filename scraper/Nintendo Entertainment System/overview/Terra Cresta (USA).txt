In the follow-up to Moon Cresta, a well-guarded planet is being invaded. You will have to make a succession of passes over the landscape, shooting out ground turrets and aliens. Numbered bases release power-ups when shot - these can either be used in combination or (by pressing the space bar) in Formation Mode, covering a wider range of shooting positions. Each pass over the planet ends with a boss; the third and final one with a boss who can only be killed if you are at maximum power. Death puts you back to the start of the world.
