Goku and Nora (Bulma) are on a quest to find seven crystal balls. By finding all of these crystal balls, the Dragon Emperor will grant them one wish. It won't be easy though, there are rumors of a mysterious army that is also looking for them.

Dragon Power is a game based on the Dragon Ball anime in japan (though a lot of it is lost in translation). Goku can jump, attack or release a powerful wind wave to stop his enemies. Much of the game is an overhead view, though occasionally Goku will have to fight in a side view. Different power ups will increase his powers and techniques, letting stronger abilities flourish.
