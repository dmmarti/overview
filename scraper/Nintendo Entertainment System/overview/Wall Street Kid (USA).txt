Your distant uncle has passed away, leaving you, his heir, with a fortune of billions of dollars. The catch? The Benedict family has extremely high standards, and you have to prove that you can make that fortune even larger on the stock market before it will be given to you. In addition, you must exercise regularly to stay healthy, and keep your girlfriend happy by pampering her frequently with gifts. 

The game features a stock trading engine that is fairly simple to jump into. Buy stocks as you see fit, and finish the day. The next morning, you will find out whether your assets grew or not. If they didn't, you most likely need to invest in something else.
