Based on the popular Merv Griffin-produced TV game show of the same name. The goal is to solve for the missing letters in the given place, person, thing, phrase, etc. Spin the eponymous wheel for money, guess consonants, buy vowels, and try to solve the puzzle. Watch out, though...one poor spin, and you could be forced to miss your turn, or even go bankrupt. Play against human opponents or the computer and win fabulous prizes on the WHEEL...OF...FORTUNE!
