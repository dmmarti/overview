In Laser Invasion you are trying to stop the enemy from deploying a new type of super weapon while saving a captured undercover agent.

The game is a compilation of familiar types of gameplay. The first stage is a helicopter aerial battle similar to Top Gun. The second stage is a first person side-scrolling shooter like Operation Wolf. The third stage is a maze hunt with influences from Golgo 13.

The game plays out in four levels.
