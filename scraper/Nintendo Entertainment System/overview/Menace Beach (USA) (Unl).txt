In Menace Beach, you play as a random guy whose girlfriend was kidnapped by Demon Dan on her way to meet you at the malt shop. To free her, you must travel on a skateboard thorough multiple town and sewer levels and battle evil clowns, Elvis impersonators, and randomly appearing Ninjas. 

To help, and sometime hinder you, a man randomly throws ketchup bottles, wrenches, and bombs out of widows and random holes in the sewer walls. These items can be picked up and thrown at your enemies to defeat them far better than your fists ever will.
