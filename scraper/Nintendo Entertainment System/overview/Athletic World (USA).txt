This "Family Fun Fitness" game consists of a series of competitive sporting events that requires the use of the Nintendo Power Pad.

One of a few games that attempt to combine physical exercising into a video gaming experience; you will be able to try many events such jumping hurdles, running up hills, log hopping, river rafting (standing on a raft and dodging/jumping branches) and more.

Athletic world offers three modes of play, training, beginner, and expert.  This is also one of the few Nintendo games that asks you to enter in your name, age, gender, and current date before playing.
