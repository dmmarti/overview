Metal Fighter is an arcade style shooter for one player. You control an MCS-920 in an attempt to free planet H17 from alien invaders. Along the way you can improve your fighters weapons and speed by shooting certain enemies and collecting the power ups left behind. Improved weapons don't come easy though; each time you collect a weapon power up you will need to fight another metal fighter and win to be able to claim the new weapon. Each of the numerous, colorful levels contains a variety of enemies trying to stop you, along with a large boss at the end that will need to be defeated before moving on.
