Wrecking Crew is a platform action game for one or two players. You control Mario and Luigi who need to demolish various buildings. After each wall in the building has been destroyed, you move on to the next (and more difficult) building. Many of the buildings have a puzzle element to them; you may need to find the path to reach all of the walls without becoming trapped at a dead end. Wandering throughout the buildings are dangerous creatures and the construction foreman, all of whom will stop Mario and Luigi from completing their task. The game features 100 levels, or use the construction set and create and play your own buildings.
