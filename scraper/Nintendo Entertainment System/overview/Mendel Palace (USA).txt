In Mendel Palace, you are Bun-Bun and you have to rescue your girlfriend Candy, who has fallen asleep and is now trapped in her dream. To progress, you have to go through various areas that feature dolls as enemies. Games are played on a board of 7x5 sliding tiles, using an overhead view. By sliding floor tiles, you'll be able to put them off balance and make the crash in the wall, leading to their destruction.
