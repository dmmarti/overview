Tom Sawyer's famous literary exploits come to life in this adventure where you play Tom Sawyer (or Huck Finn in a 2 player game).  The adventure begins in Tom's dream while he sleeps in school.

Control in this typical platform game consists of jumping and throwing rocks.  Avoid many obstacles such as rolling barrels; defeat persistent enemies such as pirates, mice, and even a giant octopus.  Help Tom navigate down the Mississippi River, through forests, haunted houses, and the sky above.
