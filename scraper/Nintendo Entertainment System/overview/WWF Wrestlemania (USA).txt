WWF Wrestlemania is the WWF's (now WWE) first foray into the Nintendo Entertainment System. This game puts you in the boots of the biggest stars of the time such as Andre The Giant, Hulk Hogan, and Randy Savage. Each of the six wrestlers has his own special strengths and abilities.

You choose from several different ways to play including Tournament action where you pick the wrestler of your choice and then battle the other five in timed matches. If you've got two to six players you can go for the best tournament action. The wrestler with the most wins at the end of the Tournament is the champ and gets to wear the coveted solid-gold WWF Championship Title.
