This cartridge used the power pad and contained two games: "Short Order", is a Simon-like game in which you are given an order and need to make the burger exactly as the order says. "Eggsplode" is a game in which you must destroy bombs that a fox is placing underneath chicken nests before they explode without destroying the chickens or their eggs.
