The Young Indiana Jones Chronicles is based on the television series of the same name, which is in turn based on the Lucas/Spielberg movie franchise starring Harrison Ford. In this game, a young Indiana Jones embarks on globetrotting adventures in which he gathers treasure and fights for what is good and right.

The game features side-scrolling action where young Indy trots along the ground, jumps, crawls flat, and can collect and wield a variety of weapons against copious enemies in the game. Indy starts with a whip and can find such weapons as throwing knives, grenades, pistols, rifles, and others. He can also collect hat powerups which allow him to sustain more damage.
