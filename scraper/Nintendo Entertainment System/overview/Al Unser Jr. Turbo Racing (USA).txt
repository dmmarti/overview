Play as legendary Indy Car driver Al Unser Jr., or create your own character, as you race through four cities. From behind the car, you'll be racing against other drivers to try to gain the Pole Position. Practice in time trials or go for the real thing. Controls use the A button to accelerate and Up and Down on the gamepad to switch gears.
