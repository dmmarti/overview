In this side-scrolling action game, you play as Wolverine, stranded on a remote island by Sabretooth and Magneto, and must fight your way through nine missions, ultimately concluding with battles against Sabretooth and Magneto. Along the way, fellow X-Men Havok, Psylocke and Jubilee can be called upon to aid Wolverine in certain situations. Of course, you can always utilize your adamantium claws and healing factor when the going gets tough.
