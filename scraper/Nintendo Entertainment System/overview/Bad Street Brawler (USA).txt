Side-scroller in which you get to beat up innocent people. Although it's seems kind of strange, the game is just that: walk around the street as a wrestler wannabe and beat up grannies, blind men, gorillas and other bystanders. But try not to get beaten as the granny attempts to give you some of your own medicine by flailing her purse at you.

Kicks and punches are your basic moves at first, but as the game progresses and you advance levels, new moves and attacks become available, and new people to beat up as well. It's public mayhem way before the likes of Grand Theft Auto.
