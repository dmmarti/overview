Sutekh has gotten rid of local superhero Vortex, and now Metro City is in the hands of crime. You are Nightshade - the superhero that nobody knows - and your goal is to stop the evil doers, including main villain Sutekh.

Nightshade is a humorous adventure game, with a fairly easy to learn mode of gameplay, using a well crafted menu to do various actions such as: look, take, talk, etc. Also included are some one on one fight scenes, which differ from the standard controls and in which Nightshade is able to jump, kick, punch and duck.
