Professor Plum and his designs for the "doomsday device", DEAD END have been taken by the diabolical LAWBREAKERS - a sinister group dedicated to the destruction of mankind. It's only a matter of time before the device is assembled and the final countdown begins. 
As Sergeant Billy "Big Bang" Blitz of the special Assault Brigade for Real Emergencies(S.A.B.R.E) your mission is to foil the LAWBREAKERS plan. To do this, you must find the shortest route to the summit of Demonhead mountain, where the professor is being held. Rescue the professor and save the world from total destruction. 
This is a "typical" sidescroller with Role playing elements. the various enemies you meet with leave behind cash which can then be used to buy equipment. You'll need a diving suit to swim underwater, a jetpack to get to those hard to reach areas and don't forget the shop card that can be used to call the shop no matter where you are.
