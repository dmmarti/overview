The Bugs Bunny Birthday Blowout takes place as Bugs is invited to his 50th birthday. Because some of the other Warner Bros. toons weren't invited (including Wile E. Coyote), they decided to stop Bugs from going to this party.

A Warner Bros licensed game, The Bugs Bunny Birthday Blowout is a 2d side-scrolling platform game. Bugs can jump over and on some enemies and try to collect as many carrots as possible. Bugs can use his hammer in order to smash enemies as well as to find some secrets.
