Barbie has a big day tomorrow, so she needs to get a good nights rest.  She has strange dreams about all her planned activities.  She must traverse five levels made up of a total of thirteen stages to make it through the night.

Barbie travels through various location in the mall, at the beach and in the soda shop trying to make it from the left side of each level to the right.  Each level is populated with animals and with living objects of the sort you would find in that location.  She can jump with the A button and throw crystals with the B button.  The longer you hold the button down, the farther each crystal is thrown.  She has three kinds of crystals, each of which has a different effect.  One makes creatures help her, one defeats them and one has varying effects.
