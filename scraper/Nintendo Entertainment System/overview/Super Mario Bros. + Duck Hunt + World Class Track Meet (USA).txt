If you bought a Nintendo Entertainment System Power Set, which came with two controllers, a Zapper light gun and a Power Pad, then you got this three-games-in-one cartridge, including:

1. Super Mario Bros.: the Princess has been kidnapped by the evil Bowser, and it is up to Mario and brother Luigi to save the day.

2. Duck Hunt: in Duck Hunt you need to use the Nintendo's light zapper to shoot ducks which your trusty dog scares out of the swamp.

3. World Class Track Meet: this is a track and field game for up to six players requiring the Power Pad.
