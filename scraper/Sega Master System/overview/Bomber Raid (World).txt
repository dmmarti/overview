Fly your plane through five levels, shooting enemy planes, submarines, helicopters, and other enemies along the way, and use your equipped cluster bombs if necessary. You need to destroy a target that is outlined in your mission briefing. You have three lives and limited cluster bombs. To help you along the way, you can shoot a power pod 
to score points, increase your firepower, and gain some help from fellow squadrons.
