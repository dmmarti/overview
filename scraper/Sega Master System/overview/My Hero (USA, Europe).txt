Rescue your girlfriend from the clutches of an evil gang in this extremely unforgiving side-scrolling beat-em-up. The eponymous hero can only jump-kick and punch and must fight numerous thugs, pigs, bulldogs and frogs on his way to the gang's leader, Mohikan. The game, an arcade conversion, was released originally on Master System card format.
