Based on the "anime" and laser tag game, Zillion is a game where the hero, J.J., must rescue his friends Apple and Champ from the alien race Noza. To get past certain rooms in the base, you must use codes which you can obtain by blowing up certain metal crates to get pieces of the code. Other items you can obtain are specs (which lets you see lasers that, if you trip up, alerts the area and sends reinforcements), bread and Opa-Opas (which level you up).
