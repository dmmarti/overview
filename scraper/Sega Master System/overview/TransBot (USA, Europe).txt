Back in the solar year 2000 there was a nuclear war, and people are finally now emerging from underground to build a new society. But something is still wrong. DALAUS, a leftover computer from the old world is creating its own empire, and it is up to you to stop it. To complete this mission you will pilot a CA-214 (the TransBot), a new experimental astro-plane. TransBot is a side scrolling shooter for one or two players. There are a wide variety of enemies you will need to get past to be victorious throughout the many locations. The CA-214 can have different types of weapons to help out. You start out with a basic, default gun, but after collection a ? symbol you can choose a new weapon to use. There are six choices which will scroll past at the top of the screen, and your TransBot will be powered with whatever selection you make. Powered up weapons will only last for a limited amount of time before the TransBot reverts back to the basic weapon.
