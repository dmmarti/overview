A new arcade has hit town, and Alex and his friends decide to check it out. Sadly, they have no idea where it is, so it's up to Alex to find the eight map pieces cleverly hidden inside the castle. 

Getting all the pieces is only the start, he must then fight his way through a forest filled with ninja assassins, enter town to do required tasks, obtain a travel pass, then get through a second forest filled with other nasties. The question is: will Alex make his way to the arcades before 17:00?

Alex Kidd: High-Tech World allows you to resume a saved game. All you have to do is enter a password, and the game will be resumed right where you left off. The game is time-based, and events can only happen at certain times. For instance, certain characters will appear when thirty minutes of each hour is up. 

During the game, you can access a status screen, which helps you keep track of the time, what floor you're on, and how many map pieces you collected so far. There are six floors inside the castle, including the attic. On some floors, there are phones which you can use to either to ask a character for help, or order a pizza. There are also alternate solutions to some puzzles in the game. The demo at the start of the game may give away one of the map pieces.
