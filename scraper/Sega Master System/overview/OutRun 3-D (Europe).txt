This edition of the classic driving game takes the original and adds a 3D view, using the Master System's 3D glasses. Little else is modified. You still drive a red Ferrari on a road which forks into more and more levels. The main differences are the levels, which look slightly different, the fact that your Ferrari is slightly smaller than the original Master System conversion, and that there are three new sound tracks to choose from; Midnight Highway, Color Ocean and Shining Wind. The original Magical Sound Shower is still left for the traditionalists.
