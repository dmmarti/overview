This game is the very first installment in the long-lived Phantasy Star series. It is a futuristic RPG that uses a turn-based combat system (viewed from first-person perspective). An unusual feature of this game is that some locations are also viewed from first-person perspective. You can explore those locations by moving forward or backward, and the environments are in pseudo-3D.
