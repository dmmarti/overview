Using your Sega Light Phaser, you are given a specified length of time to shoot as many targets as you can before the music fades out. The targets include birds, balloons, blimps, balls, and spaceships; some difficult, some not so difficult. As you progress through the rounds, the game gets difficult. For example, in Levels 3 &amp; 4, you have to shoot balls that pass through a set of pipes and come out the other end, and on Level 5, you can't shoot the spaceships if they are protected by a shield, and have to wait until the shield disappears, but not for long. The game ends when you don't shoot enough targets.
