Your comrades are wounded and stranded on the battlefield.  The only way to get to them, is via a handcart on a railroad track.  Your job is to protect the medics, who are riding the rails to get to the wounded.  In their path, are hordes of enemies on the ground and in the air shooting everything from fireballs to rockets.  In addition to the chaos, there are land-mines lying on the track just waiting to be run over.
