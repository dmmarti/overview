Two games  on one cartridge:

Pit Pot: The Magical Castle
The princess has been kidnapped. To rescue her, navigate your way through each room while avoiding its inhabitants such as dragons and guards. If necessary, use your magical hammer to knock them off the screen. You can also knock a gray tile that they are on to cause them to fall down and die. You exit each room by passing through doors, but you have to find a golden key that will unlock some of them. 

Astro Warrior
Blast your way through three zones, including Galaxy Zone, Asteroid Zone, and Nebula Zone. Enemies will start making their way down the screen, but you only have bullets to deal with them. There are flashing points on the terrain in which you can shoot at, Shooting enough of these will cause a number of green ships, which when destroyed, will upgrade your firepower. At the end of each zone, you come face to face with a boss, and it is likely that you are going to need that extra firepower.
