Superman: The Man of Steel is a side-scrolling platform game in which the player takes on the role of Superman.

A lot is wrong in the game: Lois Lane has been kidnapped by Brainiac, the Doom Star is orbiting the Earth and many deadly adversaries are roaming about. It's up to Superman to set everything right again.

As Superman the player has limited energy which is depleted when Superman comes in contact with enemies or their projectiles. Superman can jump, and attack. When Superman almost drops from a building he automatically starts flying. There's three different difficulty settings.
