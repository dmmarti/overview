Using a top-down view, Tennis Ace lets you play single or double games with computer players. Two human players can either duel or work cooperatively in a doubles game. By working your way to one of the six grand slam finals, with practice games and exhibition matches, you gain experience, which improves your playing style.

All the basic strokes are available: serves (either flat or a lob - fast-low, slow-high and curved), smashes, drop shots, lobs, flat forehands and backhands. Upon serving, the screen switches to a side-view and you have to time the throw and the hit to perform a succesful serve.

The in-game progress can be saved with a password function.
