As Teddy Boy, you must use your gun to shoot at enemies that come out of the boxes that are scattered around the level. You have limited time to do this. The number of enemies that come out of these boxes depends on the number being shown on the face. When you shoot enemies, they turn into little balls which you quickly need to collect. If you do not, the balls will be transformed into little creatures that eat away time. Once you have destroyed all enemies, you advance to the next level. when you stand in the same spot for too long, the floor will disintegrate, causing you to fall down to the below platform. From time to time, you will play a bonus game, where the object is to shoot boxes that contain a toy. In these rounds, you also must avoid shooting a box that contains a little creature or you lose time.
