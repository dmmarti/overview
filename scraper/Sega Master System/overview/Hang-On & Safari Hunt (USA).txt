Two games on one cartridge.

1. Hang-On - 
Similar to Pole Position, but with bikes. Race against time while trying to get past your opponents. Beating the clock will extend the time and provides a new backdrop.

Safari Hunt - 
Use your Sega Light Phaser to shoot as many wildlife as you can until you run out of ammunition. If your score is above the qualifying score by the time it runs out, you proceed to the next round. If it is not, you lose.
