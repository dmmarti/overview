Wimbledon II is a tennis game based on the championship with the same name.  The game features two modes: Free Match allows for singles or doubles games and supports one or two players. Tour Mode puts the player on the road, playing the best in the world for the championship cup. Players may create their own characters and save the progress via a password system. Three kinds of surfaces are available: hard, lawn, and clay; all of which affect the ball’s behaviour.
