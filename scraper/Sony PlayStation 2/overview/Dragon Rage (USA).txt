 Take to the skies as Cael Cyndar, the powerful and heroic dragon, in Dragon Rage's 15 action-packed single-player levels and eight unique and fully interactive environments. The third-person perspective features full free-flight controls and 20 individual Cael animations, including loops, barrel rolls, and other tricks. There are over 40 unique enemy units, include Orc Air Units, Orc Ground Units, and Orc Water Units, and a new engine that can draw 80,000 polygons at 60fps, with full scene anti-aliasing, creates expansive world landscapes. An enhanced particle system allows complex physics-based motions with items such as explosions, flowing water, and lava, and the IK animation system allows more natural character animation.
