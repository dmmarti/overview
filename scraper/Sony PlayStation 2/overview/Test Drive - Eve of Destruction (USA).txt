 Modeled on real thrill-show events across America, TD:EOD is a wild racing game with an authentic grassroots flavor.  From destruction derbies to suicide races, you can race authentic rust-buckets in a variety of rural tracks.  Smashing other racers is rewarded, and the computer opponents will try to smash you as well!  Try to complete a full career, starting out with your mom's junk car, racing local goof-balls in crazy races.  A wiseacre announcer provides local flavor, as you and your pals take a school bus over a tremendous jump, and the crowd goes wild!
