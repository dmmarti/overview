 Kingdom Heart Re:Chain of Memories is the PS2 remake of the GBA game Kingdom Hearts: Chain of Memories. It was initially released as a part of Kingdom Hearts II: Final Mix+ and only later made available as a standalone game.  The most important change is that the world and battles are now in full 3d, including voice acting and a full soundtrack. Basic gameplay elements such as the battle system based on cards remain identical, but with additions such as the Reaction Command from Kingdom Hearts II. There are also a number of new cutscenes and entirely new battles, such as the fight with Zexion in Reverse/Rebirth. Upon completing the game, all cutscenes can be viewed in chronological order in the Theater Mode.
