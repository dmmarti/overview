 The Incredible Hulk faces against his greatest adversary - the Abomination - in a free-roaming, open world action adventure.  Every object is interactive, plus you can also wield the power of 'weaponization', whereby you can create new weapons from everyday objects.  As the most powerful creature on earth, take the battle from the city to the badlands, smash six classic Marvel bosses and finally defeat the Devil Hulk inside your mind.
