 Choose your favorite Antz character and race towards the finish line.  You can drive the backs of larger bugs, run by foot, fly on the backs of flying bugs, or surf on a leaf.  Each character has eight types of races they must take on.  Collect powerups and take out your opponents.  4 player split screen allows you to play with your friends (except on GBA where you can play 2 players with the link cable).
