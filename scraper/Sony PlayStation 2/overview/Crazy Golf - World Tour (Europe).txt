 Crazy Golf World Tour is a mini golf game for up to four players. The game is in full 3D and features a number of perspectives from which the game can be viewed. Default is a behind the back perspective but this can be changed to a top down perspective for better overview of the course. The PC version is controlled by the mouse, both to aim and to swing with the club. Moving the mouse back and forth quickly will result in a hard shot.  The game's courses all have different obstacles like water hazards, slopes, jumps and moving objects. There's three courses in total, each with 18 holes. Each course has its own theme, be it the Wild West, Ghost World or Pirates Cove. The game has four game modes. In career the player has to achieve as many pars as possible to unlock the next course. In tournament the player has to complete the course in the lowest number of shots. In speed golf the player plays against the clock. Last, in the practice mode the player can play any unlocked course just for the fun of it.
