 Based on the original Mobile Suit Gundam series, this game has you choose which side to lead into victory from two different sides.  There are multiple modes to choose from, including a campaign mode and versus mode. You can either fight for the Earth Federation or the Zeon Forces as you play the campaign mode, which has over 200 missions to pick from. Finish these missions by destroying enemy mechs and completing objectives while you explore a 3D landscape. If you successfully complete these missions you will be able to upgrade your mobile suits and increase your selection of suits you can take into battle.  In versus mode you can play with a friend in split screen versus or team battle action, using the suits you unlock in the campaign mode.  This game also features actors from the TV series, to provide voiceovers from the Gundam world.
