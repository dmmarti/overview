 Bombastic, the sequel to Devil Dice, is a puzzle game where you attempt to clear a field of explosive dice. To set the dice off, you must roll the top face of the die you're standing on next to the same number of interconnected die with the same face (i.e. connect five 5's, four 4's). After a set period of time, the dice will explode, igniting any dice that the explosion touches that either match the number, or are one lower. This game is very fast-paced - you have to keep moving, because if you're on top of an exploding die, you get knocked out and you lose the game.  There are several modes of play in Bombastic - Trial Mode, where you try to clear 100 levels; Story Mode, where you progress through stages trying to solve preset puzzles and fight bosses, and Battle Mode, where you fight against four opponents and try to stay alive as long as you can. In addition to the standard Bombastic mode, you can also unlock classic Devil Dice mode, where the dice sink into the ground instead of exploding.
