 In "Eternal Ring", you play Cain Morgan, a member of the Royal Security Force, who has been given an assignment from the king  - he must investigate a mysterious island called No Return. Somewhere on this island there must be a ring that possesses eternal power. But Cain does not know that the island also holds the clue to his own past...  "Eternal Ring" is a real time action RPG. There are day and night cycles on the island of No Return, and most objectives can be completed only during a particular time. Cain will be able to upgrade his sword during the adventure, find powerful rings (used for attack or for defense), and make his own rings by combining empty bands with gems. The combat is real time, viewed from 1st person perspective.
