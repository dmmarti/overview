 Cabela's North American Adventures introduces fresh touches that hunters will appreciate, including a custom gun builder that allows players the ability to create thousands of gun options with a variety of receivers, stocks, barrels, and scopes. The game also capitalizes on the popularity of hunting shows and online videos by adding a cameraman into gameplay - to get compelling footage, hunters need to be at their best! Also, for the first time in franchise history, up to four friends can hunt together online at once (Xbox 360 and PlayStation 3). Once the hunt is done, friends can share their scores through online leader boards for bragging rights.
