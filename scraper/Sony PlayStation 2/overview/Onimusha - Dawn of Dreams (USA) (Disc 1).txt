 The Onimusha series continues two decades after the fall of Nobunaga by Samanosuke. Hideyoshi Toyotomi is now leader of a united Japan. He resurrects the Genma and a new hero named Soki rises to the challenge. The game is told through various CGI cutscenes spanning 2 DVDs and 17 Stages. Besides Soki, multiple characters can be played (5 in total), all with their different style of fighting. Soki uses swords, Jubei uses blades, and Ohatsu uses projectiles. The gameplay is faster paced and more of a real-time RPG feel. You can now lock on enemies instead of button mashing like the original games. Cooperative puzzles have been added to the series. In addition, a 360-degree camera is now available.
