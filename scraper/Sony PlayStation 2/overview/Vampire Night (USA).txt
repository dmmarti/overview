 The legend has existed for centuries. Very few have survived to tell their account of terror. But we know, the Vampire is real. Grab a friend and the GunCon2 and experience the bone-chilling shoot'em up action. Namco puts you in the role of the vampire hunter. Improved over the arcade version, Vampire Night for the PlayStation 2 computer entertainment system also includes a special training mode, an adventure mode, and other hidden features for players to unlock.  Can be purchased with or without the GunCon 2.
