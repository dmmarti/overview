 SingStar Singalong with Disney is a karaoke game featuring the most famous hits from Disney movies, from Tarzan to Sleeping Beauty without forgetting Aladdin or Peter Pan.  The game gives points which are distributed by the purity of singing, as in how well does one manage to stay on tune. It doesn't matter if you change octaves in the middle of the song or what words are you singing in (it doesn't have a word recognition), so your singing is rated by how well you manage to hit the correct note at the correct time.  If the tracklist is the same for all the European countries, the songs are in the local language except for some like Norway for example.  Here is the tracklist:  1. 101 Dalmatians - Cruella De Vil 2. Aladdin - A Whole New World 3. The Aristocats - Ev'rybody Wants To Be A Cat 4. Beauty And The Beast - Beauty And The Beast 5.
