 Tenkaichi 2 is a fighting game with more than 120 playable characters, the biggest amount ever featured in a Dragon Ball game. The main Dragon Adventure mode follows an epic story mode that covers the first Dragon Ball Z saga (Saiyan Saga) right up to the last Dragon Ball GT saga (Dragon Saga), including all of the major battles, making it one of the most comprehensive Dragon Ball Z games.  The same battle format from the predecessor is taken, but extended with improved mechanics, including the return of the "Planet Freedom" feature (last seen in Dragon Ball Z: Budokai 3). There are more combat combos and in-battle transformations, all topped of with a featured encyclopedia, which covers all the most important aspects of the Dragon Ball universe.  All the characters from the previous version are present, with some new ones (there are more in the Wii version), and up to ten characters can participate in a single battle, with a tag system. The locations include those of the previous game, with some additional ones.
