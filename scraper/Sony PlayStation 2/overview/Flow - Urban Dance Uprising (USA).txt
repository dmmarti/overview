 FLOW: Urban Dance Uprising is a dance game similar to Konami's Dance Dance Revolution series. Instead of being focused on J-Pop and other licensed tracks, the game is focused on hip-hop and urban culture. The game features fifty different songs from classic hip-hop artists such as The Sugarhill Gang and Kurtis Blow.  The point of the game is to clear several songs by pressing buttons on either a compatible dance pad or on your game pad. Your performance will affect your final score and any unlockable bonuses you get.  There are several unlockable features in the game, including more songs, characters, costumes and game locations. You obtain these as you progress in the game by completing the requirements given to you before you begin a stage. The game also supports the EyeToy accessory, so you can see yourself on the screen as you dance with the game.
