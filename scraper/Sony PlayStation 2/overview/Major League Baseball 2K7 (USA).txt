 This instalment in the 2K sports is based on the design of the past games with a bunch of new features and enhancements. The 2K7 edition has an all-new fielding and baseruninng A.I. system that simplifies the control allowing you to take control of each baserunner individually. New to this year too, is the pennant fever mode, in which you can take your favorite franchise all the way to the World Series Championship during the most intense part of the MLB season.  'The Farm' has been added to the Franchise mode, where aspiring owners can now scout and evaluate minor league players by playing full games with AAA clubs. Besides that, both the graphics engine as the MLB roster has been updated.  Also present is Inside Edge from last year's instalment, where player abilities are boosted through strength. 150 animations were added to mimic real-life stars based on signature style. The fielding has been redesigned, there is a dynamic throwing system and online play for the 360 and PS3 version. In a mini-game, the player can have the manager argue with the umpire by tapping a button.
