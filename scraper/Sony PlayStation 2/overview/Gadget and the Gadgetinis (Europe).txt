 The classically popular Inspector Gadget is back in his first all new incarnation in 17 years. This time he has been recruited by an elite international peacekeeping organization--which means new larger-than-life capers, new gadgets and a new set of assistants: the Gadgetinis--a group of tiny robotic versions of Inspector Gadget who are frequently the unintended victims of his bumbling. But in the end, thanks to his heart of gold, his indefatigable spirit and a little help from his brilliant niece Penny, Gadget always manages to save the day.
