 Described by a number of people as 'Gran Turismo meets SSX', Rumble Racing is an arcade-style racing game that includes features like various stunts, power-ups, speed boosts, and track short cuts.   There is no story behind it. You're merely racing in one of three dozen cars (many based on real-life designs) in fifteen different tracks, ranging from airports to old mines to specially designed stunt arenas. Taking part in either races, stunt shows, or in one-on-one duels, you'll need to learn not only how to drive, but also when to use power-ups and where the best short cuts are. Power-ups include oil slicks to bombs to a tornado that cleans the course ahead of you. Through the Championship mode, you'll be able to unlock all the vehicles and tracks.
