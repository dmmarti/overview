 The game features up to six modes : friendly, arcade, Pro Beach Soccer Tour, Tournament, Championship and Training modes. You will have the choice to play in Bangkok, Rio de Janeiro, Marseille or Venice Beach. You can also have the choice to listen to audio commentaries in English, Thai, French or Portuguese languages. At last, you can play up to two players at the same time, in solo or cooperative modes.  Since 2000, the Beach Soccer Wordwide organization (BSWW) has links with the FIFA Fair Play Campaign so we can see up to 32 official national teams, with some of their real stars such as Eric Cantonna or Pascal Olmeta for France, Ramiro Figueiras Amarelle or Valeiro Mato Roberto, both for Spain.
