 WRC : Rally Evolved is the 5th game of the WRC series on Playstation 2, since the  first one was released in 2001. It features all of the common game modes you can find in a rally game: Quick races, single rally or full championship. New features are Rally Cross: a race on a multi-lap track in solo or multi-player (4 players on the same screen or 16 through the internet). Another new mode is to challenge the multiple French world champion of WRC, Sebastien Loeb in a list of races where the player starts with a time handicap. A final mode gives the ability to free-run on a big complex on different kinds of road in the middle of a big oval track to test more than 40 rally cars, coming from past, present and future (included in the game). This version of the game has improved graphics compared to the previous version, WRC 4. Navigator voice acting is much more precise and game-play has a new feature: environmental hazards that affect the race: fire, rocks, animals or other competitors to avoid.
