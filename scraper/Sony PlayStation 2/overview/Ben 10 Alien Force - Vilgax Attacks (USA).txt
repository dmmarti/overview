 Players take on the role of Ben Tennyson from the television series Ben 10: Alien Force. Vilgax is once again attempting to invade earth, and Ben is the only hero who can stand in his way of Vilgax's newly discovered Null Void cannon.   Players are able to transform into eight alien forms to battle their way through Vilgax's minions and solve various puzzles along the way. The action takes place on the home worlds of Ben's alien forms as players platform their way through the lava pits of Vulpin and break their way through the temples of Terradino. Combat uses a combo based attack system focused on grand special attacks which take out several enemies at a time. Enemies spawn in waves of several enemies each, creating swarms of enemy attackers.  Along with Vilgax, several other memorable villains from the series make appearance throughout the game in epic boss battles.
