 Capcom’s Fighting Evolution is the ultimate classic head-to-head brawler to date!  And by classic we mean Classic!  Fighting Evolution includes characters from not only Street Fighter II, Street Fighter III, and Street Fighter Alpha, but also from bone crushing favorites Darkstalkers and Red Earth.  Even as you’re at your last wits unlocking the hidden characters, each familiar face will bring a smile to any gamer.  Each and every character maintains their original fighting styles, so strategy is king in this rumble.  Picking the right character is your key to victory.  This comes into play especially in the two-on-two team battles, as well as the wide variety of other gameplay modes available, and all of it in classic 6 button control scheme!
