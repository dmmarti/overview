 In this officially licensed AND 1 Street basketball game, players can take it to the streets with playground legends like The Professor, Main Event, Hot Sauce, and Half Man Half Amazing in 5-on-5 down to 1-on-1 matchups. Ballers can play on over a dozen courts all across the world, from Venice Beach on the West Coast, to Rucker Park in the East, and even "Down Under" in Australia. Players can also use the Create-a-Baller feature to build their own Streetball persona and enter the story-driven AND 1 Mix Tape Tour to secure a contract with AND 1 and earn a place among legends.  The game features motion-captured trick moves, spectacular dunks, and full voiceovers and likenesses of the entire AND 1 team. Multiplayer games are supported on both PS2 and Xbox. If you have the EyeToy camera, you can also put your face in the game (PS2 only).
