 This is an improved port of the PSP game Tokobot. It's the same game as the PSP title, but includes many extras. There are 10 new stages that include a Treasure Hunting mini-game that will unlock new Tokobot and Bolt upgrades. More characters have been added to the story, including an instructor and a new rival. Six new boss enemies can be found throughout the game. Lastly, there's a time attack mode that can be unlocked, and while playing in this mode, you'll find many treasures not found anywhere else.
