 Romance of the Three Kingdoms VIII is the eighth installment in the Romance of the Three Kingdoms turn-based strategy game series. Once again, it is based on the events taken from the classic Chinese novel "San Guo" ("Three Kingdoms"). The story takes place in 3rd century A.D., when the Han Dynasty was powerless to stop a civil war in China, and when warriors from different provinces of China tried to defeat each other and to gain the power to rule over the whole country.  Romance of the Three Kingdoms VIII offers some innovations and enhancements. The player can now control all eight main characters during the same game. Of the 711 officer characters, the player can create 100. Each of those officers has unique skills wich can be employed in combat or help to create a powerful army. The player can also freely choose a starting date for the game events, ranging between 184 A.D. (Yellow Turban Rebellion) and 234 A.D. (death of Zhuge Liang, one of the most important characters of the novel).
