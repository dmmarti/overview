 Hot Shots Golf Fore! (HSG4) continues the cute-golf style of Hot Shots Golf 3 with a new major addition - online play. You can take your golf game online and challenge other golfers in stroke play or match play games to see who the best video golfer in the world is.  You can play through tournaments on one of 12 different golf courses, each with varied layouts, weather, and hazards. There is also a par-3 short course, and two mini-golf courses where your goal is to score points by sinking long putts within two strokes.  There are many things to unlock in HSG4. You can add new golfers to your roster by challenging and defeating them in Vs. Mode. You can also purchase new costumes, caddies, clubs, and balls at the golf shop by earning points during tournaments and Vs. play. As you perform well in these game, your ranking will improve (from Rookie to Amateur to Pro), and so too will the strength of the opposition.
