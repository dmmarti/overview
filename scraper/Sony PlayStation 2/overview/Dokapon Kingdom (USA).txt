 In Dokapon Kingdom monsters have attacked and pillaged the kingdom of its riches. For the adventurer who returns the kingdom's wealth, his majesty offers the honor of his daughter's hand, and therefore the title of future king. This doesn't mean, however, that you aren't permitted to play as a female character. You simply receive an altered ending in this instance.  Three different modes are available: Story Mode, Normal Mode, and Shopping Race. You then create your character and begin play, the mode you choose having an affect on the overall goal to be achieved. The Story Mode is the standard play through of the plot, Normal Mode lets you generate certain factors of play ahead of time, like starting level, and go from there, etc. There are 3 started classes (warrior, chief and magician) and through levelling eventually 11 become available.  While having a board game scenario with a spinner that allows the player to move over a game board, this is very much a light role-playing game as it has basic jobs, a battle system, and upgrades. Landing on a spot can trigger a battle, advance the story or introduce a mini-game. It is a 2-player game at all times (with another character controlled by the computer), but up to 4 people can participate.
