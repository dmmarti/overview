 NBA 2K9 is the latest update in the long running 2K series with the obligatory roster update with the latest NBA stars.  The same game modes are still present: Exhibition, Season and Franchise with the same type of gameplay with some tweaks.  One of the newest tweaks is the ability for the player to change their shot's trajectory in mid-air and an advanced AI that reacts to the players performance.  Players can also track their players performance, morale and attitude during franchise mode to keep their players happy and content with their place on the team.  There are also new cutscenes for the highlight reels and features online capabilities where players can compete in online leagues or face against another team head-to-head.    Players can also upload their created players along with custom made highlight reels that they can share on their respective online provider (the PS2 version does not feature this mode).  Clark Kellogg, Cheryl Miller and Kevin Harlan provide their voice talents to the game.
