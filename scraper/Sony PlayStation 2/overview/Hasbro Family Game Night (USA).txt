 Hasbro Family Game Night is a mini-game collection of conversions of Hasbro board games. It contains the classic versions as well as advanced or remixed variants. The game is hosted by Hasbro's toy figure Mr. Potato Head.  The includes games are:  1. Battleship 2. Boggle 3. Connect 4 4. Scrabble (North American versions only, PS3 (PSN) and Xbox 360 retail + XBLA) 5. Sorry! 6. Sorry! Sliders 7. Yahtzee  There is no retail PS3 release. On the Xbox 360 it was also released on XBLA next to a retail version. There it was made available as a free application where users can buy the individual games to be played through the Hasbro Family Game Night hub, similar to Game Room. Not all games were released simultaneously on XBLA and three additional titles are available for that platform:  1. Connect 4x4 8. Jenga 9. Pictureka  Those three games are also available for the Wii, but as a part of the retail game Family Game Night 2.  The Wii version includes a Party mode (only for human players) with a mixed-up mish-mash of each of the six games and rules similar to the Mario Party series. Most games can be played with up to four players, except for the PlayStation 2 version where only two players can compete.
