 Need For Speed: ProStreet is the 11th game in the NFS series.   It doesn't just include new and more detailed graphics, it includes a new type of gameplay. The game doesn't have a Free Roam mode (as in Underground 2, Most Wanted or Carbon), but it has an Event Map, similar to Juiced's Event Calendar.  The player's main goal in this game is to become the "King of the street". Nothing new. However, there are no more illegal races in the game - all of the available races are sponsored, and the action takes place on different racing tracks. No more traffic, no more in-town driving.  The game features 2 gameplay modes. Career (you start your "life" as a lowlife race driver and over time you will conquer everyone) and free play (where you can race unlocked cars and unlocked tracks).  As usual, the game includes a jukebox where you can listen to some singles, used by EA as the game's Sound Track. The game also includes new car models, and the classic racing modes except for cop chases, since ProStreet does not promote illegal racing. Also as usual, when you first start the game you will be prompted to create an alias (profile). You can choose which one will be loaded when you start the game again. After creating the alias, you are prompted to choose your difficulty settings.  All versions, except for the PlayStation 2 and Wii, contain online multiplayer modes.
