 In the year 2044, Richard Osmond and Claudia Seifer take a flight into space in order to be married on Earth's Moon. However during the flight there is an accident and Richard wakes up disoriented and alone. Something strange seems to be going on, and maybe Richard is even seeing ghosts! He has to find Claudia before it's too late, and figure out what's going on.  Echo Night: Beyond is a 1st person adventure game. Controlling Richard, the player moves around picking up and interacting with objects, including security cameras and computer logs. He remains in his space suit which provides a flashlight as well as a heart monitor. As he explores his surroundings on the moon, he's bound to become fearful and a little creeped out. If Richard's heart rate ever goes above 300, he'll die and the game is over.
