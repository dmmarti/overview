 You play gold old boys Bo and Luke Duke as you fight to rescue Uncle Jesse from jail and save Hazzard County from Boss Hogg's latest rotten scheme.  As Bo and Luke you'll tour Hazzard County by car on back roads, race circuits, and country routes in a series of timed missions which range from racing to chasing to gathering parts to build their famous car, the General Lee.  Hazzard County's famous landmarks are all here, from the Duke Farm to Cooter's Garage to the Boar's Nest and all points between.  The slip-sliding, rally-style, third person action takes place exclusively behind the wheel.  Controls include steering, braking, rear view, etc.  Dixie Horn and "Yee-HAW!" buttons included.  Based on the original television series.  Surviving original cast members provide the voices.
