 Gallop Racer 2001 is the first in the series to make it's appearance on the PlayStation 2 console.  The player can partake in a simulation where, as an owner of a stable, they can buy, sell, retire and breed various race horses throughout their career while training and conditioning them along the way.  The player will start out with a small amount of Jockey Points that act as currency in this game, using this to start out their stable by buying a horse and entering them in races.  Depending how well their horses and jockeys perform during races, they can continue to expand their empire and become the best in the business.  Not only can the player act as an owner, on race day they can also become the jockey and use their horses strengths to win races in a variety of tracks.  The player must play to their horse's strengths and avoid exposing their weaknesses through various weather conditions.  If the player and horse does well enough, the horse's attributes can change after the match, but also be affected negatively if they do poorly.  There is also a Practice mode where the player can learn how to play the game through the various modes and even have the ability to bet on horse races, however this can only be done on this mode.  Players can also go head-to-head in a split-screen, either with default horses or ones from their season mode.
