 You are Henry Townshend, a man living in a small apartment in South Ashfield, a neighboring town of the infamous Silent Hill.  On one strange night, Henry has a terrible nightmare, with recurring events; his phone is dead, his windows are sealed, and his neighbors can't hear him.  He looks at his door, only to see it is blocked by several, thick metal chains.  A note is pinned to the door: andquot;Don't go out!andquot;  It is signed only by a man named Walter.  Henry explores his apartment, trying to figure out what is happening, when he spots a giant hole in the wall of his bathroom.  Henry goes through the hole, only to find a portal which leads him to alternate dimensions.  Hopefully, Henry will find out the truth about his apartment, Room 302, and live.  Silent Hill 4: The Room is similar to past games in terms of atmosphere.  The game is dark and foreboding, never letting you know what's behind the next corner or down the street.  SH4 takes the series in a new direction, with multiple new features.  First and foremost is never actually leaving your apartment.  You utilize a strange portal to travel to alternate dimensions, including a hospital, a cult command center deep in the forest, and a prison.  Aside from the traditional third-person-view, there is now a first-person mode, which is used to control Henry when he is in his apartment.  The game has a feature that, whenever you look at something of importance, an eyeball will appear to tell you that you can interact with it.  The previous games have mostly been about exploring the town and solving puzzles, but Silent Hill 4 has much more combat involved.  There are more enemies in a given area, and more narrow areas and cramped spaces.  To help you in combat, you've got the standard arsenal of Silent Hill games, such as the steel pipe, pistol, and new to this game, a golf club.
