 You play as Lieutenant Jonathan Farrel, an American G.I. previously stationed in Europe but assigned as single member of the special-ops group called "Eagle Rage", fighting in the Pacific during World War II against Japanese soldiers. You will have to carry 12 missions, mostly in jungle environment and with a certain degree of freedom like choosing an alternate road or hiding behind a rock. But be careful when you're reloading your weapon, a blur effect is triggered and affects your view.  The PS2 and Wii versions are different from the 360/PS3/PC. Indeed, you're playing a Lieutenant with a background story, doing his job alone and narrating himself his time during WWII and not a simple soldier, accompanied by his comrades, following his sergeant's orders.  Being a History Channel product, this FPS is based on real weaponry or places. Each level begins with a documentary composed of authentic footage.
