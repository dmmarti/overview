 Mercenaries: Playground of Destruction is a "sandbox" war action game with open-ended gameplay in a gigantic world. Set against the outbreak of warfare spurred on a Korean dictator coup, players are sent in as one of three mercenaries to capture the "Deck of 52".  Each card in the deck represents a high-priority target that you can take down for cash.  Your primary target: General Song a.k.a. the Ace of Spades.    Players have free reign of a massive landscape to take bounties on the "Deck of 52", as well as a number of factions.  Four factions have moved in to take advantage of the coup for personal gains.  Each faction will offer the player resources such as vehicles and supplies, as well as missions that the player can use to make money off of.  If the player makes a faction happy, they will offer intel on the locations of various bounties from the deck.   You have a vast array of resources available to you to get the job done.  Commandeer tanks, choppers and and any other military hardware to blow up the game's miles of destructible landscape across the North Korean countryside.  Help out various factions to gain access to numerous vehicle drops, supply drops, and air strikes.  Capture enough of the Deck of 52 to gain enough intel and money to go after the big boys themselves: the Aces.
