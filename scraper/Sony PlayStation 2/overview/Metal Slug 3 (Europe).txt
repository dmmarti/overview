 In the third installment of the Metal Slug series, General Morden is back and he plans to establish a new world order. You guide one of the heroes: Marco, Tarma, Eri or Fio as they blast their way through sidescrolling levels with a unique theme, filled with countless enemies and difficult bosses. You have to free hostages and you can ride bizarre vehicles such as camels, elephants, tanks and robots.  In the Xbox version, additional game modes, such as Storming the Mothership and Chubby Isle Paradiso, can be unlocked upon completing the five arcade stages. A co-op mode has been included, but no online multiplayer. The only Xbox Live feature available allows you to compare singleplayer scores.
