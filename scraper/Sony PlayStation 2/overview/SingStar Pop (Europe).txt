 SingStar Pop is a karaoke game, released exclusively in North America and featuring hit pop songs.  The game gives points which are distributed by the purity of singing, as in how well does one manage to stay on tune. It doesn't matter if you change octaves in the middle of the song or what words are you singing in (it doesn't have a word recognition), so your singing is rated by how well you manage to hit the correct note at the correct time.  Here is the tracklist: •3 Doors Down - "Kryptonite" •a-Ha - "Take On Me" •Alicia Keys - "Fallin" •All-American Rejects - "Move Along" •Ashlee Simpson - "Invisible" •Avril Lavigne - "Sk8er Boi" •Blue October - "Hate Me" •Britney Spears - "Baby One More Time" •Cartel - "Honestly" •Cyndi Lauper - "Girls Just Wanna Have Fun" •Daniel Powter - "Bad Day" •Destiny's Child - "Survivor" •Franz Ferdinand - "Take Me Out" •Gorillaz - "Feel Good, Inc." •Hinder - "Lips Of An Angel" •Hoobastank - "The Reason" •James Blunt - "You're Beautiful" •Jesse McCartney - "Beautiful Soul" •Lifehouse - "Hanging By A Moment" •My Chemical Romance - "Helena" •Natasha Bedingfield - "These Words" •Panic!
