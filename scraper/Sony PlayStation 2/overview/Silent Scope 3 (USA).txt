 Silent Scope returns to the PS2 for a third round. This time, your out to stop a terrorist organization from using cloning technology to destroy the world. You must snipe your way through countless enemies and end of level boss characters until the threat is no more.  Two game types are included here. The first is a total conversion of the arcade game, titled Silent Scope EX. The second, and the main event here, is an exclusive version for the PS2 which includes new levels, characters and more.
