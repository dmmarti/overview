 Yourself!Fitness is a fitness game that includes over 500 types of exercises led by a virtual personal fitness coach named Maya. There are five areas in which you can focus your exercise: Weight Loss, Cardio, Upper Strength, Core Strength, and Lower Strength. Also, you can do Yoga and many healthy recipes are included in the program. The game starts with a fitness assessment where the intensity of the training is determined by comparing the player's resting heart rate with the heart rate after performing a set of jumping jacks. External elements such as an exercise ball, hand weights, an exercise step, or a heart rate monitor can be incorporated in the program.
