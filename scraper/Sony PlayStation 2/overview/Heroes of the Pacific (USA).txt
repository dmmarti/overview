 Heroes of the Pacific is an arcade flying game set in the Pacific theatre of World War II. Heroes has six game modes including Campaign Mode, Mission Mode, Instant Action, Training, Historical Missions and Multiplayer.  In the Campaign mode, the player is William Crowe, a young pilot who survives the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor, but loses his brother. Crowe vows to avenge his bother's death, pursuing the squadron responsible though the major battles in the Pacific. The game follows the player's quest from Pearl Harbor, to Wake Island, Marshall Islands, Coral Sea, Midway, Guadalcanal, Gilbert Islands, Marianas, Philippines, and finally Iwo Jima.  As players progress through the campaigns, they earn new planes, including fighters, dive-bombers, torpedo-bombers, and medium bombers. Early in the game the player only has the most basic fighters; like the Warhawk and Wildcat. As they complete missions and progress through the campaign, they are awarded new planes.  The game features over thirty famous planes including: F6F Hellcat, P-38 Lightning, TBF Avenger, F4U Corsair, B25 Mitchell, P-51 Mustang, Seafire, A6M Zero andquot;Zekeandquot;, J2M Raiden andquot;Jackandquot;, Ki-84 Hayate andquot;Frankandquot;, ME262 and FW190.  The war in the Pacific and William Crowe's personal quest for revenge both come together in the final assault on Iwo Jima, the volcanic fortress-island under Japanese control.
