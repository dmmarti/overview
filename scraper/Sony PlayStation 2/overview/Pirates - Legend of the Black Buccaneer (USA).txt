 Pirate Francis Blade suffers shipwreck and washes ashore on the mysterious island La Borgne. In a cave, he discovers an amulet that allows him to transform into Black Buccaneer, a cursed pirate with supernatural voodoo powers. He needs to find a way off the island, collect items to repair his ship, and fight the witch La Borgne who guards the treasure she has collected over the years.  The 3rd-person gameplay is similar to the modern Prince of Persia games. Francis Blade uses his sword, gun, and magic to fight enemies in a Caribbean setting. There are also a lot of environment-based puzzles with acrobatic moves. The area has been divided into 18 major sections, not all of them available right away. Blade needs to collect new powers for his Black Buccaneer form, and can for instance take control of enemies or summon minions.  Killing enemies provides points, which can be used to offer to the voodoo god to continue when Blade dies.
