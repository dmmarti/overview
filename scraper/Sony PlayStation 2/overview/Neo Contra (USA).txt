 Neo Contra is the sequel to Contra: Shattered Soldier. The game is a 3-D Shooter with lots of action and huge boss battles. Unlike Shattered Soldiers this game has a top-down perspective. The game is set in the future with Bill Razer's return. He teams up with a samurai, Genbei Jaguer Yagyu. The game takes about two hours to beat but will take you several tries to make it there.
