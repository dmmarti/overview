 An updated remake of Baroque, a post-apocalyptic RPG game in which all hell has literally broke loose on earth. As the game starts, the world has been devastated by a heat wave and left nothing but demon infested ruins and a mysterious "Nerve Tower" which many claim that holds the answers to the apocalypse. You play as an amnesiac survivor who decides to enter the tower in search for clues to both your identity and the reasons behind the apocalypse.  The game plays as an RPG dungeon-crawler, in which you control your character and attempt to clear each floor in the tower from monsters, earning experience and items and only occasionally journeying outside the tower to get weapons and equipment from a few NPCs.  The PS2 remake adds additional floors, items and creatures and updates the whole game with a completely polygonal engine (the original used 2D sprites to depict characters and monsters). Furthermore, the point of view has been changed from first person to third person and the gameplay has been modified accordingly to make the game more of an action-RPG than the original.
