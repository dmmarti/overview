 Set five hundred years before the time of the original PC hit, EverQuest, you and thousands of other players create your own story and history through battles, exploration and cave hunting.  Five continents, Odus, Tunaria (the past before Antonica, as the Elves are just beginning to leave the world), Faydwer, Kunark, and Velious, the moon Luclin, and alternate planes of existence are available to explore, although some can only be reached after you achieve a certain level of experience.  Non playable characters (NPCs) will give you main quests to complete, depending on your specific class, or you can compelte your own quests with others or against.
