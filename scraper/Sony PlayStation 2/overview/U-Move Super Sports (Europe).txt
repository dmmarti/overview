 A Konami-developed game for the EyeToy USB Camera. U-Move Super Sports features dozens of mini-games, with sports such as Rugby and Soccer being the main basis for levels.   The game is loosely based on the original EyeToy game EyeToy: Play. Many of the games are very similar and it plays much the same. Most levels have a jungle setting with fitting music. Every level is different from the last, and tests different skills, such as how quick you can react to a signal or how accurate a batter you are.
