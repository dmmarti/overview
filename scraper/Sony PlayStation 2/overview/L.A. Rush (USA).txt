 You are Trikz, a well-known street racer who lives the good life: A fat crib, lots of money, and an impressive collection of pimped-out rides. However, your arch-enemy Lidel, fuming with envy, uses his connections to take all that away from you. Your cash? Your place? Your beloved cars? All gone.  You are now set on getting it all back from Lidel, and, while you're at it, stealing his girl's heart too. You begin your mission at the bottom with some punk-ass car, winning back money and cars race by race. There are many kinds of races, like Endurance Races, Stunt Races, Cross-town Races, and many more.  As the name suggests, the game is set on the streets of Los Angeles, which is filled with traffic and cops that stand in your way to fame and fortune. Being set in the street racer scene, the game also offers lots of possibilities to pimp out our cars (through a tie-in with West Coast Custom), and the game's soundtrack is full with (edited, T-rated) hip-hop.
