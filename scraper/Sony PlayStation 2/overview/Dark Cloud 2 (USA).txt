 As a young inventor, you are called upon to search the dangerous dungeons, battle evil monsters and re-claim towns and cities.  By fighting your way through the various dungeons, you must find various ores hidden away. With these ores, you can determine which parts you need to re-build a town. It is up to you to find or create the parts needed to build the various buildings of each town, as well various other parts to each town.  During your adventure, you can also take pictures of various items. Once you have a certain amount, you can then come up with ideas for an invention that will aid you in your quest. From there, you must again find the parts needed to create the invention, and then use the invention either to help you defeat enemies or build the towns.
