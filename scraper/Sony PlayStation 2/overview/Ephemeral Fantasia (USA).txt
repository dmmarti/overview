 In this game, you control Mouse (that's his name!), a silent musician, who travels with his talking guitar Pattimo. One day Mouse is invited to play at a royal wedding on an island called Pandule. But soon you discover that the groom Xelpherpolis (the name sounds like a Greek town!) has put an awful time-looping spell on the island, and intends to destroy this way the entire population. You have to stop the villain! Most important, you have to recruit other people to your small army.  "Ephemeral Fantasia" combines diverse features from earlier games for different platforms: the time-looping is a reminiscent of "Zelda: Ocarina of Time" for Nintendo 64; the game possesses an internal clock (hours and days), like in Quest for Glory series for PC or in "Shenmue" for Dreamcast; its role-playing system, turn-based combat and character design are clearly inspired by Final Fantasy games.
