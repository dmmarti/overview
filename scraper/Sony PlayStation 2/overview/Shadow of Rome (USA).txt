 Shadow of Rome sends gamers back to 44 B.C. Ancient Rome - a stunning yet brutal time when the republic had grown to be the dominating cultural force in the world.  However, the Senate's rule began to cast a dark shadow of Rome's former glory as corruption and war bred despair lead to the rise of Julius Caesar who exuded a confidence that would rally the people and lead them from turmoil.  Then on the Ides of March Caesar was brutally assassinated in an act that changed the face of the western world forever.  Join Agrippa the Centurion and Octavianus, the stealthy brain, in an action/adventure that goes deep into this conspiracy and to the heart of danger in an attempt to clear Vipsanius, Agrippa's father from the wrongful accusation of Caesar's murder.
