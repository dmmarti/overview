 G-Force is a licensed game based on the movie of the same name. The player takes the control of Darwin who is member of a secret government organization consisting of guinea pigs. His mission: defending the evil industrial magnate Saber who manipulates home appliances and uses them as weapons. Not surprisingly these are the main foes in this game. But Darwin is not even close to helpless: various guns and gadgets, e.g. a jet pack, a electronic whip or a grappling hook, are used to dispatch of them. Most of the time is spent in fights but there are also puzzles. Many of them require the usage of Mooch, a fly. It can be summoned at any time and is able to reach high grounds, to deactivate electronic devices, to fly through small holes and even to slow down time to pass through fast moving obstacles.  During the course of the game the player can find computer chips and hidden disks. On one hand these can be used to refresh ammo and health or to upgrade weapons. There is also the option to switch to a infrared view and scan objects. This rewards additional information.  The PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360 versions have an optional playing mode for 3D glasses.
