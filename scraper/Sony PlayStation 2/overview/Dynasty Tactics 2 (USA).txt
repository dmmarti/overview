 The sequel to Dynasty Tactics gives the player more tactics to choose from.  In this game, the player is one of the four important leaders in ancient China. The player moves armies over the map, engage other armies, and needs to conquer the other kingdoms. The battle system is a bit like chess: the player moves the officers around the battlefield and uses special tactics and combos to kill enemies.
