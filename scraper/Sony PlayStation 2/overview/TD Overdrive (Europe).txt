 Test Drive Overdrive possesses a unique feel and personality due to its story mode. The player is immersed into a world of underground and illegal street racing, pitting their racing prowess against other street racers while at the same time trying to remain one step ahead of the pursuing police as they push their courage and ability to the limit, along with the limits of their car.  Featuring over 20 licensed exotic sports cars and all-American muscle cars including the Jaguar XK-R and the Nissan Skyline, the Ford Mustang and the Plymouth Cuda. Exact digital and aural recreations of their real-world counterparts, all of the cars in TD Overdrive also contain ultra-realistic behavioural physics. The game also features four real-world locations including London and San Francisco in which traffic will react as it does in reality with vehicles stopping at traffic lights and crossing at intersections; pedestrians will jump out of the way to avoid being hit and roadside objects can be collided with and destroyed.
