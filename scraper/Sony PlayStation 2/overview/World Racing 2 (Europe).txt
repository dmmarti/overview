 Compared to its predecessor World Racing, where you could only drive different Mercedes Benz cars, you now can control over 90 different cars from 17 different manufacturers like Alfa Romeo or Morgan.  The core of the game is the career-mode with 120 races which take you all around the globe. From Italy to Florida where you earn your 'Speedbucks' to buy new cars and tuning options.  To make it more difficult for you, the game also features oncoming traffic and a detailed damage model including realistic driving physics. You can also customize your car with vinyls, alloy rims and many other extras.
