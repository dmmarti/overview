 Treasures of Aht Urhgan is the third expansion for the original Final Fantasy XI Online game. It introduces a new continent on Vana'diel: Aridjiah (known as the Near East), with the Aht Urhgan race. Just like the previous expansions, there are new jobs available: Blue Mage, Corsair and Puppetmaster. New monsters have been included as well. This expansion, along with the first two, is included with the Xbox 360 release of the game.
