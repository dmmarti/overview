 Buzz!:  Brain of Oz is the next game in the Buzz! quiz series for the Playstation 2.  Like the other games in the series it is played with the Buzz! controllers which will allow up to 8 players to pit the skills against each other if 2 sets of the controllers are used. It is part of the global Buzz!: Brain of the World brand with 21 different versions for specific countries, such as Buzz!: Brain of the UK for the UK.  Once again the game is based on a quiz show with the contestants having to answer a variety of questions specific to Australia from movies to sport, general knowledge and much more.  Boasting over 4,000 questions and 'hilarious' new rounds, the EyeToy can also be used to see yourself on screen as you play.
