 State of Emergency 2, the sequel to the first game, paints a bleak vision of a future in which individual freedoms have been eliminated by the brutal regime known only as the "Corporation". In the face of these overwhelming odds, a small group of citizens have dedicated themselves to overthrowing the Corporation, forming a resistance group called "Freedom".  Freedom's fight against the Corporation forms the basis of a single-player campaign that allows the player to take control of each of the resistance group's members, including leader Spanky MacNeil. Each character has a range of special abilities that help them to take on the Corporation forces.  Viewing the action from a third-person perspective, the player can take on the enemy with a wide variety of weapons, including rifles, grenades and the all-powerful rocket launcher. Using vehicles found along the way, Freedom's operatives can cause major Corporation carnage.  A variety of challenge modes expand on the single-player game, giving players the opportunity to unlock hidden characters and other extras. There's also a range of split-screen multiplayer modes, including Deathmatch, Capture the Flag and Last Man Standing. Up to four would-be freedom fighters can join the action.
