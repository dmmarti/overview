 This year's edition allows you to compete against legendary players including Gordie Howe, Bobby Hull, Phil Esposito, and Marcel Dionne.  New Jersey Devils announcers Mike Emrick and Darren Pang call the games.  There is an exhibition mode for up to eight players with the Multitap, a season mode for multiple players, playoff mode, tournament mode, a practice option, and shoot-out mode, that helps to sharpen your breakaway and deke moves.  Also new this year are the updated rosters of all NHL teams including expansion teams Columbus BlueJackets and Minnesota Wild.
