 Take to the lanes with this exciting bowling game featuring a large and diverse cast of crazy personalities.  Whether you choose the brooding Ivan the Giant, the innocent-looking school girl Pearl, the sweet grandma Edna, or the too-cool Miles, you're sure to be up for a bowling challenge in the six diverse locations.  There are three different modes of play for single player mode: Challenge, which has you facing off against an amateur bowler, then a professional.  Beat the pro and you unlock that player!  Match Play takes you through a long ladder tournament, while Shootout pits you against two other opponents in each round.  In addition to this, you can play multiplayer with up to three of your friends.
