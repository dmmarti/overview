 Cars: Race-O-Rama is a racing game set in the Disney/Pixar Cars universe.  It is the third entry in a series of THQ licensed games that include Cars and Cars: Mater-National Championship .  The game includes a single-player story mode and an arcade mode.  In story mode, you progress through a series of races and mini-games with a series of cutscenes.  In arcade mode, you can replay story mode events and compete in 2-player split-screen races.  The plot of Cars: Race-O-Rama centers around Lightning McQueen as he trains students of the Doc Hudson Racing Academy to compete in the Race-O-Rama Circuit.  Soon, Lightning discovers that his arch-enemy, Chick Hicks, is training a rival group of racers who don't race by the rules.  Lightning must compete against these rival racers in an effort to win the Race-O-Rama trophy.  Story mode uses an open-world format, where you can explore the world and play different events by driving to marked waypoints.  There are 7 different main explorable areas including Radiator Springs Stadium, Ornament Valley, Tailfin Pass, Radiator Springs, Santa Carburera, Autovia, and Motoropolis.  There are also 3 mini-games based on the Disney/Pixar animated short series "Cars Toons" that center around the character Mater.  These include "Mater the Greater", "El Materdor", and "Tokyo Mater".  While racing, there is a boost meter that slowly fills over time.  Using the boost will give you a quick speed increase.  There is also a new drifting mechanic that allows you to take tighter turns and fill the boost meter more rapidly.  You can also jump in most races to avoid obstacles and other racers.
