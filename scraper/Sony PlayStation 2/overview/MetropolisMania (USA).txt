 Metropolismania is a city building game with a Japanese anime style.  The goal is to grow a town to a target population. This is accomplished by interacting with NPCs and becoming friends by giving them gifts and talking with them. Attract citizens by building up the town with offices, grocers, entertainment and farming buildings (to name a few).  Rather than overlooking the environment, the player controls a character from a thirdperson perspective. Walking around, new constructions can be started and roads can be built. The buildings can be entered too. Side quests happen every level, some of which are quite strange. Expect to be involved in a smuggling ring or a cult.
