 One of EAs best selling franchises sees another yearly update, just months after the release of UEFA Euro 2008. However, continuing with the improvements seen in previous games, the developers tweaked the game further, such as adding a new physics model, which brings more realism to collisions, but also increased responsiveness and goalkeeper AI and animations.  Featuring thirty leagues and passing the half-thousand team mark, the game includes the usual modes seen in previous games, with enhancements to the Be a Pro mode, as well as a  10 vs 10 online mode. There's also a new paid premium mode, named Adidas Live Season, which tracked the real results of  six of the biggest leagues, and changed player statistics according to their actual form.
