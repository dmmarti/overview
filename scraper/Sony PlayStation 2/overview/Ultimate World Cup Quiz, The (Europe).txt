 The Ultimate World Cup Quiz is a football trivia game for up to four players. It's identical to The Great British Football Quiz except it only includes questions about the FIFA World Cup. It spans all the way back to the original 1930 World Cup in Uruguay. It contains four different game modes:•Top of the League •Play or Pass •Shootout •Football Crazy For each question the player gets four alternatives to choose from. Top of the League consists of three rounds of eight questions and the player with most points at the end of round three wins. With use of jokers the player can remove two wrong alternatives. Play or Pass also consists of three rounds of eight questions and players play together. Jokers are not available in this mode. In Shootout jokers are used to force the other player to answer. Football Crazy is played over three rounds consisting of one round of each of the other game modes. All modes can be played by up to four players but only the Top of the League mode can be played by one player.
