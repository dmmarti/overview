 Air Ranger Rescue is a single player game in which the player pilots a rescue helicopter.  There are three helicopters to fly in this game, the MBB/Kawasaki BK-117-B, the Boeing CH-47J "Chinook ", and the Hughes/Kawasaki OH-6D. The game consists of eight timed missions each of which has three levels of difficulty, plus in the training section there's also a 'Free Flight' mode. The first missions are flown in the small OH-6D, missions two and above together with the other craft being locked off until the preceding missions have been completed successfully. Missions are scored on a points system, victims must be rescued while in good health so points are lost if they are not picked up in good time and, of course, points are deducted should the helicopter hit a building or should a victim die.  The training section is in the form of a manual and it not only explains the game's controls but also the workings of the helicopter and includes sections of video footage.
