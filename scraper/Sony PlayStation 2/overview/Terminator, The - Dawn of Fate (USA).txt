 The Tech Com forces trying to defend earth from the destructive Skynet machines for many years. Terminator T-800 has a new deadly plan - travel back to 1984 to kill Sarah Connor, and thus prevent her son, the resistance leader John Connor, being born. If you can get to a time travel device, you can stop this. The stakes could not be higher - without John, your force would be nothing.  The game is a third-person action game, with 11 levels across a range of terrains. You can play as Kyle Reese, Catherine Luna and another secret character - each of whom has their own moves, and can use 20 different weapons ranging from rocket launchers to explosives. The camera view can be used to target an enemy.
