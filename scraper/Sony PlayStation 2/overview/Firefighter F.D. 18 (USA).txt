 Firefighter F.D. 18 is your basic action/adventure game with a twist. Instead on monsters, the game's main protagonist Dean McGregor has to take on some nasty fires instead. Most of the time the player is putting out fires, saving innocent people and completing other tasks. Once in a while, there is also a "Boss Fire" who has to be defeated before one can proceed to the next level. This is not a fireman simulation by any means, but an arcade-like experience with lots of flames, and a storyline, which revolves around an arsonist and is as deep and multi layered as your typical action movie. The main thing about Firefighter F.D. 18 however, is the action, and there's plenty of it.
