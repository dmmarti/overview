 Frank Herbert's Dune is a 3D action game based on the TV mini-series. As Paul, the son of the Duke Atreides's concubine and heir to the throne, you must earn the trust and respect from the natives of the planet Dune, the Fremen, to ultimately become their propehsied Messiah, Muad'Dib. You will have to free them from the desolate conditions their home planet is in. Done that, there still is the evil Lord Harkonnen, who, with covert backup from the Emperor, slaughtered your family... do you really let him get away with this?  The game's music score is from the original TV series score.
