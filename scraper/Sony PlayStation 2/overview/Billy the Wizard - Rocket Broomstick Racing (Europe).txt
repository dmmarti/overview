 Billy the Wizard: Rocket Broomstick Racing involves Billy the Wizard having to race alongside other wizards in the broomstick Grand Prix. Opponents can be blasted out of the sky with magical powers. Players need to collect extra ammunition or power-ups while flying through the environment, dodging obstacles. There are three main sequences in the game: the racing, collecting spell books that have been escaped from the library and dragon chases where Billy and his friends hunt down a dragon to defeat it, while dealing with the minions.  There are 40 stages spread across five levels and the game also includes eight playable characters to choose from. There are six game modes in total, such as Orb Domination, two Grand Prix and Hoop Chase. Multiplayer is available for up to four players simultaneously.
