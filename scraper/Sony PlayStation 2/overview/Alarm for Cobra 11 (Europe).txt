 Alarm f√ºr Cobra 11 is a licensed game about the eponymous German action TV series. It is the first game released in the series. As expected the player controls a car, chases bad people down and causes a lot of explosions. The game is divided into 15 missions with goals like stopping a ghost driver or protect another car. After every mission the player unlocks a video clip from the show and sometimes he get a better car. In a second playing mode the player executes stunts like jumping over parked cars or smashing as much cars as possible.
