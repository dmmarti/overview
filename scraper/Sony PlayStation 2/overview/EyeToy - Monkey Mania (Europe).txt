 EyeToy: Monkey Mania is an ideal game for kids and their families. With board game style play you can spin the roulette wheel and move around the course of Bubble Island encountering penalty squares, traps, bonuses and all manner of unexpected obstacles. The game is full of cheeky monkeys who you must befriend and use as currency, but it's not always easy as you'll never know when they'll strike with their mischievous ways! Some of these squares will lead you to one of 50 fantastic and fun mini games.  By using the EyeToy USB Camera you really can see yourself (and as many as three friends) on screen, games like bomb hockey enable you to smash the puck into your opponents net and knock their monkey characters off their feet! The EyeToy Camera projects the players onto the screens to physically interact with the characters and environments of the game in real-time and players can use any part of their body to control the action.  The mini games can be played either on their own or from within the board game and are full of cheekiness synonymous with these monkeys, the games range from guiding a huge snowball along a mountain path, to running like the wind or jamming with your mates in a music session. You can even encourage your in-game character to eat his bananas in class and risk the wrath of the teacher!
