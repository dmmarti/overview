 In Barbie Horse Adventures: Wild Horse Rescue, a bunch of horses have been frightened by a lightning storm and Barbie must go round them back up.  Her horse serves to move her around the terrain, but she must get off to do much else.  The storm also knocked some things down, so she must climb or clear obstacles to access certain areas.  When she finds a horse, she must pet it to calm it down if it's a foal, or lasso a bigger horse, then lead it to a hitching post and call the stable on her cell phone.  There are also coins to find which can be used to buy new outfits for Barbie or her horse.  The object of the game is to rescue all the horses and complete Barbie's wardrobe.
