 The official game of the premier poker tournament, World Series Of Poker allows you to take on some of the greatest poker players in 26 different poker games, earn WSOP bracelets and earn a place in the "WSOP Hall of Fame".  During tournaments, you take part in several tables en route to the final table. Each table consists of 8 players that are automatically replenished with new players when numbers dwindle. Once the tournament is down to the last 16, you move onto the "featured table", and once down to the last 8, you move onto the final table, where the winner will be decided.  Several famous poker players make an appearance in game including Chris "Jesus" Ferguson, Men the Master and Jennifer Tilly.
