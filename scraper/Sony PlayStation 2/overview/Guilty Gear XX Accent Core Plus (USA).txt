 Λ Core Plus (Accent Core Plus) is a major update of Guilty Gear XX Λ Core. The game includes a wide array of balance and gameplay tweaks and bugfixes. Kliff Undersn and Justice have been added back in as playable characters, Mission and Survival modes have been added, and a new Story mode has been added. The story picks up directly after the events of Guilty Gear XX, and includes a unique story path for each of the playable characters.  The PS2 version is available as both a stand-alone release and an "append" disc that requires the original Λ Core. The PSP version adds a 3-on-3 tag match mode, while the PS3 and Xbox 360 releases add online play.
