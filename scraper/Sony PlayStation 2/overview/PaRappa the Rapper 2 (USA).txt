 PaRappa The Rapper 2 is the sequel to PaRappa The Rapper.  Defeat the Noodle Syndicate by rapping your way through various levels. On each level there is a teacher that raps a phrase, and you repeat each phrase by tapping various combinations of buttons in response to the teacher.    The game is mostly a single player game, but after you finish a level, you can return to it and play Head-2-Head with the computer or another player.  Your friends from the first game are back, including Sunny Funny (the girl of your dreams), Moosesha and Chop Chop Master Onion.   And don't forget.... You Gotta Believe!
