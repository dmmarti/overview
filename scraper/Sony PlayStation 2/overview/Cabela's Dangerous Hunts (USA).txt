 Cabela's Dangerous Hunts is a hunting game with adrenaline - hunt or be hunted!  Many of the animals you'll be after are dangerous and aggressive and will take you one-on-one - and you'll be armed with a primary weapon as well as a knife or pistol for close combat defense. You'll hunt for 27 animals in 12 regions. Animals include dangerous species such as bears, wolves, leopards, rhinos and cape buffalo; big game species such as moose, bighorn, mountain goat, elk and caribou; and exotic species such as impala, duiker and kudu.  The regions include British Columbia, Colorado, New Mexico, Tanzania and Zimbabwe. Game modes include Quick Hunt (one tag, one animal, one region), Action Zone (warp from location to location, where dangerous animals are waiting to attack you), and Career Hunt (a series of missions where you have some choice as to which task you'll take on next, and unlock chartered hunts).
