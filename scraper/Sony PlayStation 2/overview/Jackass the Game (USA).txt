 The Jackass crew (minus Bam Margera) is in a jam, while getting ready to begin shooting for their much anticipated TV return, their one and only camera man is injured and it is up to you to get the show going. Take over as your favorite Jackass characters in a series of stunts to earn money to complete the episodes and get footage for the new season.  To earn money, complete certain tasks or injure yourself which will pay big money, once you earn enough money, your episode will be complete and you can move on to another. Completing episodes will unlock other characters, you get to start out with the core players (Johnny Knoxville, Steve-O, Ryan Dunn and Chris Pontius), while Wee-Man has his own mini-games, called Wee-Games which have ones like Roof Top Cart Stop, Poo Shower and Wee Tattoo.  Once you complete a stunt in MTV Story mode, you can replay it in Challenge mode and replay the level with new challenges, doing so will earn you more money that you can earn in Jackass-Mart, to unlock costumes, props, more characters to play and classic clips from the TV show. You can also go head to head with a buddy in the Wee Games or compete in a Round Robin up to four players (PS2). The PSP version offers multiplayer through WiFi. Crazy game with a ton of fun stunts to play and has an insane injury system which ranges from anything like turf burn all the way up to broken necks.  The PSP version supports the editing and exporting of replays. The PS2 version contains more detailed environments, including pedestrians to annoy during the stunts, and an expanded Bail-Out feature, where points are scored based on how many injuries the character sustains.
