 Jonny Moseley Mad Trix is an extreme skiing game, in the vein of Tony Hawk's Pro Skater and Dave Mirra Freestyle BMX.  As Jonny Moseley, or a number of other real-life skiers, you must perform various stunts, of which there are hundreds, to attract the attention of movie studio's, ultimately to film you on runs.  There are two modes of play; Slopestyle, where you can go down hills and perform stunts without any mission goals or other distractions, and Big Mountain, where you perform tricks to star in a ski movie.  By performing good tricks, you will be able to see your run on the andquot;big screenandquot;.  In Big Mountain mode, you will ski down several real-life mountains, including Everest, Kilimanjaro, and the Alaskan mountains.  In Slopestyle, head down fictional environments, like a snowed-in San Francisco, Washington D.C., and Las Vegas.
