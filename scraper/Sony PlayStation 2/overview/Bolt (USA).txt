 Bolt is based on the animated movie of the same name. It stars the dog Bolt, who plays a dog with super powers on a TV show, and his owner Penny. However, the movie does not follow the story of the movie (Bolt starts to believe his super powers are real), but completely takes place within the fictional TV series. The plot is about rescuing Penny's father who was kidnapped by the evil Dr. Calisto.  While playing through the 25 missions, the control regularly switches between Bolt and Penny. Bolt's sections are focused on melee combat: Bolt use both super powers (limited by an energy bar) and regular attacks while fighting against multiple enemies at once.
