 War Jetz is the much-anticipated sequel to 3DO's World Destruction League: Thunder Tanks. Instead of cruising around 3-D landscapes in your tank looking for your opponents you can now think in 4 dimensions. You now have the ability to hop into the cockpit of several futuristic air combat machines in this next step in WDL history.
