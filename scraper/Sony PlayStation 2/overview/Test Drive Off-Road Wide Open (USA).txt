 This is the successor to Test Drive: Off-Road 3. In this game, the player controls one of 13 American Four By Fours through Hawaii, Moab, or Yosemite to be crowned King of The Off-Road. The player can race in a single, arcade race, take a complete free ride, or race in career mode. There are three kinds of racing to master: Circuit, Blitz, and Scramble.  Circuit Races are exactly as they sound. The player howls around a course through checkpoints before time runs out at least twice.  Blitz Races are considerably shorter than Circuit Races. The strategy for racing itself is not much different, except the race is in a linear fashion of point A-to-B.  In Scramble Races the player roars around an area "collecting" checkpoints in a random location as fast as possible. These are the shortest races in the game.  This game can be played by two players.
