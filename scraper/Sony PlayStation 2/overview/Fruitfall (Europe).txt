 The objective is to make the fruit disappear by moving them around the grid until they are grouped together - fruit must be either above or to the left or right of another fruit, diagonals do not count. The fruit can be moved by rotating the play area and allowing the fruit to fall thereby creating groups of three or more of the same fruit, which will then be removed, a bonus is awarded If more than one group disappears on one turn
