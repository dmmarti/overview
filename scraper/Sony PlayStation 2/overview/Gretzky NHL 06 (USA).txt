 Gretzky NHL 06 is another in the long line of hockey games and a line of Gretzky licensed games, this one featuring the obligatory roster updates and games modes, exhibition, season mode and a new feature called "99 mode".  In "99 mode" the player can sign Wayne Gretzky as a free agent for any team they play for, filling up a meter during the game, once it is full they can activate "99 mode" and bring Gretzky into the game.
