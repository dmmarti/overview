 MLB 2K5 is the first in the series of 2K games, taking over from it's Sega predecessor, ESPN Major League Baseball. This one has been completely revamped with brand new control schemes and a new graphics engine.  It features brand new animations and added a great deal of detail to the players, stadiums, weather and even cut scenes.  It also featured the obligatory updated roster as well as the standard modes such as exhibition, season and home run derby and also had online capabilities that could support up 30 players.  ESPN was also involved, lending their name to the title and broadcast style with commentators Jon Miller, Joe Morgan and Karl Ravech.
