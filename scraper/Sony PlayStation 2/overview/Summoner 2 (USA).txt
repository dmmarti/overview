 In the previous game, Summoner, Joseph became the god Urath, reborn by uniting the eight rings of summoning. Joseph’s culture hated the goddess Laharah and called her the “goddess of death.”  This sequel takes place twenty years later in the realms of Halassar, Galdyr and Munari City which are across the world. You play Maia, who is the incarnate of the goddess Laharah and the powerful Queen of the realm of Halassar. Unlike Joseph’s kinship, Maia’s people worship Laharah as a benevolent creator. Maia was born with the mark of prophecy, her fate being written in the Book of Prophecy. From the beginning, she has welcomed her destiny and knows that she must fulfill the prophecy. What is unknown to her is the path she must follow to do so.  Instead of summoning creatures to fight side-by-side with Maia, she actually becomes the demon when it is summoned. Three characters can be part of Maia’s party at one time and AI scripts can be assigned to each. Different characters are introduced as the story progresses and Maia’s skills improve. You can also choose to adventure in “solo-mode”, leaving your party members behind to go on alone.   If you played the first game, you will notice immediately that Summoner 2 has a different combat system. Each button press results in the swing of your weapon so that you have more control over the action during battles.  Unlike the first game, Summoner 2 was not released for Windows.
