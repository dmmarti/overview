 Hugo the Troll's new videogame adventure Cannon Cruise is a rough and tumble sea battle. The game is a mission-based action adventure where you are the captain of your own specially designed ship, you get to navigate the open sea at full sail with a powerful cannon and an appetite for destruction! The game, skewwed for younger gamers, if filled with wild weather, radical waves, and a wacky range of weapons, as you engage in gripping battles against pirate ships, roman destroyers, a fleet of catapult towers and many other sea-going vessels.
