 As the inevitable expansion pack for the first Samurai Warriors game, Xtreme Legends adds four new characters, a new campaign, more weapons and items, and gameplay tweaks.  Although it can be played standalone, half the point is to replay the original Samurai Warriors for the new content.  SW:XL also contains an archive feature, to learn more about the characters and history.
