 MotoGP 4 is a motorcycle racing game based on the 2004 MotoGP season. It features all the riders and tracks from the season, not just from the main MotoGP class but from the development 125cc and 250cc series. As well as the usual arcade mode where the player can select any rider and track to race on and season modes where a player must take part in all 16 races of a season, there is a challenges mode where the aim is to complete some objective (race win, lap time, win a championship etc.) of which there are 125 in all. Different levels of difficulty relating to the realism of the bikes handling, performance and brake assistance are offered to cater for both novice and more experienced players. All the usual setup options are available to tune your bike for each track. The game also features the ability for up to eight players to take part in an online race.
