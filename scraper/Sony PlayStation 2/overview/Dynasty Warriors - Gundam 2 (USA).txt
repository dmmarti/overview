 Dynasty Warriors: Gundam offers the typical hack-and-slash gameplay action from the Koei series, except that instead of Chinese generals, the player pilots Gundam mobile suits from the anime series. The game follow the third-person battle tradition of the Dynasty Warriors series, allowing the player to slice and shoot hundreds of enemy mobile suits per level.    Two different campaigns choices (one following the series history and another being a new original story) are available. Changes to the series include the ability to hover and fly, change suits between battles, and of course, inhabiting the fiction of the Gundam universe.  The PS2 port (Japan only) features new scenarios and mobile suits.
