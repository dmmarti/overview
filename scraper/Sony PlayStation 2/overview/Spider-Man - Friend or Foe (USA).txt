 Friend? Foe? Why not both?  In Spider-Man: Friend or Foe, Spider-Man must confront some of his most famous enemies to vanquish an even greater threat. Battle against characters such as Doctor Octopus, Venom and the Green Goblin - then add them to your list of allies!  Inspired by events of the movie trilogy, Spider-Man: Friend or Foe is a non-stop action adventure with a humorous twist that lets you recruit foes from the webslinger's rogue's gallery and use them in single-player levels, or co-op versus modes.
