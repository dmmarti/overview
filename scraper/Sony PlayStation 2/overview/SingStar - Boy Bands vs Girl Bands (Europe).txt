 SingStar Boybands vs Girlbands is a karaoke game, featuring hit songs by boybands and girlbands. The theme of the game was chosen by the public after a poll on the official website, the UK myspace and Facebook.  The game gives points which are distributed by the purity of singing, as in how well does one manage to stay on tune. It doesn't matter if you change octaves in the middle of the song or what words are you singing in (it doesn't have a word recognition), so your singing is rated by how well you manage to hit the correct note at the correct time.
