 Mega Man returns in yet another Mega Man X game. This time the camera is vastly improved and there is a good mix of 2D and 3D action. Unlike X7 the game is mostly 2D. Returning to the series is an rpg-like upgrade system. Axl and Zero have also return, however Axl cannot run and shoot anymore. The loading times are vastly improved. The game has a quicker pace and multiple endings. However keep in mind that there are occasional slowdowns.
