 Take to the track on the greatest 2-stroke and 4-stroke motorbikes in the world, as you attempt to win the world motorcycle championship.  Choose from Arcade (a simple game of motogp, with a set amount of laps on any of the tracks in the game), Season (attempt to win the world title by challenging the other riders in the field over a course of tracks in all types of weather conditions), Challenge (tricky mini games that have you attempting to complete certain events, such as beating a certain time through a particular area of track, etc.), and Time Trial (the simple test your skill and beat the clock mode).  You can also choose to turn on or off simulation mode, which when turned on allows you to simulate real life situations, such as falling off from turning to sharply and collisions), as well as tune up your chosen bike, from suspension to brakes and much more.
