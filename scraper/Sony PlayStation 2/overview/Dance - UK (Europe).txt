 Dance:UK takes the standard 'bemani' formula - arrows appear rhythmically on screen and the player must hit the corresponding button (on either a dance mat peripheral or the standard PS/PS2 controller) in time with these arrows and the music. Points are awarded for accuracy with extras for making certain 'combos' (mini-routines within a song which are deemed especially difficult or long).  The PS2 version of the game has 30 tracks (around 20 of which are famous/original) by artists including Misteeq, Run D.M.C, Liberty X, Sugababes, Room 5, Sophie Ellis Bextor, Chic, The Trammps, 5ive, Junior Senior, Las Ketchup and DJ Sammy.  There are initially three difficulty levels, and the player can either practise one song at a time (in Jukebox mode) or enter the Dance:UK Championship, winning which will unlock a 'Dance Recorder' mode in which players can record their own dance routines. In multiplayer up to 8 players can compete in succession or 2 players can compete head-to-head.  A karaoke mode is also provided for use with a wireless microphone (sold separately) whilst 'Aerobic' Mode calculates the number of calories you've burnt during play.
