 Victorious Boxers 2: Fighting Spirit is a boxing game based on the manga Hajime no Ippo. It holds 81 playable characters from the manga, such as Ippo himself, Ippo's coach both young and old, the bear Takamura fights, as well as any other character that was in the manga up until Takamura's match with David Eagle. You also get to face most of these characters in the Story Mode, which features almost every match from the manga up until, again, Takamura's match with David Eagle.  The controls allows jabs, straights, hooks and uppercuts to be thrown at the enemy, and swaying and dodging is done by holding down one button while steering the character. The characters with special attacks are equipped with these and the specials are thrown by holding down a button and pressing a corresponding punch button, but watch your stamina or you'll be too slow to hit your opponent.
