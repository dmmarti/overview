 Tokyo Xtreme Racer 3 improves over its 2001 racing predecessor Tokyo Xtreme Racer Zero through new highways, new cars and a new graphics engine. The gameplay remains the same, as the player has to find his rivals on the highways and challenge them to a battle. In this edition there are over 600 rivals to beat on three different highways including Tokyo, and two newcomers: Osaka and Nagoya. It also contains a number of licensed cars, new to the series.
