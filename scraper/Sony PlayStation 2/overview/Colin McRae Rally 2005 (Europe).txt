 The fifth iteration of the rally racing game inspired by the "Flying Scotsman".  Choose from over 30 car models.  The detail and physics are improved, and more playing modes are available, including a new around-the-world career mode.  Weather conditions and rally courses can both be customized.  Network play supports up to eight players with split-screen.  As always, the menu design is clean, and the tracks are dirty!
