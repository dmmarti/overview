 The evil Wizard/Jester Dhoulmagus came to the Kingdom of Trodain seeking a powerful magical scepter sealed beneath the Castle. Using the power of the scepter, Dhoulmagus destroyed the Castle of Trodain, placed a curse upon the Kingdom and its people, and turned King Trode and the Princess into beasts.   You play as the sole surviving castle guard, who journeys with the King, Princess and a reformed bandit named Yangus in search of the evil wizard and a way to break the curse. Along the way you will gain new allies, fight monsters, delve into deep dungeons, and perform heroic deeds.  Stylistically, this game is a blend of old and new. It is, at the core, a very traditional RPG; there is a lot of combat, and leveling up takes some work; you start out very weak, at 1st level, with no healing spells; there is strong differentiation between character classes; you heal at the inn, but can only save at a church; etc. On the surface there are a number of more modern refinements, however, including voice acting, 3D graphics, very complex enemies, animated menus and battle scenes, etc.   This game, the eighth in the series, is the first installment of Dragon Quest/Dragon Warrior available for the PS2. It features a huge, lush world with full day and night cycles. Series artist and Dragonball/Z creator Akira Toriyama designed the gameâ€™s anime style, 3D, cell-shaded characters and monsters. Music was composed by Koichi Sugiyama.  The international version features several updates to the original Japanese version, including voice-acting, graphic menu, symphonic soundtracks, and flashier effects.
