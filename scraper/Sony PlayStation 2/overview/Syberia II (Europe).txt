 You find Kate Walker continuing her journey exactly where the first game, Syberia, ended. Rather than return to her life as a New York attorney, Kate chooses to journey with Hans Voralberg to the frozen northlands of Syberia aboard his futuristic train.  Kate, Hans and Oscar, the humorous automaton, will travel through four locations on their way to the mythical Syberia, where Hans believes the ancient mammoth race still exists. As the threesome make their way through the harsh, but beautiful, wintery landscapes, many obstacles will get in their way. Talk to people Kate meets and solve situation, inventory-based and mechanical puzzles.  Graphically rich environments, an original musical score as well as animated scenery and objects top the features in this point-and-click "pure" adventure game.
