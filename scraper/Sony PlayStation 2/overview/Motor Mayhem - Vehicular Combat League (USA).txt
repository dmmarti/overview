 Motor Mayhem is a game based on the concept of a violent and futuristic motor-sport event.  The player directly controls a customized combat vehicle in a land-based arena and battles against another player or computer controlled opponents.  Each vehicle has a distinctive character and unique special attacks.  Each themed arena has additional weapons and upgrades for the vehicles to pick up.  Points are awarded for the destruction of an enemy vehicle.  The first contestant to achieve a target score, or that has the highest score when time expires, is the winner.
