 After leaving San Andreas and going on a crime spree throughout the country, Claude Speed and Catalina head to Liberty City for a life of crime.  During a bank heist, Claude is betrayed by Catalina and her Colombian friend Miguel, and he is shot by her just as they are leaving the scene of the crime.  Claude fully recovers....in a prison cell. However, while being transported to a prison, Colombians ambush the prison van for an inmate riding with Claude.  Claude and his friend, 8-Ball, escape in the process.  Now it is time for revenge.  Claude slowly rises through the ranks of the local gangs, gaining trust from local mob bosses and turning on others.  Claude gains influence, trust, and most importantly, money along the way.  It is time for Claude to rise from the dead and get revenge for what Catalina has done.  The concept that makes GTA what it is, is now in 3D in this release.  The game puts you in the shoes of a vicious, albeit novice, criminal. Traditionally, your missions center on the gangs inhabiting the city - each one always has jobs for you to perform, and your prosperity as a criminal depends on your ability to manipulate each gang. Ice a few members of one gang, and you'll gain its rival's favor. Jobs range anywhere from running dope and taking out rivals to sabotage and kidnapping.  Strictly for the matured.
