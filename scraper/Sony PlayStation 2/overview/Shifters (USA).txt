 The Castle of Bylandria is under attack by The Grand Inquisitor and his army of able-bodied soldiers. Bent on victory, The Grand Inquisitor uses his magic to transform his army into terrifying bestial soldiers. Desperate for survival, King Abelard summons, Allerion, a masked knight, to the aid of Bylandria. In order to save the king's kingdom, Allerion must travel through a vast array of lands to finally bring down The Grand Inquisitor and his army once and for all.  Shifters is a third person RPG set in the Might and Magic universe. This is a typical RPG with a slight twist. Allerion is able to shift into a number of different creatures, such as genies, and classes, such as warlord. Each level is sectioned into small areas, some of which are filled with secret areas and available sidequests. In addition to the three level up categories (mind, body, soul), you can choose to level up your shifted forms in order to make them more powerful and unlock different classes.
