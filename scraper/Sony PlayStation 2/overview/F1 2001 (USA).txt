 Officially licensed Formula 1 racer for the 2001 GP season featuring every car, driver, and track featured in the real life Formula 1 season.   The game boasts new physics and graphics engines which actually model and take into account track irregularities and bumps, and add some extras like fully animated 3D pit crews. Game modes available are the same as in last year's edition (Quick Race, Test Day, Multiplayer, Grand Prix and Championship) with the addition of the new "Driving School" mode, plus a series of brand new driving aids.
