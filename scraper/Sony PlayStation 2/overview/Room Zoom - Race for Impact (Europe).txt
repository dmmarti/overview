 Originally known as Out of Control Racing and then Micro Mayhem, Room Zoom lets you race indoor rallies with miniature cars. Zip over the bed, the bathroom sink, or the kitchen table, spin out on ketchup, get blown away by household fans, and combat your opponents for the cup. Use loops, ramps and banking curves to speed around the house or go off-road and find high speed challenges in eight fully interactive environments with three tracks each. Features include Free Drive, Track Edit Battle, Time Trial, and multiplayer, 15 cars to choose from, four power-ups (fire, ice, water and nitro), and boss level stages.
