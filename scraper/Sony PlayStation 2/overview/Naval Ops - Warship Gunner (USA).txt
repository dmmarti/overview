 Build a ship, sail into the heart of enemy waters and put it to the test. Strike deep, strike quick and strike hard and you may prove competent enough to succeed. Choose the wrong weapons, lose sight of the enemy and not take time to protect your ship from enemy fire and you will be swimming with the fishes.  Choose from one of multiple gameplay modes, including Survival Mode and World War II mode and equip yourself from a complete array of weapons: from the mighty guns of World War II to present day weapon systems and beyond.
