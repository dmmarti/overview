 NASCAR returns with a new roster of drivers and features in NASCAR 07. The gameplay and available modes are fairly identical to the previous game (including the team racing controls), but the pace has been kicked up a notch, with an added blur effect to enhance the sense of speed. A new feature is the Adrenaline meter. When full, it offers improved handling and speed. Drivers now carry ranks with different attributes (Dynamic Driver Attributes) and racing tendencies. Specific drivers will perform better on certain tracks. Players can earn skill points to improve their attributes by keeping a lead, making clean passes, intimidation or survive dangerous situations.  The main modes are Race Now, Season Mode, Chase for the Cup, Fight to the Top (Whelen Modified series, Craftsman Series, Craftsman Trucks, NBS, and NEXTEL Cup), Online Races (Quick Matches and Optimatch - where the host can fully define the event) and Dodge Challenges. The Dodge Speed Zone mode is no longer included. Important racers are shown in FMV interviews prior to Dodge Challenge races. As usual, the car can be tweaked and fine-tuned in many ways.  This is the first NASCAR game to appear on the PSP. It is fairly similar to the console versions, but does not include Total Team Control to talk with the team. The handheld version includes a new feature: Instant Rewind. While racing, a meter builds up with time, which can be used to rewind the game action when crashing or taking a bad turn. A few of the game modes are different.  Sterrance is featured on the US cover, as the driver for the #12 Alltel Dodge. The PAL release has Thomas's DeWalt Ford Fusion.
