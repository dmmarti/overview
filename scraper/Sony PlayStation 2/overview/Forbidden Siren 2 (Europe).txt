 The sequel to the Siren survival horror game puts you again in control of several characters. The game takes place on a island on the coast of Japan called Yamijima. The story begins when the characters have to dock to the island to survive the raging storm. 29 years earlier, all the island's inhabitants disappeared in a blackout and you will need to investigate this mystery.  The sequel adds new features in the game, which most notably you will notice, apart from the original Shibito zombies, as the new Yami Bito demons. The sequel also has a new alert system which functions through the controller's vibration function and alerts you of any nearby danger.  Stealth plays an important role, as well as light and darkness, as the creatures are sensitive to it in different ways. Just like in the previous game, you can sight-jack enemies and animals, to view the environment through their eyes. There are over 30 weapons to collect and there are three difficulty options.
