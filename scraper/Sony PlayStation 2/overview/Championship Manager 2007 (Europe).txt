 The console version of Championship Manager 2007 is in many ways similar to the PC version. Like previous editions the player takes on the role of a football club manager and has to perform tasks like taking charge of tactics, training, signing new players, negotiating contracts etc.  The game features over 60 different competitions in 26 different countries. The player is free to choose a team from any of these competitions. Another possibility is to manage national teams. Matches can be viewed in a quasi 3D view where players can select from various camera angles.
