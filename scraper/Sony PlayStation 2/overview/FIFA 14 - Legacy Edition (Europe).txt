 FIFA Manager 14: Legacy Edition is a re-release of FIFA Manager 13 with an updated database for the season 2013/2014. New are the licenses for the first leagues of Ukraine, Croatia and Czech Republic and some other licenses, e.g. the German third and fourth league, were removed. All gameplay features which had to be unlocked in FIFA Manager 13 are available from the beginning, a few texts were expanded (text mode, interview questions, etc.) and there is no Live Season anymore.
