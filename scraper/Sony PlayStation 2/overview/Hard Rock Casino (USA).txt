 Hard Rock Casino is a gambling simulation game which includes over 20 different gambling games including Slots, 5 various forms of Poker, Blackjack, Baccarat, Craps, Roulette and Pai Gow as well as horse race and sports betting.  There are four different casinos in which to play, each with its own games, house rules and table limits. Players start with a modest amount of money in the Hard Rock. The object is, naturally, to win lots more and earn a high enough reputation to be able to play in invitation-only tournaments and high stakes games. The major goal is to become the "Hard Rock High Roller".  There are unique, and sometimes influential, NPC characters to meet and play against, side tasks to complete, and unlockables for enhancing your customized character. The game also features a tutorial accessed from the main menu.
