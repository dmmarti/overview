 It's a futuristic, real-time 3D world on a microscopic scale, filled with cataclysms and catastrophes. Grab the controls of your shooter and accept missions to save the planet, or go for the classic Arcade Racing mode.  Features:  Futuristic 3D real-time environment.  Bonus system that allows players to win new weapons or defense systems and upgrade their vehicles.  A dozen evolutionary vessels (engines, armor etc.) are available for trying your luck on thirty plus circuits and eight different worlds.  In this fast-action game, players can choose among a dozen different vessels. Each vessel has its own strengths, characteristics and three active modes: Speed, Attack and Defense. As to be expected from all MegaRace titles, all of these ships are modular and, depending on the players results, can all be personlized. With a playerâ€™s winnings, different modules can be obtained to improve the engine charactertics, and/or upgrade the armor and weapons. Several game modes are available as well, such as a simple solo race, race with customizable ships, capture the flag and duel mode. All game modes can also be be played in network mode.
