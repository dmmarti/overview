 Hot Shots Golf 3 takes the series of detailed yet accessible golf simulations onto the PS2. The overall look and feel of the game is pretty much the same as it's predecessors, taking the PS2's extra power into account.  The same 'tap-tap-tap' system for hitting the ball is back.    There are a number of different courses, characters, clubs, and ball types to choose from.  New equipment can be purchased with experience points, which your characters earn by winning matches.  Better equipment will ease up the games difficulty a bit by providing greater accuracy, distance, and control.  As an addition feature, the game has an international ranking system of sorts.  With a password from the game you can post your scores on a website, where you can see how you measure up against everyone else out there.
