 Military robots cause havoc in a high tech Metropolis research facility. In Finland, genetically-engineered creatures take over the top secret Deep Space Communications Array.  A team of super powered criminals, having never worked together before, seize a Nevada missile base.  And deep beneath the surface of Mars, dozens of alien warriors are released from their long imprisonment…  These seemingly unrelated events prove to be pieces of a sinister plan, and it will take Earth’s greatest superheroes to stop it: The Justice League!  Justice League Heroes is an action game, also for two players cooperatively, based on the popular DC Comics series.  Control DC’s most popular heroes: Superman, Batman, Wonder Woman, Green Lantern, Martian Manhunter, The Flash, Zatanna and a handful of unlockable characters like Aquaman, Green Arrow, Hawkgirl, Huntress, Hal Jordan, and Kyle Rayner. In addition, the PSP version features exclusive unlockable heroes: Supergirl and Black Canary.  Players battle through famous locations such as Metropolis, S.T.A.R. labs, and for the first time, the Justice League's Watchtower.  Many of DC’s greatest villains face against our heroes including Braniac, Killer Frost, Darkseid, and Doomsday.  Boss battles are furious and unique, with no two defeated the same way.  Superpowers are developed through experience orbs collected from a wide range of enemies such as The White Martians, Brainiac’s assassin droids, and alternate-dimensional creatures.  Some special orbs known as “boosts” can enhance superpowers.  The boosts range from enhanced damage, efficiency, attack range, luck, speed, and super power duration.  Multiple boosts can combine into a single, more powerful boost.  Players can allocate their orbs and boosts to customize heroes to best suit their playing style.  Special shield icons placed throughout the game can be collected and spent to unlock characters and alternate costumes which affect the heroes' abilities as well their appearances.
