 Designed with the casual golf fan in mind, Eagle Eye Golf lets you play up to 4 players on 7 challenging courses in a variety of game modes such as Mission, Tournament, and even team-based games. The game also features a robust course editor where you can recreate some of the world's most famous courses with incredible accuracy or you can let your imagination run wild and design your own "out-of-this-world" fantasy courses. Also included is a mission mode featuring 100 tasks to clear and a training mode where you can choose your course and set the weather and wind. The game includes a robust character edit mode for creating your own character. You can make adjustments to clothing, hair style, body shape, voice and even shoes. Before finalizing your character, you assign points to various statistics, including power, control, impact, recovery, spin shot and fade/draw. These traits grow as you equip your character with items that you've unlocked in the mission mode.
