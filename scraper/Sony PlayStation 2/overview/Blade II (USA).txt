 In an adaptation of the "Blade II" movie, you take on the role of the daywalker Blade in his quest to rid the world of vampires.  Using weapons such as a pistol, shotgun, or just wooden stakes, you must control Blade to fight through every level's exit to the ultimate confrontation.  Determined to stop the vampires, Blade battles through three huge campaigns: The Arcan Mountain Base, Lairs of Buron, and Karkov Tower. Using martial arts and weapons, you'll try to defeat vampires and collect glyphs without getting yourself killed. If you need help, request a tutorial from your friend, Whistler.
