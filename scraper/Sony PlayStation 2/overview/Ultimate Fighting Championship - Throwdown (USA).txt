 UFC: Throwdown features genuine Ultimate Fighting Championship champions and all the unbelievable mixed martial-arts moves found in the Octagon. Using deep offensive and defensive strategies, players can string combos together and exploit the fighting techniques that most suit their personal styles. The 25 UFC fighters in the game include current UFC champions such as Tito Ortiz and exclusive newcomers such as Ricco Rodriguez. The game includes a brand-new ultra-extensive career mode that lets you create and train your fighter as he battles his way through gruelling tournaments and ultimately to the UFC main event. You can compete in all-new weight classes such as light heavyweight and welterweight, and ground and pound in a variety of arenas from the training room to a sold-out UFC championship arena. The eight-player tournament mode lets you set up single-elimination winner-takes-all matches. Increased variations in Create-a-Fighter mode include customization of the face, body, skin colour, clothes, hairstyle, and more.
