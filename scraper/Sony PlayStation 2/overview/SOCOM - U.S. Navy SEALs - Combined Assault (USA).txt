 Protect America and freedom from enemy forces in urban and rural warfare in SOCOM: U.S. Navy SEALs Combined Assault, exclusively for the PlayStation 2 computer entertainment system. SOCOM: U.S. Navy SEALs Combined Assault builds on the strengths of the multimillion-selling franchise to firmly establish both its single-player and multiplayer as equally outstanding game experiences. Created in association with U.S. Naval Special Warfare Command, SOCOM: U.S. Navy SEALs Combined Assault is as close as a player can get to being a Navy SEAL on PlayStation 2.  The PlayStation 2 system's top online gaming franchise continues its assault with an all-new 4-player cooperative play, improved enemy behaviour and tactics, and new vehicles and weapons for campaign mode. Command the most feared Special Forces team ever assembled through a single, massive Area of Operation with varied missions spanning across multiple diverse regions.  Players can experience the campaign mode in single player or in 4-player online cooperative mode. Additionally, players will have the option to select an individual tactical mission area that was previously completed, and play it as a stand-alone, or 'Instant Action', mission in 4-player online cooperative play. Players can then customize these Instant Action missions for nearly endless replay.  SOCOM: U.S. Navy SEALs Combined Assault will also contain the full SOCOM 3: U.S. Navy SEALs multiplayer online game with all maps, patches and updates included and it will be completely compatible with SOCOM 3 Online multiplayer. In addition it will feature new competitive 32-player maps, exclusive to SOCOM: U.S. Navy SEALs Combined Assault. Improved Crosstalk functionality between SOCOM: U.S. Navy SEALs Fireteam Bravo 2 and SOCOM: U.S. Navy SEALs Combined Assault allows each game to have even more dramatic effects on the progression of the other, in addition to unlocking special features across the titles.
