 The last game in the line of Silicon Dreams' Champions League licensed titles (and only released in European markets), Season 2001/2002 includes all 32 teams qualified for the competition plus all finalists since 1960. There is exclusive Champions League footage to be unlocked and the in-game commentary is done by Guy Mowbray, Barry Venison and Gabby Logan.  The game allows the player to participate in friendlies, Champions League matches, leagues and cup tournaments. You can also edit players and create teams with custom players. Tactics can be modified to suit the team's style and qualities. The gameplay remains close to the previous title, with free-flowing ball physics and the stress on accurate passing. The new changes mostly revolve around set pieces (it is now possible to aim to a player).   Graphically, it uses a new engine with features such as volumetric grass and real-time lighting.
