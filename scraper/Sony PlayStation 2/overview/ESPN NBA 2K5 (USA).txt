 New to this year's version is the "Association", which is a new feature of Franchise mode.  With it, Franchise mode features new simulation models and allows you to manage key attributes of your team, such as weekly training and team chemistry.  Franchise mode also gives you the ability to play games on a play-by-play basis, like a management game, while letting you control everything and giving you replays to see what happened.  Control wise, the game features the same Iso Motion as found in last year's title, but also gives you options depending on your player.  2K5 uses a new momentum system which factors the player's ability in deciding what he can do.  A short guy, who can't run very fast or jump very high, won't be able to score a lot of dunks.  24/7, the "story" mode of last year's game, has returned with some new features.  You get over one hundred new items, a respect system, the ability to play multiplayer games, and new timed mini-games.  Like all of the 2K5 titles, this one has the standard ESPN presentation, which includes camera angles, follow-cams, stat overlays, and running commentary.  Commentators include Michele Tafoya, who reports from the sideline, and Bill Walton, a hall of famer, as the commentator.  ESPN NBA 2K5 has online play over Xbox Live (Xbox only), as well as the PlayStation 2's online service.
