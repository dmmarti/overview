 Based on Sony Animation Studios's first movie, you play the character of Boog, a domesticated bear who tries to return to the civilization after being released in a nearby forest due to an unfortunate misadventure, and Elliot, a crazy deer who acts as the alter-ego of the bear.  In order to achieve its goal, Boog will have to prove itself to the creatures of the forest by helping them to get rid of the hunters. By gaining their respect, the creatures help you to reach its hometown.  Open Season is a game in third-person view. You control the main character in the forest and use the different forest creatures to resolve simple puzzles (considering the target age for the game) by throwing them. You can collect "achievement points" (not related to the Xbox 360 Achievement points) that the player will be able to use to unlock new abilities for Boog.
