 Dead To Rights is an action-game, straight out.  You play as Jack Slate, a police officer in Grant City.  On a routine call, you find a dead body; the body is your father.  Later framed, Jack becomes a fugitive, on the run from the law.  Your quest will take you to various places, from strip joints and hotels, to office complexes, and even prison... as an inmate.  Dead To Rights is an action game in every sense of the word.  When fighting, you have the opportunity to perform various moves, such as grabbing an enemy from behind and using him as a human shield, to tossing a fire extinguisher and shooting it, causing a huge explosion.  When against an enemy and you have no gun drawn, you can perform andquot;disarmandquot; moves, which causes your character to steal the enemy's gun, then performing some sort of finishes, such as a neck breaker.  Initially, only a few disarm moves are available, but more can be unlocked as your progress.  A unique addition in this game allows you to control Jack's best friend, and partner, Shadow, his K-9 dog.  Using Shadow, you can kill enemies from far away, and retrieve their gun in Shadow's jaws.  Dead To Rights features adrenaline combat, which is similar to that of andquot;Bullet-Timeandquot; from Max Payne.  You can perform slow-motion dives and spins, giving you an advantage, as long as your adrenaline holds out.
