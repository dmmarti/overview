 Crusty Demons is an extreme sports game based on the real-life stunt troupe of the same name.  Motorized vehicles such as motorcycles and cars are used in performing tricks on ramps, half-pipes and over open areas.  Large environments such as trailer parks and international cities like New York and Tokyo are available for the player to explore, do tricks and race.  The story of the videogame has the Crusty Demons meeting the Devil and agreeing to sign over their souls if given immortality.  However, the Crusty Demons want to renege on the deal once they find out that they can still feel pain when fatally injured.  The Devil, not without mercy, agree to offer back their souls on the condition that the Crusty Demons follow his every order and fulfill his demands for whatever stunt he asks of them.  Whenever a stunt goes fatally wrong, the games rag doll engine rewards the player with a graphic simulation of the collision or bail.  This is also conjoined with the appropriate blood splatter on the screen as well as x-rays that show whichever bones have broken.  Unlockables consist of pictures of "babes".
