 This game is the first entry in EA's NASCAR Thunder series, where players can choose from sixty different drivers including Jeff Gordon, Dale Earnhardt Jr., Jimmie Johnson, Mark Martin, Tony Stewart, Dale Jarrett, just to name a few.  There is an Quick Race mode where players can go against the computer or compete against three friends and can customize their options including turning yellow flags on or off, realistic damage and the length of races.  A 20 season Career Mode is also present that let's players build a car from scratch by choosing a number, paint scheme and up to four different sponsors.  As the player progresses through their career, they can use money earned from races to buy better parts to upgrade their car and land bigger sponsors, depending on if the player meets their sponsor's goals.  There are also options where player's can tweak their car to their liking including change air pressure of their tire's, gear ratios, the angle of their spoiler, among others, depending on which track they race on.  23 real-life tracks are present including Lowe's Motor Speedway, Watkins Glen International Speedway and even the famed Daytona Speedway, home of the Daytona 500.  Another feature lets the player race against the legend himself, Richard Petty, if they can win eight season championships.
