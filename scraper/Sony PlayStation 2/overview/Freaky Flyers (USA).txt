 This cartoon style racing game replaces the usual kart formula with planes (and all sorts of flying technology, such as UFO's, flying carpets and plenty more).   Choose from one of the many different, and wacky, characters and take to the sky over various locations, each with its own set of obstacles and shortcuts. Each character has a different level of ability (for example, one may be highly accurate in cornering but slow, while another is much faster but less responsive in turning).  Apart from the usual race modes, you can also take on a 4 player race (split-screen only).
