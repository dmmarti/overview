 In MotoGP 07 the player takes part in the official Dorna 2007 Moto GP season. The game contains 22 official bikes, 22 riders and 17 tracks from the licensed championship. There are several game modes to choose from, such as a full 2007 Moto GP season, a custom season, quick races, time attack, split-screen multiplayer and 100 individual challenges.  By winning challenges, the player can unlock official Moto GP videos and photos as a reward. The player can customize his riding experience by choosing from three preset riding models: Arcade, Advance, Simulation. Setting gameplay on "Arcade", the bike will be easier to control: front wheels will not lock during braking, the rider will not fall during powerslides and putting wheels on gras is not catastrophic. By setting gameplay on "Simulation", the player has to manage front and rear wheel locking during braking, and highsides and low sides during accelerations. The grass becomes more slippery. "Advance" is a mix between the Arcade and Simulation. There are also different weather types for each track.
