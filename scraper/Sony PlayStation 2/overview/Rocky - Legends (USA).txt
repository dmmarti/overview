 Be Rocky, Apollo Creed, Clubber Lang, or Ivan Drago in this fighting game prequel to the movie series.  Using classic Rocky characters, locations, and music, Rocky: Legends puts the player in the boxing, ring recreating or rewriting the careers of the boxing franchise's heroes and villains.    Play the career mode or jump into a 1-2 player slugfest. As you progress through the career mode, you must train to improve your skills just like a professional would, and use your fight purse to unlock more playable characters, arenas, movie trailers and more. Combinations of punches can be executed powerfully.
