 Kaido Racer is a fast-paced racing title that faithfully recreates highly dangerous courses from some of Japan's most famous mountain regions. Each race is fought against a number of computer-controlled drivers (or a friend in two-player mode), and mixes official daytime tournaments with more lucrative night-time events.  Kaido features four 'Battle' events that you must master in order to earn enough cash to upgrade your vehicle. In 'SP Battle', you must keep a special gauge as full as possible by staying in the lead and driving aggressively; 'CA Battle' rewards masterful drifting; 'FL/LF Battle' challenges you to either stay in first place, or claw your way to the front from last place; and 'TAC Battle' adds a strict time limit to SP Battle rules.  Kaido Racer also features a story mode where you'll meet rival drivers such as Slasher, Tricker and Lovers, all of whom have driving styles to reflect their personalities. You'll communicate with them via a simple simulated mail system, picking up tips and sending out challenges using the message boards.
