 A collection of minigames based loosely around the story of the film with the farmyard serving as a central hub that the player returns to after each minigame.  In total there are 19 minigames, in which the player is given control of 1 of the 3 main characters from the film. In the farmyard area, the player controls  Wilbur the Pig, where he must find various items throughout the farm whilst keeping out of sight of the farmer and his sheepdog. Once a task has been completed on the farmyard, the game then moves to a minigame based loosely on the events of the film. You can control Wilbur in a runaway pram rolling down a hill and must keep the pram balanced until it comes to rest. Some of the games let the player control Templeton the Rat. In one minigame he must hurl rubbish at incoming birds in a rubbish dump using a catapult hastily built from the materials lying nearby. In another he must outpace a runaway egg in some tunnels under the dirt. The last playable character is Charlotte herself. These games generally involve the barn as a backdrop (in a 2D setting)  with the goal of travelling from one side to the other by swinging from webs and dodging obstacles and catching flies.
