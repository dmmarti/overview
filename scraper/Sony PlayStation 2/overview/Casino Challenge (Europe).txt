 Casino Challenge is a single player compilation of mini casino games.  The player starts a game with Â£100 stake money and gambles away on either Horse-racing, Blackjack, Roulette or Slot Machines. The game has sixteen avatars to choose from and the player's winnings are ranked against the remaining fifteen in a league table. All the following games are played as single player games and Horse-racing: The player places win, place or show bets on races between five horses. When the bets are placed the game shows a video of real horses racing with commentary, winnings and losses are calculated and the player gets to do it all again.  Blackjack: This is a fairly standard single deck Blackjack game, blackjack pays 3 to 2, insurance pays 2 to 1, and there is no limit to the bet that can be made.  Roulette: Again a standard implementation that supports all the regular bets but has no preservation of the player's betting pattern.  Slot machines: There are three machines to choose from Cel Damage, Seek and Destroy, and Road Trip. The first two are single line machines while Road Trip has three winning lines and all machines support one, two or three pound bets
