 Resident Evil Outbreak returns you to the Umbrella Corporations disaster that consumed Racoon city. You play one of eight ordinary citizens of Racoon city attempting to survive the carnage caused by the T-Virus.   There are five different scenarios in this game. Initially only one is open to you, this is concerned with the outbreak in the city, but upon its completion further scenarios with different plots and locations become available.   Gameplay is similar to the previous Resident Evil games. It consists mainly of exploring, solving puzzles, finding items and of course surviving. This is also the first game of the resident evil franchise that can be played on-line, with up to four people playing cooperatively in order to survive.
