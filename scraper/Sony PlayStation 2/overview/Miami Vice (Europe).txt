 Based on the 80's TV series of the same name, this is a 3rd person shooter. Playing as Sonny Crockett or Ricardo Tubbs, the player must dismantle drug-lord Ortega's organization, following the plot of an episode of the series.  Through 14 missions, the player must take down (or arrest, sometimes) drug dealers and solve some minor puzzles (like finding keys to open doors, or switching levers to get access to locked places). In some stages, the player can choose freely to play as Crockett or Tubbs, switching between them by the click of a button. They have different abilities (Tubbs, for instance, is tougher and can kick in doors, Crockett is more agile), and different weapons (Crockett has a pistol as primary weapon, Tubbs has a double barreled shotgun). The characters can also carry a secondary weapon, from among 14 types (9mm pistols, .45 pistols, silenced 9mm, Uzi-like sub-machineguns, etc.). Each character can use only certain types of weapon, Tubbs carrying usually the heavier ones. The primary weapons have unlimited ammo, the secondary ones don't.  In the stages where the player can choose either Crockett or Tubbs, basic commands can be given to the secondary character, such as asking for following the partner or covering him. The characters will heal themselves as the time passes, and they can heal each other: if one of them dies, the other can revive him.  The characters can interact with the environment: whenever an action is possible, an icon will appear, showing which action can be taken, such as opening (or breaking) doors, climbing ladders, etc. Jumping is part of those particular actions, as the characters can only jump at specific places where the proper icon shows up. As for other actions, characters can run, crouch, walk and lean against walls. To shoot enemies, the player must aim (with an auto aim button) and then shoot (with a shoot button).  The game features the original theme from the TV show, as well as original voices.
