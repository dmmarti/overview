 Total Immersion Racing is a simulation concentrating on the GT / GTS and PRO (prototypes) classes racing series. Since these are official racing classes the game simulates circuit racing only.  A whole racing breed is presented to the player consisting of 14 racing cars ranging between the GT / GTS and Prototypes (PRO) classes, modeled and detailed according to the real models.  12 circuits are available in total, like Silverstone, Monza, Hockenheim and Talheimring among others.  Only a few of the circuits and the cars are available on initiation and the rest get unlocked upon the completion of several races and challenges later in the game.  The player can play the game in four different modes: via the career mode, the quick race mode, the time trial mode and the challenge mode.  During the career mode one has to compete a full season starting in a low spec GT car. The objective in the career mode is to win the seasons in order to gain contracts with better car teams and get promoted through the three classes.  The challenges are unified type of races which means that they are either same model cup races, same manufacturing country, same class etc. Winning one challenge unlocks the next till all 30 available get won.
