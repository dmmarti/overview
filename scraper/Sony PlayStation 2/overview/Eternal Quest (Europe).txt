 Eternal Quest takes the player to the land of swords, sorcery and maze-like underground lairs, in which they must defeat monsters, collect better equipment, acquire gold (to buy better equipment).  Descend lower in the game's 50 leveled dungeon in the story mode which is about a shogun who summons a champion (you) to save his shogunate from an evil presence once and for all.  The gameplay is very similar to Nethack, and other "roguelike" games. The game is turn based, and as you take a step, so does every monster in the level. When you're standing still, so does everything else in the game. Also, like in some "roguelike" games, levels in this one are randomly generated.
