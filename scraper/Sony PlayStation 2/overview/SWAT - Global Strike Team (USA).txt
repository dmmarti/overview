 SWAT: Global Strike Team is both a first person shooter and a strategy game since it combines the tactical strategic elements of SWAT 3 and the arcade action of Virtua Cop.  The SWAT: GST is an international, specialized squad whose main objective is to protect, defend and save the lives of the innocent. The storyline takes place five years in the future - in 2008, the year the GST was formed. As team leader Mathias Kincaid, formerly with US Army Delta Force, players will lead his squad all the way from basic training to full blown secret ops.   There are 21 single-player and 10 multiplayer-only co-op missions involving search and rescue operations against terrorist factions. Modes of play include: Campaign, Co-op, Free-for-all, Team Deathmatch, and Time Attack. Orders are issued to the team members by way of the controller interface or an optional voice recognition system with a communication headset. The game offers a variety of assault weapons plus tools, like night vision goggles.  A new engine was designed specifically for this game to provide realistic shadows and a film-like appearance through the use of special filters.
