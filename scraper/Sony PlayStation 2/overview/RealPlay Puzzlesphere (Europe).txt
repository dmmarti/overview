 REALPLAY Puzzlesphere is an action puzzle game in the vein of Marble Madness and Super Monkey Ball using the Realplay system of motion sensitive controllers. Included with a game is a motion sensitive orb that works much like a Wii Remote. If you tilt it in any direction the ball on screen will gather up momentum in that direction. The further you tilt it the more momentum it will gather. The goal of the game is to guide the ball on the screen through complex 3D courses where you have to avoid gaps, make jumps and roll around sharp corners. There are various checkpoints along the way that serve as respawn points and make sure the player doesn't cut short on the designated circuit. When the ball on screen falls out of bounds the player loses a life. He only receives a few lives for each level where he has to make do with. One additional control is the air brake that applies a sudden momentum in the exact opposite direction as the current rolling direction. This can be used for late escapes. To make it more difficult fans can try to blow you off course. A variety of power-ups can be collected to improve your air brake for example, but they are placed at hard to get locations.  The game comes with 36 levels in 6 different environments. There are four game modes: practice, arcade, time trial and 2-4 player time attack.
