 The first Total Nonstop Action Wrestling game based on the weekly television show of the same name, TNA iMPACT!.  Enter the six-sided ring as you take control of one of 25 TNA stars such as Kurt Angle, Jeff Jarrett, Rhino, Samoa Joe, AJ Styles, Sting, and Christian Cage. Each wrestler comes alive thanks to their participation in motion capturing and allowing actual scans of themselves to be used for the game in place of hand-painted textures for extra realism and detail.  TNA iMPACT tries to revive the older arcade style of wrestling game and is more about fast paced action while still offering multiple match types such as Standard, Tag Team, Free For All, Ultimate X, Submission, Handicap, and Falls Count anywhere. In addition to this you can play alone, or compete against your friends at home, or online  There is also a story mode in which you create your very own TNA wrestler with customisable costumes, move sets and such as you unfold the back-story of a former champion wrestler.  (unfortunately due to limitations with the PS2 and Wii create-a-wrestler and online functions are not available)
