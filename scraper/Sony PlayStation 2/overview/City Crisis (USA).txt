 City Crisis is a helicopter rescue game. Your goal in this game is to move your chopper from accident to accident and rescue people from burning buildings.  Your helicopter is also equipped with a fire-fighting water cannon to stop the blazes.  You are scored on how many people you manage to rescue, how much fire damage you prevent, and how quickly you complete all the mission objectives.  In addition to the standard rescue mode, City Crisis offers a chase mode.  In chase mode, you use your helicopter to assist the police in a car chase.  You have to keep your spotlight on the suspect's car until the police can stop them.   City Crisis also has a time-trial mode, where you have to fly your helicopter through a set of floating rings as fast as possible.
