 Victorious Boxers: Ippo's Road to Glory closely follows the manga "Hajime No Ippo". It is a straightforward boxing game, with buttons for jabs, hooks and uppercuts. You can also bob and weave with the analog sticks. During the career mode you play many different boxers, in the hopes of eventually winning the championship belt or to sometimes achieve a different story goal. It was followed by Victorious Boxers 2: Fighting Spirit.
