 Yoh Asakura is no ordinary junior high school student. In fact, he is a Shaman somebody with the power to communicate with ghosts and spirits. If ever he finds himself in trouble, Yoh can unite his power with another spirit to find success. All tremendous stuff to form the basis of a videogame, and helped along by the fact that Shaman King is fast becoming another global phenomenon for Konami along the lines of Yu-Gi-Oh! over 20 million comic books sold, and 165 million trading cards since launching in Japan back in 1998.  Throughout his adventures Yoh's main companion is the spirit of a 600-year old samurai warrior 'Amidamaru'. Together, their aim is to have Yoh crowned the 'Shaman King' in a grand tournament held once every 500 years. The game is played by first collecting spirits of defeated opponents, then using them to help Yoh in battle. Other so-called 'Guardian Ghosts' are summoned to fight alongside Yoh. As he fights, Yoh gains experience points to increase his powers, and those of the Guardian Ghosts. New moves, special attacks and combinations of attacks are the reward for skill and perseverance.  With Shaman King's popularity soaring around the world, the UK is about to get a hit of what is threatening to become the next animated super show. Can the ghosts and spirits help our hero become the Shaman King?
