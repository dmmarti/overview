 Going beyond the usual high speed thrills of the past Top Gear titles, Dare Devil has you racing a collection of smaller car designs, like the Mini and VW Beetle. The 27 levels offered are based on real world locations (Rome, Tokyo, San Francisco) and it is your job to race through the streets, collecting dare devil tokens in order to progress through to the next stage. Bonus points can be made from crashing into obstacles on the sides of the roads, like bus stops and seats.  You can also collect hidden keys and wrenches that offer extra lives and hidden stages, nitro boosts to give an extra dose of speed, and clocks to give you a little more time to accomplish to task. And you can race against a friend in split screen mode to see who can race their little speedster the best.
