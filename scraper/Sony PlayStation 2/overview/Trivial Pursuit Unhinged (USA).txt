 Welcome to Trivial Pursuit with a twist!  Play Trivial Pursuit in one of three ways with 1-6 friends either with you or online through GameSpy (PC) or your console's online system.  Choose to play in Classic, Unhinged, or Flash.  The classic game is just that, the standard Trivial Pursuit game.    Unhinged adds two additional features: special spaces (50/50 chance, teleport, board rotate, etc) and betting.  With betting, you can choose whether your opponent will answer correctly or incorrectly and bet 1-2 points.  These points can allow you to gain the ability to roll again if you don't like your roll.  Flash mode is for those who want a quick game.  There are 5 levels of the board.  You start on the first level and have a choice of 2 spaces.  Answer correctly and move up a level for another 2 spaces to choose from.  The first to the top wins.  Questions are asked from the 6 different categories depending on what space you are on.  Each question has a multiple choice selection of 4 possible answers to choose from.  The only exception is with the 50/50 spaces in Unhinged mode where there are only 2 possible answers to choose from.  The questions are read by famous people like Bill Nye the Science Guy and Whoopi Goldberg.  Every now and then, they will throw in other information relating to (or not) the question either before you answer, or after you answer.  They may also make comments about your inability to answer a question correctly.
