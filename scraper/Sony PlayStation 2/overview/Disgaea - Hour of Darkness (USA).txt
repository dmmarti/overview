 After a two-year sleep, Prince Laharl awakens to find his father, King Krichevskoy, dead and the Netherworld in the middle of a civil war over who takes the throne. Not willing to give up his rightful place as the next king, Laharl joins with his subordinate Etna and her underlings to fight back.  In a similar style to Final Fantasy Tactics and Ogre Battle, Disgaea is a combination of RPG myth and magic with a turn-based strategy overview. Various menu systems open you up to strategies, weapons and technology, as well as a magic spell or two, to get the job done.
