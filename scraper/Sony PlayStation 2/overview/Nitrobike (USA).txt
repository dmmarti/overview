 Nitrobike is a take on the classic game of Excitebike, where the player takes the helm of a motorbike equipped with a nitro rocket, racing in 20 different tracks and over 60+ different events.  The player must avoid stationary obstacles and slower riders.  There is career mode where the player can unlock new characters and bikes by winning these events and a six-player online capability.  The controls mostly consist of using the Wii remote to steer and accelerate as well as boosting with the nitro rocket.  There is also a four-player bowling game where players can hurl their rider at a set of huge bowling pins.
