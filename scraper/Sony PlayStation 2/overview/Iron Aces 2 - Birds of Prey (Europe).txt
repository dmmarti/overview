 The first Iron Aces game took place using World War II era planes. Iron Aces 2: Birds of Prey ignores this limitation and lets the player choose from a variety of fighters including the first jets and missile-armed fighters... right up to the F/A-18 Hornet. The player can fly these fighters on a variety of objective-based missions or set the fighters loose in Free Battle Mode and place any plane type against any other.
