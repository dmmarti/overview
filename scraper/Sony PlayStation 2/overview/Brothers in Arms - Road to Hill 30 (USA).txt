 Brothers in Arms, one of the few games to truly be based on actual events, places you in the shoes of real-life World War II Sergeant Matt Baker, tasked with commanding your squad through a week's worth of actual battles that Baker's 101st Airborne platoon faced. Combining the cinematic action of games such as Medal of Honor and Call of Duty with the strategic command of Full Spectrum Warrior, you must command your troops to use actual army doctrine to find, fix, flank, and finish the enemy while actually participating in the battle yourself.
