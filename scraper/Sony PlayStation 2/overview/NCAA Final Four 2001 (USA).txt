 The continuation of 989 Sports long running NCAA basketball franchise and the first for the PS2, once again returns with 31 NCAA Division 1-A schools along with over 300 of the top teams of the time.  Once again the obligatory game modes apply such as Exhibition, Season, Playoffs, etc.  It also features authentic motion capturing and 3D rendered character models of the top stars of the time to give it a more realistic feel.  A shooting meter has also been added to give players a better chance at both shooting and free-throws.  Quinn Buckner also makes an appearance to lend his voice for play-by-play commentary.
