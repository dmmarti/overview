 What started as a simple report of strange lights at an abandoned school has become something much more for rookie cop Lazarus Jones. After unwittingly unleashing hundreds of ghosts from a containment facility, including one that took a liking to Lazarus' partner, it's now his job to travel to the four corners of the earth and recapture them. This is going to be one long night.  Lazarus starts the game with a pistol, but bullets aren't much use against the incorporeal. Eventually he will find energy weapons that can drain away a ghost's energy, and when a ghost has been sufficiently weakened it can be captured with Lazarus' homing "Ghost Grenade". Not all the monsters Lazarus faces are the undead, however, and more solid foes can be dispatched the traditional way: shooting them until they stop moving. Levels are traveled through sequentially and range from flooded bayous to a sunken battleship and abandoned prison island. Sometimes Lazarus will be assisted by a mute ghost named Astral who can reach areas beyond Lazarus and open paths for him. She has to be careful however as she has no way to attack or defend herself.
