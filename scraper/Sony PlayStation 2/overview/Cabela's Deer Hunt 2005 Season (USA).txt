 This sequel to Cabela's Deer Hunt 2004 Season really is more than a sequel. Improved technology gives much bigger levels with more trees and vegetation, as well as much better animal AI. 18 new missions really add to gameplay, as do the clay shooting challenges. 9 deer species across North America will give any virtual hunter hours of entertainment.
