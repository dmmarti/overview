 Celebrate 15 years with Mega Man!  This compilation edition of the Blue Bomber celebrates Mega Man 1-8, as well as two arcade games that were never before released in America (Mega Man: Power Battles and Mega Man: Power Fighters).  Each game in the series follows Mega Man as he and his robot dog Rush (introduced in the third game) battle against Dr. Wily and his robot henchmen.  Each game is presented in their entirety, with an optional "Navi Mode" to change the user interface to closer match Mega Man 8.  As players complete the games, new unlockables will become available, revealing history and artwork of Mega Man's past adventures.
