 Earth's population has grown, and because of this, humongous skyscrapers have been erected.  The rich and average live in these skyscrapers, while the poor, deranged, illegal and criminals live at the very bottom, in the scummy area.  The only time people go do down there is to do foundation maintenance.  Recently, a team of engineers has gone missing at the "Real Meat Factory", and the UPA team is sent in.  Project Eden puts you in command of four members of the UPA squad, each with different abilities that are required for the mission.  The game also contains a multiplayer mode, allowing you to play from two to four players in a cooperative or deathmatch game.
