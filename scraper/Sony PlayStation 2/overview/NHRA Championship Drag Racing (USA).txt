Take on superstar Greg Anderson of the Pro Stock division, the perennial powerhouse Tony Schumacher of the Top Fuel Dragsters or take on the legendary Funny Car driver John Force.  Choose a sponsor and hire a crew chief to set up your car or if your feeling confident, tune the car your way. Get it right, you win, get the big sponsors, the best equipment and become champion. Get one thing wrong... and meet Mr. Wall and see your car torn up in painful slo-mo.
