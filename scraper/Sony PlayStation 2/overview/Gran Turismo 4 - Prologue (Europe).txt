 Gran Turismo 4: Prologue is a lite version of the later released game Gran Turismo 4. In reality, this game, although a full game in its own right, is really nothing more than a extended demo of what to expect in the final release of Gran Turismo 4.  The game features two modes:   1. Arcade: there are five brand new tracks to sample, four tarmac, and one rally course. The player may either choose to race against opponents or the clock in this mode; School Mode: is where the game is at. This is where players can accumulate new cars by completing the task. School Mode is simply the License Mode from the previous games. This mode involves the user having to complete either a number of laps, or a segment or track within a certain time limit. The player is then graded as Gold, Silver, and Bronze of Fail.
