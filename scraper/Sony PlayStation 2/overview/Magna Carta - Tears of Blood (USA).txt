 The land of Efferia is a huge continent, where five different races co-exist - alas, not always peacefully. At present, humans and a race called Yasons are having a prolonged conflict. The hero of the game, a young adventurer named Calintz, comes back to his hometown, only to discover that it was destroyed by enemies. Thinking only about revenge, Calintz embarks on a journey that will eventually force him to get involved in the world of conflicts, wars, and intrigues.   This RPG, developed by the Korean company SoftMax, utilizes a time-based battle system somewhat similar to the Active Battle Time system of  Final Fantasy games. The characters have limited time required to perform an action in battle. They can also store up energy to unleash a stronger attack later. Using the technique named Carta, they can also perform various special attacks.
