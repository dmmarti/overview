 The insidious Dark Hand clan, lead by Valmont, a man possessed by a Chinese demon called Shendu, are planning to free imprisoned demons using a Pan Ku puzzle box.  When this box is solved in a specific area of the world, the demon is unleashed, free to wreak havoc once more.  It's up to Jackie Chan to travel the world and stop Valmont before he completes his goal.  Along the way, he will collect twelve mystical Talismans - one for each sign of the Chinese zodiac.  These Talismans grant Jackie special powers, including levitation, laser eyes, re-animation, transformation, and invisibility.  Jackie Chan Adventures is a cross between an Action RPG similar to The Legend of Zelda: The Ocarina of Time and a beat 'em up.  Players control Jackie, and can perform a variety of Kung Fu moves to defeat enemies.  They can also perform Jackie's trademark 'running up walls' technique to reach certain areas.  Other areas allow Jackie to interact with characters and play mini-games such as fishing, jump rope or drum playing.  The game also features an in-depth Collectable Card Game, similar to Yu-Gi-Oh!.
