 The events of this game occur shortly after the ones described in the first installment of the series. Once again, the player takes the role of Raidou Kuzunoha the 14th, the youngest in the long line of devil summoners. It is the Taishou period (the 1920-ies) in Japan, and once again the Capital City is threatened by supernatunal forces. Raidou works undercover at the Narumi Detective Agency, solving cases with mysterious backgrounds. It all begins when a young woman enters the office and asks the detective to find a missing man...  The game is part of the larger series dedicated to generations of devil summoners, which, in its turn, is a part of the meta-series Megaten. As in the first Raidou Kuzunoha game, the core gameplay is action-oriented. Raidou attacks enemies with swords or guns; but like before, he will need help from his demonic allies to defeat the foes. Raidou is able to summon two (as opposed to one in the first game) demons to help him in battles. The main gameplay difference is that instead of simply weakening enemies to capture them, as it was the case in the first game, now Raidou has to talk to hostile demons and persuade them to join his party, thus returning to the long-running Megaten tradition of demon negotiations as integral part of gameplay.
