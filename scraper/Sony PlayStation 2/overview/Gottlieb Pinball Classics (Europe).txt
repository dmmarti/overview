 Gottlieb Pinball Classics aims to bring eight classic tables from 50s to the 90s to the modern day by realizing them in full 3d with sounds just like the originals had. You'll be able to choose from tables like Ace High, Central Park, Big Shot, Genie, Black Hole, Victory, Tee'd Off and a secret unlockable table.  You'll also be able to unlock additional gameplay modes, artwork, interesting information and neat little distraction games like a love tester machine or a Xolten fortune teller machine.  The game also features realistic ball physics to attempt to duplicate the experience of the actual machines and six different views so you can get the view you want. When you finish going through the tables by yourself, you can invite three of your friends over to see who can get the highest score.  The Xbox version also lets you upload your best scores up to Xbox Live! to compete against the world.
