 All over Bubble Town, robots of all shapes and kinds are going out of control. Solex has infected them, causing them to go haywire and destroy the environment. Connor, Abby, and the rest of the Cubix gang must track down these rogue robots before the evil Dr. K and his gigantic robot Kolossal do. Now, by yourself or with a friend, you can join Cubix and the rest of the Bubble Town gang in a series of video games based on the Saturday morning TV show.
