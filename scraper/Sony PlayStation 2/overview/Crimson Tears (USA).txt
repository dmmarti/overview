 Crimson Tears is set in the near-future Tokyo, where an unknown entity has attacked and it's your job as a the main character to save the day. The game is a hack'n'slash affair in which three people enter the "dungeon" to kill monsters and loot the... loot.  Gameplay is very much like Nethack or Chocobo's Mysterious Dungeon as you delve deeper into the lair, leveling up, collecting stuff and occasionally returning to town and selling the excess. Very simple, yet very addicting.
