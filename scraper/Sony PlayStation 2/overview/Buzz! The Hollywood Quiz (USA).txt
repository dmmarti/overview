 Buzz! The Hollywood Quiz is the fifth game in the Buzz! series, and like the previous games in the series, it must be played using special USB 'buzzer' controllers instead of the regular controller. The game is sold both with and without these 'buzzers', and there are four buzzer controllers per set. This means that, using the PS2's two USB connections, up to eight players can play at once.  The game is set in a Hollywood awards event which contestants must answer questions on categories within the world of Hollywood (Movies, Film Stars, movie Gossip…) spread over eight different rounds, including the all new round  ‘Rollover’ where players answer questions individually, and if they get them wrong the points go into a jackpot until a question is answered correctly. The game features regular questions, as well as pictures and video clips.  There are several custom modes available, which allow you to create the perfect quiz by taking out the rounds you don't want to play. A single-player mode is also available.
