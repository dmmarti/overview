 Aces of War is a historical flight combat sim set in the Pacific Theater of World War II which presents a number of "what if?" scenarios based on famous battles and campaigns such as Bougainville, Wake Island, and Iwo Jima. While the game prominently features the infamous A6M Zero fighter plane, as well as other Japanese aircraft such as the Ki-43 Hayabusa and Ki-61 Hien, there are also many American planes available to fly, such as the P-40 Warhawk and F4F Wildcat for a total of 40 different aircraft from both sides of the conflict.  The game is on the realistic end of the simulation spectrum. Each of the 15 missions have numerous objectives, including attacking air or ground targets, bombing strategic targets, or protecting friendly units or bases from enemy attack. In addition to the mission mode, there is also a training mode and a versus mission mode for two players.
