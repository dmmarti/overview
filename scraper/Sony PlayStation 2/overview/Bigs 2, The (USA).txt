 The Bigs 2 is an arcade-oriented baseball game. During matches, the player takes the role of the active player, e.g. the batter, and tries to make a successful move. Successful actions fill up a power meter and when it is full, the player can unleash powerful abilities: Big Blast (an automatic home run when hitting the ball as batter) or Big Heat (a power pitch).  In contrast to the main console version, this version is more similar to the predecessor. The only change which has made its way into this version is the wheelhouse system which shows shows the high risk zones of each batter. Actually bringing a ball through these zones rewards a big hit to his overall effectiveness. The other additions like the Big Slam ability and new mini games are not present. The Become A Legend career mode is identical to the predecessor's Rookie Challenge.
