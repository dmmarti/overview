 The fourth game in the  Onechanbara, Zombie Hunters 2 is an upgraded version of    The Oneechanbara 2 much like  Zombie Hunters was an upgraded version of Zombie Zone. Zombie Hunters 2 continues the series's hack and slash style of gameplay in the vein of  Capcom's  Devil May Cry or Koei's  Dynasty Warriors games. This time,  Aya is joined by her sister,  Saki, and the mysterious  Reiko as they must find the cause of a second  Zombie outbreak. Retaining the "Cool Combo" system and the Rage and Blood meters found in the first game, The Oneechanbara 2 added some character specific moves, such as Aya's throwing knives, as well as smarter enemies, and new way's to defeat enemies.  It also introduced a  tag system to the series, allowing the player to select two characters and switch between them at anytime.    Alongside the story mode, the game also featured the arena style survival mode and the quest system. All these features were improved slightly, with all the story levels being different, the survival arena's being unique, and the quest being much more varied.
