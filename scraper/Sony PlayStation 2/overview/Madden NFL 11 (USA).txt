 Madden NFL 11 is another yearly update in the long-running Madden football series. The version for PlayStation 2 is based closely on the previous year's version, with roster updates, but reusing that version's modes, menus and gameplay options. The only major changes are new commentary by Gus Johnson and a new soundtrack.  Returning gameplay modes include Play Now, Family Play (with simplified controls), Superstar, Franchise, Fantasy Challenge, Skill Drills, and more. Online multiplayer however has been removed. All of last year's gameplay changes also return, including the Custom Control Stick and the "fight for the fumble" QTE mini-game.
