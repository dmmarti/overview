 Run Like Hell is a survival horror game.  You are Captain Nicholas Conner, a former pilot who works on a space station, involved in a project funded by the government.  You travel between planets on mundane assignments, only to return to your home station to find the place a complete wreck, courtesy of an evil alien race.  All crew members have been killed, violently, and it is up to you to stop the alien race, or run like hell.  RLH encompasses seven chapters, with multiple areas and missions per chapter.  You will be tasked with solving puzzles, killing aliens, and finding out just what the hell happened.  Enemies come in a variety of shapes and sizes, from small "grunt" type enemies to huge enemies that tower ten feet above you.  Each has it's own health and power, and each will provide a good challenge.  In a departure from previous survival horror games, there isn't much puzzle solving and not much slow times.  The entire game is a fast paced, frantic battle for survival, hence the title.  When spotted by an enemy, it will chase you until it's either killed or blocked... that's why you must "run like hell".  RLH features celebrity voice actors, such as Lance Henriksen (Frank Black from TV's "Millenium"), Michael Ironside (bad guy from Total Recall), Kate Mulgrew (Star Trek Voyager's Captain Janeway) and Brad Douriff, the voice of Chucky from the Child's Play movies.  You will use a variety of weapons to defeat the aliens, such as a shotgun, and more futuristic weapons, like a pulse blaster and nerve destroyer.
