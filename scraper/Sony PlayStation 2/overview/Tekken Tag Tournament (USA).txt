 In this, the fourth Tekken game in the series, and the first for the Playstation 2, you can duel it out with all your favourite characters from past Tekken games with the new tag feature (as the title suggests). You simply choose two characters to battle with, and during the fight you can swap the characters on screen (much like tag team wrestling).
