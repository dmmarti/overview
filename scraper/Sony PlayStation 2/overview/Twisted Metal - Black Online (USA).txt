 Twisted Metal: Black Online is essentially the same game as Twisted Metal: Black, except this version is for online play ONLY. There is NO storyline or single-player game.  The game features 15 vehicles from Twisted Metal: Black, such as Sweet Tooth, Axel, Shadow, and Mr. Grimm. It also features 20 levels from the original game.  The are 4 modes of online play: Deathmatch, Last Man Standing, Collector and Manhunt. In Deathmatch the best player wins. Last Man Standing is similar to Deathmatch but players do not respawn immediately, you have to wait until someone wins. In Collector, players have to collect items called 'artifacts'. The player at the end of the time limit with the most artifacts wins. Also, if you collect all the artifacts before time is up, you win. In Manhunt, one of the players becomes the prey and the others, the hunters.
