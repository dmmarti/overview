 The Bible Game is a Christian-themed party game. There are a variety of trivia questions (from a pool of 1,500) related to the Old Testament. The main two modes are "TV Game Show" and "Challenge Games". The latter lets you choose any mini-game. In the TV Game Show mode players need to buzz in quickly to answer. The game supports up to four players and includes 20 mini-games based on Biblical stories, from Jonah and the Whale to David and Goliath. It also includes music by Christian artists.
