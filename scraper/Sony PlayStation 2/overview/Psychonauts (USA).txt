 Adventure game legend Tim Schafer deviates from his traditional design formula with Psychonauts, a traditional console-style platformer with a very unorthodox style. At a summer camp for up-and-coming psychics, a young boy with a very unusual level of psychic ability inexplicably shows up. The boy, named Raz, is allowed to stay at the camp until his father comes to pick him up, but his arrival coincides with very strange circumstances.  Soon, evidence that someone is psychically tampering with the campers' minds reveals itself, and Raz is the only one who can stop it. As Raz, you must psychically project yourself into the psyches of several different people in order to figure out what is going on and who is behind it.  Each mind features a highly unique and stylized environment and varying gameplay, ranging from standard platform jumping to playing a Risk-like board game against Napoleon.
