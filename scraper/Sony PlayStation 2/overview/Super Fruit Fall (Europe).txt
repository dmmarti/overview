 Super Fruitfall is a simple tile matching game. The playing field is a frame which is differently shaped in every level, e.g. sometimes a regular square or a tube. The interior space also features different forms. Fruits are spread out in this frame which the player can rotate either left, right or 180Â°. Then of course the fruits start falling and if multiple of the same kind touch each other they vanish. The goal of a level is to get rid of every fruit.  There are 50 levels and four playing modes: arcade (solving as many levels as possible in a limited time), time challenge (solving one level with the fastest time), training (no clock) and a split-screen mode for two players.
