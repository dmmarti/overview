 Circus Maximus is a racing game that takes place in ancient Rome, and as such you'll be racing chariots around various tracks, including the famed Colliseum.  You'll be in control of both the driver and your partner, the warrior, whose job is to attack the other racers to make them fall over.  Chariots are controlled by whipping horses and trying to balance an on-screen meter that keeps your chariot balanced while taking turns fast.  There are four different race modes available; Training, which gives you the basics on how to play, Arcade, which is your standard race, Multiplayer, which lets you face off against three friends (or foes), and Career, which tracks your progress over a period of time.  There are seven different environments and 19 tracks, all set throughout the Roman Empire.  Each course is littered with obstacles, power ups, weapons, and special moves, designed to give you an edge in combat.
