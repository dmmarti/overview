 You have only one mission in this deadly game, and that's to be the only one left alive. You're hunting the terrorists across the world, and you have permission to kill, to kill all you like, as much as they're all bad guys. Use all kinda destructive weapons to survive and show no mercy to those mercenaries.  In this Gold Edition of Soldier of Fortune, you get the full retail version, 18 new multiplayer maps, 2 new game modes, and an exclusive interview of John Mullins
