 This game, based on the famous Quentin Tarantino movie Reservoir Dogs, fills in the gaps in the movie that are only briefly mentioned (like the robbery at the jewelry store). Throughout the story you get to play all seven main characters, from Mr. Blonde to Mr. White.   The missions are introduced by game engine cutscenes, which often recreate moments from the film. For example, in the first mission you see Mr. Pink holding his famous monologue "I don't think we got set up, I know we got set up!" and then you play Mr. Blue as the police arrives at the jewelry where your goal is to get out alive.  To do so, you have two choices: be a psychopath and shoot your way out, or try the subtle approach without harming anyone. For instance, if you do not want to harm anyone you can take a hostage and then threaten the police to lay their weapons down and order them to face the wall. There are a few missions in which you must drive a car but mostly you walk through them. Like in the Hitman series, the game shows at the end of every mission how well you have done.
