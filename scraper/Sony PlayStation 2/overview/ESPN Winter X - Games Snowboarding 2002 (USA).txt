 This is the sequel to the previous year's incarnation, ESPN Winter X-Games Snowboarding. This one features 13 professional snowboarders along with 20 authentic tracks sponsored by the Winter X Games.  Not only can players compete in authentic events, they can also garner sponsors in order to buy better equipment and can make their own video highlights and show off to friends as well.  Players can pull of combos with the "linking system", producing wild stunts and gaining higher scores.
