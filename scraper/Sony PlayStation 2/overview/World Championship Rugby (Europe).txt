 WCR: World Championship Rugby is an action-oriented translation of the rugby sport. The player uses the gamepad or the keyboard to simulate various motion sequences, e.g. passing or kicking. Playing modes are single matches or a world cup championship using one of the 20 teams which participated in the 2003 World Cup.   The game also features most of the official rugby rules, the original names for the teams of England and Wales and commentary by Miles Harrison and Stuart Barnes.
