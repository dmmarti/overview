 The Simpsons Game is an action platformer based on the long-running cartoon. The Simpson family finds themselves trapped in a video game and must fight their way out using their newly found powers.  Homer can expand into a rolling blob, Bart can become Bartman (with grappling hook), Lisa can use her saxophone to stun enemies, and Marge can gather mobs with her megaphone. Each character has a power meter that limits the use of the special abilities, which is recharged by defeating enemies. They also have powers that can only be used at specific trigger points, such as Bart catching updrafts with his cape, Homer inflating himself with helium, Lisa summoning the hand of Buddha to move objects, and Marge sending Maggie into crawlspaces. The abilities are upgraded throughout the game. Each character also has an item they can pick up which will make them temporarily invulnerable, and give them unlimited special attacks for this period.  The game is divided into a series of sixteen "episodes", each a parody of a popular game or genre; these episodes have names like Medal of Homer or Neverquest. Each level features two or more of the Simpson clan. Players must switch back and forth using each family members' unique powers to complete each level. Alternatively, most platforms also allow two-player cooperative play.
