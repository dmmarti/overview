 Ico is a boy with horns.  At the age of twelve when his horns grew large enough the elders send him away to be sacrificed to prevent evil spirits from attacking the village. Entombed in a crumbling ancient castle Ico only manages to begin his escape when a freak earthquake shakes loose the vessel he has been locked in.  Ico shortly meets a Princess named Yorda who has also been imprisoned by the evil Queen. Ico must negotiate the puzzles of the ruined castle and escort the Princess to safety. She, as well as Ico, cannot climb or jump, so Ico has to clear or create a path where there is none. Yorda is the only one capable of opening the many magical doors necessary to escape. Ico needs her as much as she needs him, so he must protect her from the many evil spirits that will try to take her away.  Shown through a third-person perspective, mixing action-based exploration gameplay with puzzles, the game has no HUD. Other striking features are the soft lightning visual style, later adapted by many other games, low-key use of in-game music, and conversations through a fictional language, leaving much to the player's imagination. The game takes place in the same universe as Shadow of the Colossus (2005), to which it is a sequel.
