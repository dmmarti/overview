 The player is cast in a role of James Sunderland, on first sight a normal person who got confused as anyone else would as he received a letter from his wife asking him to come to Silent Hill, to their special place. The only problem is that his wife died three years ago, and has kept the secrets surrounding her death. James decides to honor the letter's request, wondering if this is a sick joke or if there is more to this. As James reaches the outskirt of Silent Hill, he finds that the road is blocked, and parks at an abandoned restroom. Little does he realize that this is the first step forward into the mystery of Silent Hill.  This is the original Silent Hill 2 game with no extras of any kind, and released for PlayStation 2 exclusively. A version with new weapons, new characters to play with, and new "Born from a Wish" scenario was released as Silent Hill 2: Restless Dreams. These features made it to North America for the Playstation 2 in the form of the game's Greatest Hits release.  Unlike the North-American release, the PAL and Japanese releases have an extra "Making of Silent Hill 2" disc featuring lots of behind-the-scenes material, interview with developers, Konami game trailers and more.
