 EA Sports delivers their entry into the US Major League baseball game genre with Triple Play 2002.  This game features 3D graphics, various modes of play, and guest commentary sound (see details below).    Triple Play 2002 is the latest installment in the Triple Play series of baseball games produced by Electronic Arts.  It follows Triple Play 2001 as part of the continuing Triple Play series of games.  Triple Play 2002 expands on its predecessors with updated player graphics, including 3D face scans of some major league players, and updated major league ballpark graphics.  Gameplay modes include single game, season, and home run derby (but no franchise mode).  Triple Play 2002 features voice commentary from familiar sports personalities Bob Costas and Harold Reynolds.  Triple Play 2002, like its predecessors, also includes the ability to customize your game by creating your own teams and players to use along side the 2001/2002 Major League rosters.
