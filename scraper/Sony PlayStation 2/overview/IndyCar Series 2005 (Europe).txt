 Following in the footsteps of the previous game, IndyCar Series 2005 once again puts players inside the world of high-speed racing.  Choose Quick Race to get straight onto the speedway, IndyCar Series to race the entire Indy circuit, or Indy 500 to experience the thrills of the Indianapolis 500 from qualifying to race day.  The game includes 4 skill levels (Easy, Normal, Pro and Custom), 15 race tracks, a long list of famous professional drivers to choose from, garage tweaking and tuning, driver profile customization, and the "Masterclass Course" tutorial. The "Trading Card Album" contains the unlockables attained by accomplishing certain feats in the game, such as finishing a race in its entirety. The unlockable content includes the ability to create a custom driver, car accessories, car skins and more.  In any single player game it is possible for as many as 33 competitors to be onscreen at one time. Friends can play against each other offline in split screen. Multiplayer can be by direct system link or over the internet.
