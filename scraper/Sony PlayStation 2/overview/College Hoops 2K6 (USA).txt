 College Hoops 2K6 is a game dealing with college basketball. Go through Legacy Mode as the coach to bring a small college respect and eventually win a championship. Go online to test your skills against players around the world. Also included are features such as Pre-season, the Coach's Clipboard, Midnight Madness (which allows you to participate in the first practice of the year with a midnight intra-squad exhibition that has become a college hoops tradition.), Strip 'n' Rip System, Shot Stick (which controls the way you take your shot to make a basket), and V.I.P. System. Another feature is Selection Sunday broadcast shows, where you'll watch a broadcast of your teamâ€™s placement into the NCAA Tournament and listen to commentary as video clips give you the low down on all the bracket match ups.
