 Pool:shark 2 is a simulation of the pool sport. Its most unique aspect is its setting: instead of high class tournaments, the player find himself in smoky pubs with opponents like truck-drivers and lightly clad biker women. The handling, however, is similar to other pool games. The player has a lot of opportunities to tweak the position of the cue. A analog stick or mouse movement simulates the shot.  The game features ten pool variants, including popular ones like Eight-Ball and trick shots or exotic ones like snowboat pool. When playing the career mode (called "Hustler"), the player can bet money. The winnings are reinvested in clothes or pieces of equipment which look different but have no bearings on gameplay. Every successful match unlocks the next of overall 20 opponents.
