 Splashdown: Rides Gone Wild is the sequel to the original Splashdown released for the PlayStation 2 and Xbox. While still maintaining its racing focus, it differentiates itself from the original by offering levels designed around theme parks, whereas the original featured standard water racing tracks. The thrill ride tracks are dynamic in the game, and progressively change with each lap as the characters drive through them making it much less mechanical and more varied.  The game still features many of the original modes with a more standard set of tracks, such as the career mode which allows you to earn points which can lead to unlockables, such as additional characters or vehicles  in the game. Also included are Training, Arcade and Versus modes.
