 From the makers of the amazing Motocross Madness series, comes a brand new motocross game...  MX Unleashed brings in loads of great new features, whilst still managing to keep the things that its predecessors good.    It has lots of enhancements like a top of the range physics engine, letting you see all the movements of the bike realistically flow through the rider, and bone-jarring crashed looking very realistic and painful.  It also has over 40 courses, made up of freestyle, motocross and national tracks, a whole new career mode incredible sound, and the opportunity to play again your friends with split screen mode, and the addition of a much needed new trick engine, allowing combos and no handed landings.
