 The player takes control of Lei Yun, an extremely gifted warrior apprentice, against a dark race of powerful demons, called Gyakki.  Combat is defined by two aspects: the first one is given by the three main swords of the game, each having his own special abilities when equipped, adding the strategic element of using the correct weapon according to the type of demon you are facing. In addition, the player can also use the weapons dropped by slain enemies. Second aspect is aerial combat, called "sword time" that leads to extremely powerful, and acrobatic, combos.
