 CID The Dummy is a platformer featuring, as the title bespeaks, a crash dummy as the protagonist. Cid was endowed special powers by its inventor, professor Werken, and finds itself charged with the task of saving the daughter of his. Action is represented in 3D while the gameplay is bidimensional in reality, à la Super Mario Galaxy. Levels present to Cid both enemies and puzzles — or, more exactly, obstacles of intellectual nature — like eluding the sights of security cams or pressing a requested button. A basic attack, plus around ten special moves, is how Cid can strike foes it comes into: each special attack is related with a gesture to be performed with the Wii Remote, with tutorials available to make the player familiarize themselves with.
