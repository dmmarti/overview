 The 2005 update to the All-Star Baseball series includes online features such as head-to-head play and improved online updates to the rosters (both Xbox and PS2). You can now also bat using the analog controller and two new camera angles have been added: the fieldercam and the broadcastcam.  As for the gameplay, the create-a-player mode has been enhanced, and a franchise mode has been added. Steve Lyons and Thom Brennaman are the commentators, with Spanish play-by-play by Arizona Diamondbacks' commentator Oscar Soria. The game also includes a full gameplay tutorial for those new to the game.  There is special attention to the 2003 MLB season, as you can replay historic moments in the This Week In Baseball challenge. With an official license, there are about 80 stadiums, authentic uniforms, and a hall of fame that honours MLB legends. Next to the 30 official Major League teams, there are some historic bonus teams such as a wartime and a postwar stars team, and various fantasy teams.
