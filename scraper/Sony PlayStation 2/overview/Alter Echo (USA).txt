 A third person action adventure game with a focus on close quarters combat.   The "high concept" here is the setting of a living bio-organic planet that provides a stunning backdrop to this otherwise fairly conventional action romp.   The player has the option of morphing between three forms that specialise in either hand to hand combat, ranged gunplay, or stealth play.
