 Prince Pixel is in a pickle. His parents have been kidnapped by an evil demon, called...Demon! Pixel has to rely on the power of Graffiti and his pet dog Pastel to release his parents from peril. The story follows Pixel around 22 levels in which he does various tasks with the help of creatures made with his magic wand which has magical powers.  The gameplay is your basic action RPG with battling the monsters, jumping some platforms and gaining stuff which helps you advance through the game.  The power of Graffiti enables the Prince to animate anything. Anything at all. With Graffiti, the player can make their own monsters which are theirs to control. For example, player can make a monster with huge feet, and that monster can jump high, or if one makes a monster with huge arms (with spikes in them), that monster will probably pack quite a punch.   Monster construction is very free, and that means the player can draw anything, and "make them alive". Players can draw different parts of the monster, attach them to each other as they please, add a few accessories, paint the parts and define, which part is a hand, leg or an attacking device. Only the player's imagination is the limit.
