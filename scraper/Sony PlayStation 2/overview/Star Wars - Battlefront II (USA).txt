 A second helping of Battlefront provides all the same multiplayer action with an added level of spice, and plenty of new content.  Along with an updated assortment of multiplayer maps based upon the Star Wars Saga, including Episode III: Revenge of the Sith, you now have the opportunity to fight as some of the greatest heroes, including the Skywalker family, Darth Vader, Yoda, The Emperor himself and Princess Leia, among others. An expanded single player campaign has you fighting as Vader's 501st Legion of troops, fighting in the Clone Wars as the undercurrent of evil, soon to be known as the Empire, takes its place in the Galaxy.  Now you can also take to the stars in specially developed multiplayer levels where your skill in an X-Wing or TIE-Fighter come to the fore. Defeat enemy ships and destroy the heavy cruisers and capital ships to achieve victory, or land within enemy territory and blow up a Star Destroyer from the inside.
