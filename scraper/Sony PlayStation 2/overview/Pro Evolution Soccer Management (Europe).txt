 Pro Evolution Soccer Management invites users to experience the dizzying highs and dreadful lows of managing a top-flight club. Players can manage any club from six European leagues, and are charged with balancing the day-to-day running of their chosen side, including player selection, training methods, and transfer dealings.  Using a simple yet effective menu system, players oversee every aspect of their team's performance. In addition, coaching staff must be chosen to assist in specific areas, while Pro Evolution Soccer 5's exhaustive player database can be scoured for new signings before entering negotiations to secure their services. Data from Pro Evolution Soccer 5 can be used in Management for the creation of 'Dream Teams', which can then be swapped and used in both games.  Pro Evolution Soccer Management is the perfect complement to Pro Evolution Soccer 5 and features an incredible level of depth. As in the real thing, the user will stand or fall by the results of their team, and while European glory is the aim of every manager, each team's Board of Directors will be quick to give struggling managers the sack.
