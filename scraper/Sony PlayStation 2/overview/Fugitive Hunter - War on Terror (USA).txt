 Fugitive Hunter: War on Terror is a first-person shooter starring a bounty hunter named Jake Seaver, whose mission is to track and apprehend some of the world's most notorious criminals.   Developer Black Ops Entertainment drew many of its ideas from the FBI's Most Wanted List to create a game that attempts to mirror the realistic pursuits and criminal behavior associated with nationwide manhunts. The game includes a cinematic story line and motion-captured animation, as well as a variety of weapons that can be modified by players throughout the game.
