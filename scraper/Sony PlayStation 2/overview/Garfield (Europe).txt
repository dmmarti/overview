 Play as the fat cat himself in this interactive puzzle, adventure game. The game takes place entirely inside Garfield's house which is presented in full 3-D.  Jon has left Garfield and Odie, the dog, alone in the house for the day.  The day has been uneventful until Garfield is rudely awakened from his afternoon nap by a loud noise. He finds that Odie has made a real mess of the house ... and Jon is due home in an hour!  It's particularly difficult for cats and dogs to use cleaning equipment and supplies...but you'll find a way to use a vacuum cleaner and other objects.  You'll get a big plate of lasagna as a reward if you get it all done before Jon walks in.  The game is controlled with the keyboard and mouse. Puzzles come in the form of "mini games." You'll be finding and using inventory objects as part of their solutions.
