 Junkyard, the town of endless rain... a grim world, where only the fittest can survive. People are divided into tribes that constantly fight each other in order to become the strongest in Junkyard. For only the strongest, the champion of Junkyard, can set on a journey to find Nirvana - a legendary land that is just the opposite of the sinister Junkyard. Serph is a fighter of a tribe called Embryon. Like all the others, he also wants to become the champion and to reach Nirvana. One day a mysterious object called "The Pod" appears. Serph and his friends are affected by its lights, and a result they find out they have gained supernatural, demonic powers. This is when Serph's quest truly begins.  "Digital Devil Saga" is a part of  Megaten game universe, related to  Shin Megami Tensei and  Persona. Unlike all other Megaten games, you can't communicate with random enemies (demons) by talking to them, and also can't summon them in battles. Instead, Serph and his party are able to turn into demons themselves. During the round-based combat, the characters can fight as demons or as humans (using guns). The most important combat element is the ability to devour defeated foes. Each devoured enemy adds to your karma points, which can later be assigned to learn various skills.
