 In Stuntman, you play as an aspiring stunt car driver, working on major motion pictures.  You begin your trek as a Rookie, working on low-budget films.  As you gain notoriety, you will get offers from big budget, Hollywood films, complete with large stunts and pyrotechnics.  Stuntman takes place in six different locations, each location shooting a different movie.  There are four to eight different missions for each movie.  Some will have you chasing a car around a harbor, to jumping between two trains, to jumping through windows.  When a movie is complete, you can view a trailer of the movie, with your stunts worked into it.  Aside from the Career mode, you can choose to play various driving tests, such as Speed Tests, Precision Tests, and, of course, Stunt Tests.  Stuntman also includes a stunt park editor, where you can place ramps, obstacles, and other equipment in an arena, and then choose to play it.  As a Stuntman, you get to drive a variety of cars, such as police cars, sports cars, trucks, and armored vehicles.  Stuntman can be informative, as well.  Before each stunt, your character will describe what he has to do, and how important timing is.  You can learn various techniques that real stunt drivers use, such as the cannon roll and the nitro boost.  You can also learn what the different pieces of equipment are called, such as the "side pipe", which is used to roll a car onto it's side.
