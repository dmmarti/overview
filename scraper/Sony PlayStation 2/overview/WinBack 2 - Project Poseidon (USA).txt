 A third-person action game which centers around the exploits of a crisis response team. The three player characters, Craig Contrell, Nick Bruno, and Mia Cabrera, must shoot their way through 30 missions of hostage rescuing, drug cartel smashing, and world saving in a wide variety of offices, warehouses, mansions, and laboratories.  The most unique aspect of the game is its "Route" system. Each mission has two different characters, and is played through from both perspectives. During the first part each mission, a number of "Assist" points will happen where the player must assist the second character -- their performance here affects the playthrough of the second part of the mission, and doing well will reward you with cover fire or health bonuses later.  There is also a multiplayer mode for up to four players, featuring several game mode including deathmatch and sniper battles. Bots are available if you have fewer than four players.
