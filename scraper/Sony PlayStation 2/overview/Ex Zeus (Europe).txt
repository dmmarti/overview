 In 2102 C.E., a giant asteroid enters Earth's orbit, only to be revealed too late that inside are a horde of aliens lead by the entity "Diadora" that unleashes an invasion on mankind! Hiding deep underground, the surviving rebellions create three experimental robots; Sophia, Calista and Dynamis, to combat Diadora's army, the objective codenamed "Operation ExZeus". These three robots are humanity's last hope!  The game is a port of an arcade game that was released in 2003 on the Sega NAOMI in the Japanese arcades and on the Tsunami Tsumo in the US ones.  The game is an on-rails arcade shooter in a third-person perspective. You can move in all directions while progressing forward, shooting enemies and collecting power-ups and gold (which act as money you can use to buy items at a shop every time you beat a boss). You have the ability to lock-on enemies and fire powerful missiles at them, and you also have a laser (which recharges by itself after every use) you can launch by holding down the fire button. You can also send out nuclear bombs on the area which can clear all the enemies on-screen, and can also help in bosses.  At the end of every level, you face a boss. Before a boss begins, a screen will show up telling you the weak-points of said boss. Successfully defeating a boss will take you to the item shop, where you can buy items to power up your robot, and then you will proceed to the next level.
