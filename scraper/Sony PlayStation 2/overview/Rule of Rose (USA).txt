 Jennifer is a young girl who has recently been transferred to an orphanage somewhere in England in the 1930s. The game revolves around the young girl's imagination and attempts to get accepted by a social group of other children at the orphanage. Jennifer is unusually weak and will have trouble in any fighting so the game is more about avoiding enemies than fighting them when possible. At one point in the game you come across a dog who is essential for the finding of items and progression through the game.  Players must guide Jennifer and her faithful companion Brown the dog through the game while avoiding monsters and other unpleasantries to find precious items for the Aristocracy of the Red Canyon.
