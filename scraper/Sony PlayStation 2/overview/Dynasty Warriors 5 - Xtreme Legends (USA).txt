 A kind of expansion to Dynasty Warriors 5, Xtreme Legends allows the player to do a lot more with the Romance of the Three Kingdoms generals. Standard battles and co-op are still present, plus a new character creation feature and 'destiny' mode which sees you follow a soldier from grunt to officer.  Xtreme Legends can be played by itself or it can be used with an existing Dynasty Warriors 5 save file in order to unlock new content such as battlefields and dozens of characters based on the novels.  In most respects the game sticks to the tried and tested Dynasty Warriors formula, and the core gameplay boils down to charging one general into the ranks of the enemy and coming out unscathed, all underscored by cheesy rock guitars.
