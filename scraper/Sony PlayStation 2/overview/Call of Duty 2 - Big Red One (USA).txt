 In the second Call of Duty game for consoles, players again take to battle in The Second World War.  As with other Call of Duty games, focus is on the characters and their drama amidst the furious, heavily scripted, first-person action.  As a private new to war in America's most legendary infantry division, nicknamed the Big Red One for the distinctive patch they wore, players will fight through the game as a team in the Fighting First, and will be affected by the loss of friends on the battlefield.  Players will have to re-enact the successes of World War II through a wide variety of land, sea and air missions in Africa, Sicily and Normandy, by using vehicles including tanks, jeeps, armored cars and half-tracks.  Success will depend on how well players can move, shoot and complete the objectives that a commanding officer provides before each mission.  The Xbox and PS2 versions offer multiplayer games with up to 16 players.
