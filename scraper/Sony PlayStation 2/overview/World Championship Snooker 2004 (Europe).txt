 This edition of Codemasters official licensed Snooker game includes over 30 snooker-champions and 10 official snooker tournaments.  The LG Tour is the campaign of the game in which you can make your own player and play against the best of the world to win the championship. To make it easy for beginners and as realistic as possible for those who want it, you can change how much help the program gives you while you play (i.e. a aim-meter).  But the developers also included a big tutorial which teaches you everything from the rules to the right angle for a shot. It's even possible to make a free game where you get feedback for every shot you make.  Besides the campaign you can also play 8-Ball and US-9-Ball Pool, the famous trick-snooker, 5 bonus game-modes (i.e. Against the clock - play a frame with the clock ticking and only a limited amount of time for each shot) and the Classic Match mode.  The Classic Match mode is the most interesting because you can play famous games from the whole history of Snooker like the really big championship final from 1985 Steve Davis vs. Dennis Taylor which had 18,5 million viewers in Great Britain alone.  And if you get bored with the challenging AI, you can also play over LAN or online against up to 16 players. If you're good enough your name will even appear in the hall of fame on the official website.
