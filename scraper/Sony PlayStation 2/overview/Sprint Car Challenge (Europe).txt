 In Sprint Car Challenge, you drive light weight cars around short dirt tracks in three game modes: test drive, race and challenge. In test drive you can practice with each available car and track in the game, without any limits of how long you can play. In race mode you will race against seven other drivers. The challenge mode works like race mode, but the player in last place for each lap is eliminated and it ends when just one player remains.  At the start of the game you will only have a sprint car, but as you perform well in races, you'll unlock two other cars, the sand rail and the 4x4 rallycat, as well as new tracks. Some actions during races, like crashing or skidding, will give extra points.
