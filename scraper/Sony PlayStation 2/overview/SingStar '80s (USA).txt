 SingStar 80's is a karaoke game, featuring classic hits from the eighties.  The main focus of the game is singing those songs as good as one can. The game gives points which are distributed by the purity of singing, as in how well does one manage to stay on tune. It doesn't matter if you change octaves in the middle of the song or what words are you singing in (it doesn't have a word recognition), so your singing is rated by how well you manage to hit the correct note at the correct time.  Here is the US tracklist: •A Flock of Seagulls - I Ran (So Far Away) •Billy Joel - Uptown Girl •Billy Ocean - Caribbean Queen (No More Love On The Run) •Blondie - Heart of Glass •Culture Club - Do You Really Want To Hurt Me? •Cyndi Lauper - Time After Time •Dead or Alive - You Spin Me Round •Dexy's Midnight Runners - Come On Eileen •Duran Duran - Rio •Erasure - A Little Respect •Europe - The Final Countdown •Foreigner - I Want To Know What Love Is •Kim Wilde - Kids In America •Madness - Our House •Madonna - Material Girl •Men at Work - Who Can It Be Now •Nena - 99 Red Balloons •R.E.M. - Stand •Run DMC - It's Tricky •Simple Minds - Don't You (Forget About Me) •Soft Cell - Tainted Love •Squeeze - Tempted •Starship - We Built This City •Survivor - Eye Of The Tiger •Tears For Fears - Everybody Wants To Rule The World •The Pretenders - Brass In Pocket •Thompson Twins - Hold Me Now •Tina Turner - Simply The Best •Twisted Sister - We're Not Going To Take It •Wham! - Wake Me Up Before You Go Go
