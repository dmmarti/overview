 SingStar Bollywood is a karaoke game, with a tracklist containing Bollywood hits. Bollywood is the popular name for the Mumbai-based Hindi-language film industry.  The game gives points which are distributed by the purity of singing, as in how well does one manage to stay on tune. It doesn't matter if you change octaves in the middle of the song or what words are you singing in (it doesn't have a word recognition), so your singing is rated by how well you manage to hit the correct note at the correct time.  Here is the tracklist:  1. Aashiqui - "Nazar Ke Samne" 2. Aksar - "Jhalak Dikhla Ja" 3. Chalte Chalte - "Chalte Chalte" 4. Chalte Chalte - "Suno Na Suno Na" 5. Chameli - "Sajna Ve Sajna" 6.
