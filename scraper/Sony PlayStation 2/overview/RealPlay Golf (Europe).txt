 REALPLAY Golf is a golf game with all of the usual types of mode (Stroke Play, Tournaments, Practice, Multiplayer, Stableford, etc.) featured. The real difference between this and the multitude of Golf games available for PlayStation 2 is that it does not support the DualShock Controller at all - it uses its own wireless motion-sensing Golf Club. Players are required to use the wireless club to take their shots using realistic golf swings.  There is a Driving Range and a Putting Course to practice on before setting out on a full round of Golf. The game is set amongst 8 courses, featuring environments from the U.K, USA, France, New Zealand, Scotland and the Caribbean. There is a range of A.I. players to compete against, each with their own personality and play style. These can be unlocked as reward for winning tournaments, achieving given feats or reducing your handicap.
