 In Stunt GP, you control one of 16 different remote-controlled cars. The cars are divided in three categories: Wild-Wheels, Speed Demons and Aeroblaster, each with it's unique driving feel. The cars can be tuned up with many different tuning parts, like better batteries, tires, suspension etc. - a total of 1000 different combinations.  You race on 24 original, colorful tracks with tons of bridges, ramps and loopings. You can perform absolutely breathtaking stunts on these tracks, but you need to be careful about the battery - if the car runs out of power, the race is probably over very soon.  Of course, it's possible to play multiplayer. No network support is included, so multiplayer gaming stages on one PC in split screen mode.
