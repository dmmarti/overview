 By 2078, earth's natural resources have been depleted. Massive CO2 emissions have occurred and there are no longer fossil fuel reserves. Because of global warming, the rise of the ocean level has made many countries disappear. Fortunately, extreme weather patterns have emerged and wind has become an endless resource with enormous speeds. Mankind has adapted and now uses the powerful wind as a source for transportation, constructing vehicles to make use of it. Additionally, The International Racing League is organized, a racing event where speed is determined by the control of wind. This is where you come in.  Cyclone Circus is a racer where you can compete against 9 computer players or against another player in dual screen mode. The cars sport an exotic and futuristic design, and each car has a plasma sail that you have to use as good as you can. Turning the wind to your advantage, you can pick up numerous bonuses and even power-ups that will catapult you ahead of your opponents. Each level has a very specific setting and atmosphere, and contains a number of special jump sites and bonus areas where you can do special tricks to score more points.  There are ten characters, nine courses with shortcuts, and eight trick levels based on ramps and fly routes.
