 College Hoops 2K7 is the update of College Hoops 2K6 and a continuation of 2K's NCAA basketball franchise.  It features the obligatory roster updates (including the names of the players) with 325 NCAA Division I teams to choose from and improve crowd reactions, updated mascots, new fight songs and real life coaches such as Billy Donovan, Roy Williams and Jay Wright.  It has the standard modes and has an updated Legacy (franchise) mode that has the player take command of a NCAA team, recruiting and training potential NBA players for the future.  It sports updated offensive and defensive A.I. and features Team Unity where the chemistry of the team combined with the captain's leadership qualities can combine to help their team in their performance and morale on the court.  Players can also customize by creating their own school along with uniforms and even design a unique stadium for their created school.  The games are almost identical except for a few differences: the PS3 and Xbox 360 versions has the ability to create their own chants for their crowds to yell during home games and the PS3 utilizes the SIXAXIS controller to shoot free throws by tilting it.
