 Energy Airforce is a realistic flight simulator where the player can pilot many real-life military aircraft such as the F/A-22 Raptor, F-16 Fighting Falcon, and X-35 JSF. It takes a similar approach as racing simulator Gran Turismo, requiring the player to train and pass license tests before more advanced missions and aircraft are unlocked, as only the F-16 is unlocked at the start. However, there are also free Dogfight and Arcade modes where an impatient player can jump straight in.
