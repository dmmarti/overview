 NASCAR Thunder 2003 simulates the NASCAR driver experience.  Dozens of locations are available, each with several alternate tracks.  All the big-name drivers of the present, and a few of the past, are available to choose from, or you can create your own driver and car.  Simulate a season, or even a full 20-year career complete with sponsorship deals and car improvements along the way.  Moments of the Race places you in real-life racing situations, asking you to either duplicate reality's outcome, or improve upon it.  Or you can race against up to three people.  The choice is yours.
