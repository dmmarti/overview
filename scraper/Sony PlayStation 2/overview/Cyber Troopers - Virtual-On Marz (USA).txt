 The world is just a business, especially when it comes to making money out of entertainment. For many, the creation of the Virtuaroids (VR) began a new age as the 49-foot mechanical giants gained the attention of everyone and anyone nearby. Noticing this, business makers used the opportunity to create a new form of entertainment upon the surface of Mars. Known as Limited War, the performances drew crowds the universe over. It wasn't until corporate greed appeared once more that things began to fall out of control. Those in power began to fight each other for a stake in the new events, leading to internal fighting and crime. A special investigations unit was formed, in hopes it would eliminate such crime and bring order back. They are known as 'MARZ', and as a member of that team you must use your new found position to your advantage. In each mission, you will control your own VR and must defend or attack a number of key locations and other VR units. Over time you will gain new additions to the machines armour and weapons which will aid you in later missions. You'll also unlock bigger and more powerful VR's as well.
