 Someone has stolen an artifact from the British Museum - a sacred (and CURSED) Egyptian statuette called the "Eye of Isis". You are called in to investigate its disappearance, find and return it to the pyramid where it once resided. The deadly curse must be stopped, and time is of the essence!  In this "adrenaline pumping" horror action/adventure, choose to play either Dr. Darien Dane or his assistant, Victoria Sutton. Each character has different scenarios to complete to reach the same objective. Travel to seven different locations, battling undead monsters (zombies, mummies, etc. and their bosses) as well as animated deadly objects. Locate and use a variety of weapons including a shotgun, rifle, pistol, truncheon, crossbow, flame-thrower and mortar gun. Find clues, characters and puzzles to help you discover the location of the sacred statue.  During the game, realtime 3D cut scenes, interactions with NPCs as well as visual and audio messages provide more information to advance the story line. Gameplay is in 3rd person with action scenes reverting to 1st person.
