 The Backyard Sports series let you play games with a group of virtual kids, some of whom happen to be young versions of professional athletes. Backyard Basketball brings the NBA and WNBA into your house with kid versions of league stars.  Players create a junior avatar of themselves, draft a team, pick their favorite pro uniforms, and hit the court in exhibition games or try to manage their team through a full season. Either way, the emphasis is on fun and accessibility for all ages.
