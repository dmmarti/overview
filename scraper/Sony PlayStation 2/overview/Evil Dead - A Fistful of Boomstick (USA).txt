 Ash returns for another round of killing, slashing and destroying the undead.  On this occasion, with a brand new story based on the world created in the Evil Dead films, Ash can teleport to 4 distinct eras of Dearborn, to not only see how the invasion of the dead took place all those years ago, but to watch in horror as they multiply and control the world they now live in.  As Ash, you must use his chainsaw for a hand, as well as the trusty shotgun and pistol, new magic abilities (call down a rain of fire or possess the enemy to do the dirty work for you), plus a host of other weapons (grenades, shovels, etc.) to destroy the dead.  Once you complete a level in story mode, you can go back into that level in arcade mode and attempt to complete a range of challenges (for example, taking down a certain amount of evil in a set amount of time).
