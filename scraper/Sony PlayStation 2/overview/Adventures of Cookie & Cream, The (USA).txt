 Cookie and Cream are two cartoon bunnies who are on their way home on the night before their clan's yearly moon festival only to find out that the moon has decided to run away, and if Cookie and Cream aren't able to find it, there will never be another festival. Fearing this, the duo sets out to make sure that it doesn't come true.  The Adventures of Cookie and Cream is designed for cooperative gameplay with two players. The goal of each level is to get to the end in a limited amount of time.  There is basically a straight road from A to B where the players have to overcome obstacles in their way. This includes standard platforming or puzzles which need both players to solve, e.g. one has to press a button so that the other can progress. Because the way is not the same for both characters the game uses a split-screen view. Power-ups increase the time limits but certain obstacles decrease it again if touched. There are overall 35 levels.  It is possible to play the game alone but then the player has to control both characters at once. The game also features a unique 4-player mode where each character is controlled by two people and one joypad.
