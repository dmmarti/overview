 FIFA 2001 comes back to the series' fast-paced roots. The gameplay is balanced differently to previous versions, and includes online play as an option.   It includes 17 leagues from around the world in addition to over 50 national teams. Exhibition, Tournament, League, Cup, Season, and Training modes are available to play, ranging from simple round-robin competition to simple knock-outs to combinations of the two, and the player rosters are as up-to-date as possible.
