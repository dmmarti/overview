 Get your clubs and play some Frolf!  What's Frolf?  It's golf played with frogs instead of balls.  And in the twisted world of Ribbit King, it's not just about winning the Frolf Cup and Super Ribbinite prize, it's about saving your planet, Hippitron.  Ribbit King stretches the twenty course Frolf tournament over five unique worlds with a wide cast of characters.  Every planet has its own unique obstacles including dangerous plants and animals poised to pounce on your frog.  Adding a random factor, your frog has a mind of his own.  Power-ups allow frogs to fly farther, swim faster, and modify your frog's behavior in the wild.  Ribbit King has a story mode and versus mode and supports up to four players.
