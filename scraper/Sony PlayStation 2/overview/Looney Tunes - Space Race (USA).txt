 The classic characters of Looney Tunes come to life in Space Race. There are 9 legendary characters to choose from; including Bugs Bunny, Daffy Duck, Taz, Sylvester, Yosemite Sam, and more.  Riding high-powered ACME rockets, players will have to guide their chosen rider through 12 unique tracks from throughout the Looney Tunes universe, each with their own short-cuts, jumps and traps, in a frantic race for the finish line. Along the way, the player will pick up many wacky distractions to slow down their opponents, including the portable hole, spring-loaded boxing gloves, falling elephants, and more. One can even step the insanity up a notch, in some 4 player, split-screen action. That's all, folks!
