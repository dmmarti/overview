 Things begin with the main character moving to a small town from the city. Shortly after starting school, you begin to hear rumors of a TV program that tells who your soul mate is. It is revealed later that everyone that appears on the program ends up kidnapped, and later, dead. The main character discovers that he has the ability to go inside of TVs and save the people who appear on the TV. The main storyline follows this mystery of the kidnappings.     The fourth installment of Persona has many similarities to Persona 3. You can build social links for different characters, which are represented by tarot cards. Raising the rank of these social links increases the potency of the "personae" associated with them. Personae are "shadows" of people which are used in battle to unleash special powers. All battles are fought in a variety of dungeons inside of the TV. Each person kidnapped creates a new dungeon particular to them. You also have to balance your crime-solving and social linking with studying, clubs, and job responsibilities.
