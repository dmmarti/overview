 Based on the movie The Fast and the Furious: Tokyo Drift, the game puts you in the shoes of a rookie trying to make it in the world of drift racing. As in the movie, the game is set on the streets of Tokyo (and at night, of course) and stars some of the same characters and their cars. At first, you don't have a lot of cash, but as you win more races and earn more money, you're able to upgrade, customize and trick out your vehicle into a top-notch drifting machine.
