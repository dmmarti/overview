 Buzz! Junior: Jungle Party is the ideal experience for kids of all ages to dive in to. With an easy-to-use Buzzer in hand, go head-to-head against up to three of your mates or family to see if you have the skills you need to build a banana empire and be crowned King of the Jungle. Choose your monkey character with care each has a distinctly naughty personality and then take part in one of up to 40 wild and wacky mini games deep in the jungle.  But the secret to success is not just having a laugh, as you find out if you have what it takes to demolish a Totem pole, beat out the craziest bongo beat with your Orang-utan drum instructor or base jump clutching an anvil! And if you survive all that not to mention being pelted with coconuts and eaten by lions - then it's 'farty' time as you sit back in the jungle Jacuzzi and celebrate with your friends and the windy gorilla just watch out for the smelly bubbles!!  Play is as simple as peeling a banana and the laughs as cheesy as a centipedes shoes. Just choose your character, select the colour of your monkey, enter your name and you are ready for tropical action.
