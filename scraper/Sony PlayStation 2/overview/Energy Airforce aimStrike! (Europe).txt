 Energy Airforce is a realistic flight simulator where the player can pilot many real-life military aircraft such as the F/A-22 Raptor, F-16 Fighting Falcon, and X-35 JSF. It takes a similar approach as racing simulator Gran Turismo, requiring the player to train and pass license tests before more advanced missions and aircraft are unlocked, as only the F-16 is unlocked at the start. However, there are also free Dogfight and Arcade modes where an impatient player can jump straight in.Energy Airforce: aimStrike! is the second title in Taito's military flight sim series, and is greatly expanded over its predecessor. Several new types of aircraft have been added, including the F/A-18 Super Hornet, F-15 Eagle, and A-10 Thunderbolt II, and the need to pass license tests to unlock aircraft has been removed.  As before, the game includes a wide range of missions, including both air-to-air and air-to-surface missions, and there is also a mission generator called Strike Mode, where the player can set up a wide range of options and play a free mission.
