 NBA Live 07 is the second iteration of EA's basketball game series on the PSP. The major update from the 06 version is the inclusion of a Dynasty mode that allows the gamer to play as the general manager of their favorite team. The files created in this mode can be exchanged with the PS2 version.  Other new features for 07 include Freestyle Superstars, which allows gamers to perform special signature moves of NBA superstars during 5-on-5 gameplay. You can change the players' skill attributes on the fly to balance your team with certain play types. In-game coverage is provide through ESPN updates.  This version includes the PSP-only mini-games "Handles" and "2Ball". The "Handles" mini-game is a beat-based dribbling simulator with Dance Dance Revolution-style rhythmic button mechanics. "2Ball" is an arcade style half-court shootout mini-game. In the Superstar Challenge, players can relive memorable moments from the 2000-2006 NBA season and change the outcome. Returning in 07 are the common NBA Live franchise hallmarks such as Season mode and the All-Star Weekend competitions, with the Slam Dunk contest, 3-point Shootout, Rookie Challenge and All-Star game.
