 Alvin and the Chipmunks is a game based on the movie with the same name. Alvin, Simon and Theodore must play at different venues to win the right to play at the battle of the bands event called "Rockathonapalooza." By clearing each venues in Story Mode, the player unlocks more venues to play at. The songs unlocked in Story Mode become available to play in Quick Play and Multiplayer or to watch in Video Mode. The gameplay is similar to Rock Band or Guitar Hero, but without the instruments. Using the controller's buttons, the player must hit the blue, pink, green and yellow Star Targets in sync with the music. Note streaks will give an up to 4x score multiplier bonus, but missing notes will deplete the Rockometer. The song fails if the Rockometer drops and turns completely red.  The track list includes songs such as:The Chipmunk Song – Alvin and the Chipmunks Karma Chameleon – Culture Club All the Small Things – Blink-182 Walkin' on the Sun – Smash Mouth Blitzkrieg Bop – The Ramones
