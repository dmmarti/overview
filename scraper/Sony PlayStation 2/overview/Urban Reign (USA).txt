 Urban Reign is a Namco-produced 3D brawler, done in the tradition of Double Dragon and Final Fight. The story follows Brad Hawk, a hired thug, as he tries to find a gang member that was captured by a rival group. In each level, you set off against a handful of bruisers from one of Green Harbor's many gangs in search of clues. Make use of different allies, which can be given instructions, with skills in various fighting techniques to accomplish your goals, as you fight your way through 100 levels. There are different combos and special moves, different objects can be picked up and used as a weapon, and incoming attacks can be avoided by dodging.
