 A mighty syndicate gives Lara Croft the task to find the Scion, a mystical artifact which is said to be the key to the secret of Atlantis. Since her father already searched for this item, Lara does not hesitate and begins her journey through ancient tombs and forgotten worlds.  Lara Croft Tomb Raider: Anniversary is essentially a remake of the original Tomb Raider. So you fight and riddle your way through familiar sites and meet good old enemies. But also you feel at home, the game features everything that Lara Croft Tomb Raider: Legend has. So besides the better graphics, Lara also has many new moves, such as swinging on ropes, bullet time when an animal rushes towards her, and the addition of a grappling hook in her inventory (which resembles the one from the original game). Jumping is also a lot easier, as the heroine automatically grabs the ledges without requiring pixel-precise timing. There are also completely new moves,  where Lara balances and jumps on small sticks.  The cut-scenes are identical, but rendered in real-time using the new engine. Some are also action-based, like in the previous games, requiring quick reflexes to keep the action going. The environments and riddles have been changed to fit the new gameplay and the voice recording was also redone.
