 As the definitive take on football management, Premier Manager 2005-2006 invites you to take control of your favourite club's destiny. Whether brokering multi-million pound transfers, negotiating TV rights, dealing with player tantrums or squeezing the chairman for cash, one thing is certain. The club's future is in your hands. You may be calling up fixtures, news and medical reports in preparation for the next match, whilst consulting with the scout and junior team coach, all before holding a press conference on the latest antics of the star midfielder and heading off to the big Saturday afternoon match. It's all in a hard day's work, but success is ultimately measured by results. Will it be silverware or P45 this season?
