 In this new Commandos game, converted from real-time strategy to first person shooter with a tactical component, you'll play as a Green Beret for the fast action, as a Sniper for the tactical shooting and as the Spy for the stealth and sabotage bits. In some missions you could use two of them, changing from one to another in real time.  The game, set in the WWII, makes you play in Stalingrad, Norway, and France, side by side with your allies, trying to wreak havoc!  The music is played by the Bratislava Symphony Orchestra and the City Choir of the same city.
