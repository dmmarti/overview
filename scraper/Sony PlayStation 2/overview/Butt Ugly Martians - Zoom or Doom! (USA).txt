 Race the fastest, most futuristic vehicles in the Universe to the ultimate finish line in Butt-Ugly Martians: Zoom or Doom. Emperor Bog is fed up with the antics of the Butt-Ugly Martians, so in order to continue their assignment on Earth, the Butt-Uglies must win the Martian Conquerors' Cup--a heart-pounding inter-stellar racing championship. Players will fight off enemy attacks at every turn as they race, chase and conquer opponents. Kids can victoriously pilot their way through the collection of outrageous races by becoming their favourite Butt-Ugly hero or as an evil alien bent on destruction. The game features nine different tracks, split-screen two-player capability, hidden bonuses and drag racing tracks, and a special Assist Mode option with simplified game controls and easier handling. Zoom or Doom also includes a unique Taunts system to allow players to distract opponents and adversely affect their racing performance.
