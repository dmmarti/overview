 In this instalment of 2K Sports' yearly hockey series, the player can control any of the 30 NHL teams and bring them to Stanley Cup glory on either Franchise or Season mode, or just play them im simple exhibition matches.  The franchise mode was extended, allowing more control of the team during the offseason (such as improvements in the draft and in negotiations), as well as tweaks to player progression and other changes to improve the realism of post-lockout NHL management - waivers, salary cap management, free agents and more. On the ice, while the game remains mostly unchanged, the new Superstar Moves bring a spark of world class hockey to the game, particularly on breakaways and penalty shots.
