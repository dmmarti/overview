 Hiro was orphaned shortly after being born; his parents the king and queen killed by the evil Element Master Akunin. Now fully grown, Hiro sets out to best the four element trials and become an Element Master himself, while Akunin waits for the chance to finish what he started years ago. The elemental trial of Earth is the first Hiro must complete, but after that the three remaining trials, as well as the stages leading up to them, may be attempted in any order. On his quest Hiro will find many weapons of different classes, such a short swords and spears. These weapons will become damaged over time and eventually break, but they can be repaired with an item Hiro can find. After having completed an elemental trial Hiro gains the ability to cast magic of that element, increasing his effectiveness against enemies weak to that element.  In multiplayer mode two players can face off against each other in deathmatch arenas with special rules, such as tag, survival, and time attack.
