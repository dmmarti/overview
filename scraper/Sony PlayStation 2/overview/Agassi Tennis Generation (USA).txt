 In this tennis game with the endorsement of former world no. 1 Andre Agassi, the player has 32 players (all male, of which Agassi is the only real player), every one with their own strengths and 16 tournaments around the world, each with their trademark court (so you can count on Carpet in St. Petersburg, Grass on London, Clay in Paris and Cement on New York). Three game modes are available: Quick game (a simple game where the players sets all options, from location to the participants), Arcade (beating a series of games in a row) and Agassi Tournament, where the player competes for the No. 1 spot.   Gameplay is simple, as usual in most tennis matches. There are four buttons, controlling a simple shot, lob, top and back spin, and to win points, the player must be positioned correctly and add the right amount of direction and strength into the shot (by moving the d-pad). Serving uses a power bar where the player presses a key to toss the ball, and the bar fills up as the best time to hit the ball approaches, when the player hits the button again. Like in Virtua Tennis there are two views, the usual TV camera and a "behind the player" camera. Unlike other games published by Cryo in the Roland Garros series, the camera does not change so that the player is always on the bottom court.
