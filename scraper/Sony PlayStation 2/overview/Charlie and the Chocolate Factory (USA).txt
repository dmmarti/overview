 You play Charlie Bucket, a poor child, on a tour through reclusive confectioner Willy Wonka's fabulous candy factory in this interactive take on the classic children's story.  As Charlie you will attempt to put the factory in working order, cleaning up the messes created by other children on the tour.  You'll have to run, jump, carry objects, push buttons and command a small army of Oompa Loompa assistants on the way to winning the ultimate prize:  the factory itself.
