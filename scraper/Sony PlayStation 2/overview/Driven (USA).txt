 The game Driven is based on the movie by the same name with Sylvester Stallone.  The player competes in a series of open-wheel races that follow the plotline of the movie. Each selected driver has different attributes that effect the performance of the car.  If the driver is skilled enough he can enter “The Zone”. Once in “The Zone”, the car performs at optimum efficiency.   The point of the game is to win the series championship against your arch-rival. The game contains an arcade mode, a story mode and a multiplayer mode.
