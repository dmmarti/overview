 David Douillet Judo is the first 3D judo sports simulation, developed in cooperation with Olympic gold medalist David Douillet with the license of la Fédération Française de Judo. With a focus on realism the game first requires the player to go through a tutorial guided by David, where the different moves (52 in total) are explained. While fighting, it is not possible to perform each of these moves at will. The gameplay consists of fast-paced consecutive sequences where three different moves are suggested. The player has to select a move and perform it with a combination of keys or buttons. Based on the situation and the timing, it is then executed.  Next to the tutorial, three games modes are available: Quick Play, Championship and Career. There are five different dojos to compete with a traditional, regional, national and international setting, and a temple. Nine judokas are available, of which David Douillet is the only real sportsman, with the character bearing his likeness.
