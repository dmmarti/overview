 Tiger Woods returns once again to the video games world, this time in an all new 3D world. Using Headgate Studios TruSwing Technology, golfers move with true realism. More accurate shot detail allows for a more competitive game, and better chances at making the hole.   6 courses, with a choice of 12 golfers (including Tiger, Justin Leonard and many more) are available, plus a host of fictional characters each with a different style of play and attitude towards golf.  Game modes include the usual single player campaign to take the golfing crown, the Tiger Challenge (where you play against or with Tiger Woods on the Tiger Dream 18 holes) and Speed Golf, where the technical aspects of golf are thrown out the window. It's just you against a friend to see who can get to the hole quickest.
