 The Queendom of Falena is a matriarchy ruled by Queen Arshtat. The Sun Rune, one of the legendary 27 True Runes, is said to protect Falena from all dangers and works in conjunction with the Twilight Rune and the Dawn Rune. Recently, the inhabitants of the town of Lordlake had rebelled against the queen's rule. In order to put an end to the rebellion, the queen used the power of the Sun Rune. The immense power of the rune had a strange influence on the queen. The citizens are terrified. You, the prince of Falena, who cannot inherit the throne because of the matriarchy laws, decide to get to the bottom of the things by traveling to Lordlake. Thus begins an adventure that will involve unlocking the power of the True Runes...  Suikoden V is the fifth installment of the series which are loosely based on the classic Chinese novel "Shuihuzhuan" (Water Margin). The traditional elements of the series - such as the ability to recruit 108 characters to help you on your quest, maintaining of an own castle, the rune-based magic system (limited casting of spells instead of magic points) - are all present in this installment. The strategic army battles similar to those of the second and third game are also back. As in the first two games, you have an active party of six characters, and four as back-up. Party formation plays a major role now, as you'll get bonuses from usage of different tactics. The characters can also learn various skills and execute combo attacks which vary depending on the members you currently have in your active party.
