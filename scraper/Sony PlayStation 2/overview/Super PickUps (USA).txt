 Now you can't let the sports car drivers have all the fun. With Super PickUps, the sequel to Super Trucks Racing,  it's the pickup drivers that get to have some of the glory. The small circuit of pickups is brought to with 16 different pickups that can be raced on 20 different tracks. You get to customize your driver and pick your sponsor for your truck. Pick your sponsor carefully that matches your driving style. You'll get awarded upgrades depending on whether you win and your driving style. Much like other racing games you'll be able to upgrade various parts of your truck so you can win more.
