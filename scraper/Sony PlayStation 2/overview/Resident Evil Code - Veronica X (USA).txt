 Resident Evil: Survivor 2 - Code: Veronica is a game based on the Resident Evil franchise, similar in concept to the original Resident Evil: Survivor, though it is not actually related.  It is a port of an arcade game.  As in the original Code: Veronica game, Claire Redfield and Steve Burnside must escape Rockfort Island, which is infested with zombies.  In this case however, the game can be played either with the Guncon 2 lightgun or with the standard controller as a first-person shooter.  Players can choose either character or can play cooperatively as both.  As in most lightgun games, the object is to make it through an environment while shooting enemies.  It is somewhat less typical in that you have full roaming control over your character rather than being stuck on rails.  More unusually, a timer begins as you enter each area.  If the timer runs out before you leave, Nemesis will appear and chase you.
