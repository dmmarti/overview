 Among the 2K6 edition's new features is the Crease Control, which allows you to take direct control of the goalie and slow everything down for a matter of seconds, giving you time to find where the puck is and prepare a save.  NHL 2K6 has a complete feature set, including Franchise Mode, Exhibition, ProControl, On-The-Fly Coaching, the Enforcer system, and, of course, multiplayer over Xbox Live.  Most of the rule changes adopted by the NHL following the lockout of the past season are incorporated into the game.  All your teams are here, from the Toronto Maple Leafs to the Boston Bruins to the Ottawa Senators and the Tampa Bay Lightning.  There are also All-Star and Legend teams to play.
