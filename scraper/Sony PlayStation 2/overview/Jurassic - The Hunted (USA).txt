 Jurassic: The Hunted is a first-person shooter where the players controls weapons and survival expert Craig Dylan. In 1983 an expedition to the Bermuda Triangle disappeared, but almost 30 years later the daughter of Dr. Sayrus, one of the original members, receives the S.O.S. transmission of the long lost team. Dylan is a part of the team hired to investigate, but their plane is struck by a storm and all members need to parachute down, where they are sucked into mysterious energy portals. Craig Dylan suddenly finds himself on an island filled with dinosaurs.  The environment is filled with dense jungle, fortifications and volcano areas. Players need to fight thirteen different types of dinosaurs such as the velociraptor, pterosaur, triceratops, tyrannosaurus and many more. Aside from the straightforward shoot-em-up gameplay, Dylan also has access to an Adrenaline Burst that slows down all the action for more accurate shots. It also lights up the dinosaurs' weak spots in a bright color. The thirteen weapons at his disposal range from a civil war rifle, to crossbows with explosive arrows and even a futuristic plasma rifle. There are also a number of stationary turrets to ward off large hordes.  Next to the regular story mode with twelve levels in total, there is a survivor mode where the player can go against an endless wave of dinosaurs. During the regular mode scattered pieces of a new weapons can be found and when it is fully assembled it becomes available in the survivor mode.
