 Possum is an archaeology researcher at the university, who dreams of becoming a famous archaeologist following in the footsteps of his uncle, except that his other great love is fishing. In fact it is fishing, and not his research, that takes up most of his time! One day, Possum finds an old parchment text describing an ancient and mysterious civilisation: "A culture which worships the fish as a Messenger of God... an ancient science, new species... prehistoric fish". Possum thinks these notes were written by his uncle before he died. He considers for a while, and then says to himself: "This will enable me to catch the biggest fish the world has ever seen!" "I may achieve my dream and be granted the title of professor!" And so Possum's quest begins!
