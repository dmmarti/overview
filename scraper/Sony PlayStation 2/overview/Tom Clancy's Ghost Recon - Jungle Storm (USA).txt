 The year is 2009, and jungles of Cuba never had this kinda heat... and tension. Revolution is taking place as a drug-funded warlord is prepping to take control over the territory. A group of six elite US Army Green Berets, better known as Ghosts are deployed and ready to mess up the plans for the badguys. Aside from singleplayer campaigns, game also features split screen play and several different multiplayer modes for online play.  The game also includes Tom Clancy's Ghost Recon: Island Thunder campaign just to encompass the conflict and give players what was amiss for PlayStation 2 before. Controlling Alpha and Bravo teams of three-by-three, you are now able to give commands to both of your teams via USB headset while fighting first-hand through the use of a gamepad. Voice-recognition supports about 50 different commands given in a way of concatenation WHO+WHAT+WHERE (e.g. Alpha Team Take Cover, or All Teams Attack Objective 2).
