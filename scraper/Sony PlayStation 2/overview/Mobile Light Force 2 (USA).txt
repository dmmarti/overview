 Mobile Light Force 2 is a budget-priced port of AlfaSystem's vertical-scrolling shoot-'em-up, Shikigami no Shiro. It features five levels with three stages each. Extending the replay value is a two-player mode and the ability to select from six characters (three male and three female to be exact). Aside from the standard rapid-fire stream of bullets standard to the genre, a spirit attack unique to each character is available, which significantly slows the ship's movement, but rewards the player with a substantial point increase. Coupled with the spirit attack is the Tension Bonus system, which rewards you with increased power and bonus points based on how close you are to enemies and their bullets.
