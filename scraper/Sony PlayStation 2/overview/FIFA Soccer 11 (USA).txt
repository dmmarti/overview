 FIFA Soccer 11 is a licensed soccer game which allows the player to directly control his athletes. He has various playing modes to his disposal, e.g. single matches, multiplayer or leagues to prove his skill.  The most important improvement to FIFA Soccer 10 is the so-called "Personality+" feature which means that players have special attributes, e.g. poacher, which directly influences the variety of movements the player can use and their success rate on the field. The new passing system allows to set the amount of strength the athlete uses for his passing attempt.  The career mode know includes the option to eventually become a manager or trainer - the player also can choose to play as goalkeeper for the first time. Other smaller changes are the possibility to incorporate own fan songs and the new penalty playing mode.
