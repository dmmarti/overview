 After over 9 years of waiting, Micro Machines V4 is the first true new game in the Micro Machines series and the direct successor to Micro Machines V3.  Just like in Mad Tracks you drive little toy cars through 50 miniature-size all-day environments like over a pool table or through the eaves gutters of a house. On the tracks you can find weapons (e.g. a flamethrower, a monster-hammer or rockets) and power-ups that help you win the race. If you win a race you'll get money which you need to unlock new tracks and cars.  In multiplayer mode up to 4 players can race against each other either on one PC or online. The PS2 version offers multiplayer with multitap and with the PSP version, you can play on one device (two players) or through WiFi (four players). Playing online also features a new twist in the races. If you want to, you can bet your car and if you lose your opponent gets it. You can also trade cars from your collection with others.  An editor to design your own tracks is included in the package. Extra tracks can be unlocked by connecting the PSP to the PS2.
