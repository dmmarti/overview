 In Sonic Unleashed for the Wii and PS2, as in the 360/PS3 version, Eggman defeats Sonic, using the power of the Chaos Emeralds to trap him. The sheer force of that attack broke the planet into pieces, and released Dark Gaia from the depths. Eggman then leaves Sonic trapped on the broken planet, along with the now-useless Emeralds. It is now up to Sonic to re-power the Chaos Emeralds, fix the planet, re-capture Dark Gaia, and, of course, defeat Eggman.  The game features both daytime levels, which focus on Sonic's speed, and nighttime levels, which are more combat-focused, and have Sonic turning into a were-hog, as a side-effect of the Chaos Emerald attack he suffered.  The PS2 and Wii versions feature an almost completely new mix of levels, and a different engine.
