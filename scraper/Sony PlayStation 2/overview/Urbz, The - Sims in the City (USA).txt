 The Urbz is a reworking of the Sims franchise for the console market.  The Sims have finally moved out of the suburbs and into the big city where reputation is the key to success.  Socialize with over sixty unique characters, work jobs in a Sims game for the first time, buy new clothes that are actually gameplay relevant (they affect whether how likely other characters are to like you), get tattoos and body piercings and own and decorate one of three unique apartments.
