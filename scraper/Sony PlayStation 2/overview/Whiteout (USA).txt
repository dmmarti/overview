 This is a snowmobile racing game. The game engine simulates the real physics of a sled on all kinds of surfaces such as snow, ice, mud and many others so the player has to pay an attention to where and how to accelerate, break and turn in order to win a race. AI engine uses a complicated model that simulates real human behaviors so that NPC opponents can fall asleep on fanfares or get reckless in a rage. Making different stunts is not the last tactics that might lead to the win.
