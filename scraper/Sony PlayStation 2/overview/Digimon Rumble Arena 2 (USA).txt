 Pick your favorite Digimon and battle your way to the top in this arena-style fighter based on characters from the Digimon TV show.  You can play through various interactive (and dangerous) arenas for the championship, or you can rumble with your friends in 2-4 player multiplayer mode.  Collect pickups and learn special moves to gain the advantage over your friends, and for the ultimate upgrade, you can evolve (Digi-volve) into bigger and better versions of yourself.
