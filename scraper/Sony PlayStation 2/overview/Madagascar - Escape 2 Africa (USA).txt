 Madagascar: Escape 2 Africa is based on the family movie of the same name.  Shortly after becoming adjusted to being on Madagascar after becoming trapped there, Alex, Marty, Gloria and Mellman get homesick for their old home of New York Zoo and decide to get back there post haste. With the help of the penguins, they make an old crashed plane flyable again, and set off for the big apple with the penguins, monkeys and King Julian in tow. Unfortunately, they develop problems mid flight and crash land in Africa, where Alex meets his father, Marty meets more zebras and Gloria finds love. But then they have to save the Savannah from a water shortage.  Whilst you play, you will be able to control all four main characters. In order to progress through the game, you will have to complete various objectives to aid your escape from Africa, such as sneaking the penguins through the human camp to get supplies, help Gloria search caves for hidden treasure whilst avoiding crocodiles and using a penguin driven car to chase a human convoy and get supplies.  There are several multiplayer tournaments available, including 4 player soccer, mini golf, jungle chess, musical chairs and volcano dancing.
