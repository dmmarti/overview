 Based on the hugely successful Monopoly board games, you have the opportunity to become a millionaire and bankrupt up to four other friends.  Like the original, you must buy property, move around the board, make money and ruin your enemy to survive. This game features all you would expect of the game, fines, "GO", comunity chests and chances.  But unlike the original, your board can be made to be a sci-fi, fantasy, prehistoric or the original board.
