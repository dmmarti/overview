 Bikini Beach: Stunt Racer pits the player against the clock in a desperate, mad dash effort to please the hot mascot babes at various tropical paradises. The player selects from among 3 male characters -- either the surfer jock, the fat party animal, or the drunken lush -- each has his own dune buggy. The goal is to impress trophy women by riding the dune buggy around various courses in Bali, Rio, and St. Tropez and performing increasingly outrageous and daring stunts worth varying points. In addition to a preset number of points, it is also necessary to collect 7 diamonds on the course in order to earn a woman's approval.  The game features a leisurely practice mode to allow the player a relaxed environment for practicing stunts. The game also has an unlockable fourth level for each of the parameters-- a fourth player (an Elvis impersonator), a fourth bikini babe, and a fourth beach (Daytona) to conquer.
