 A group of game developers are deep into the final stages of testing their new game. All of a sudden, their characters revolt and break out of their control, taking on lives and ambitions of their own. A princess character is kidnapped and the only way to save her is to send in heroes from other games. Various warriors and wizards are dispatched to try to save her, but nothing works. As a last resort, Gift, a comical, clumsy, little red alien volunteers and is sent in to save the day.  Basically in 3D arcade fashion, you control Gift who must navigate 10 levels and special rooms, picking up numerous items along the way and meeting characters from other games and films. You’ll recognize the dwarves from Snow White, a Darth Vader’s light sabre, Indiana Jones’ whip, and a machine gun from Quake, among others, as you travel through the levels. He’ll leap between moving platforms, avoid death rays, zap enemies, etc. His progress is often impeded by thought-provoking roadblock type puzzles, which will require your imagination, logic as well as a keen sense of humor.
