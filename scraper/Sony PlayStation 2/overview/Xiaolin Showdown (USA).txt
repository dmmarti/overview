 Xiaolin Showdown is a game based on the animated series of the same name from Warner. It is a fighting game where you play as the four main characters of the show (Kimiko, Omi, Raimundo and Clay). Even if you play alone (the game supports 4 simultaneous players in story mode), the other 3 are present, controlled by the computer. You can also unlock 2 additional characters: Jack Spicer and Chase Young.  The players must defeat waves of enemy robots to collect Shen Gong Wu artifacts to increase their power and defeat series of enemies, until they are able to face Mala Mala Jong and put an end on the plans of the evil boy genius, Jack Spicer. Each Shen Gong Wu provides a new power, like locking nearby characters or punching the ground for area damage. Additional Shen Gong Wu can be bought using coins collected during the game.  The gameplay is inspired by party fighting games, like Power Stone and Super Smash Bros. You can chain combos with button combinations, jump and give flying kicks.  Between the game levels, there are showdowns, where the characters have to bet a Shen Gong Wu. The one that wins the challenge chooses a Shen Gong Wu from the player who lost. You can also only play the showdowns, instead the full story mode.
