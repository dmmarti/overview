 A rhythm and music game -- played using audio triggers instead of visual triggers.  The goal is to piece together each track of a song within a certain time period; not piecing enough tracks together loses the round.    To piece together each track of a song, you use the controller buttons to try to hit marks laid out on the track as they pass underneath your marker.   Complete a track, then move onto the next one.  Once you have completed each track, you are free to jam and mix freely with all tracks of the song in bass, rhythm, vocals, etc.  Each song is broken down into 8 tracks and there are dozens of progressivley more difficult dance songs by major names such as Crystal Method, BT, Juno Reactor, Paul Okenfold, Orbital, Jungle Brothers, DJ QBert, and No Doubt.
