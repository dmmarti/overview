 SeaWorld: Shamu's Deep Sea Adventures is the first ever SeaWorld game for the console and handheld gaming systems. Combining education with entertainment, children will embark on an engaging, story-driven adventure as they take Shamu and Horacio, the ageless Manatee, on an incredible journey to Atlantis and battle Poseidon and his giant beast, the evil Kraken. Through 20 missions and eight underwater environments, players are encouraged to solve the mystery of unexplained disruptions affecting the aquariums and the animal's habitats and successfully return the magic of SeaWorld back to the park.
