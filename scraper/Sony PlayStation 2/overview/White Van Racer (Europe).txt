 Known to many road users, the infamous White Van Man is the workman that drives his light commercial vehicle through traffic in a particularly aggressive and infuriating manner. Frivolous honking and cutting off other road users are his trademark. In White Van Racer, players are given the chance to turn the tables on this modern-day phenomenon, and become a White Van Man of their own.  Selectable vans range from nondescript models to ice cream trucks, mobile burger shops, or business vehicles for painters and window cleaners. While there is no civilian traffic on the roads, drivers compete against up to 4 other computer-controlled vans in a dash for the finish line. There is a total of 12 linear stages, set in 2 scenarios and consisting of variations (direction, time of day) on 4 basic road sections. True to the White Van Man disposition, pushing and shoving competitors is a necessary tactic for the successful driver. Apart from quick race and time trial modes, three championships allow players to unlock more stages and vans.
