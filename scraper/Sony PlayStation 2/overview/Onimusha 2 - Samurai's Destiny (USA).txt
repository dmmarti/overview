 Ten years after the lone swordsman, Samanosuke, rose up against an army of demon warriors, Nobunaga's evil campaign continues to wreak havoc across feudal Japan.  A young warrior, Jubei, returns home to find his remote and once vibrant village in ruins, destroyed by Nobunaga's minions. With vengeance in his heart, Jubei launches upon an epic and magical quest, which will reveal his ultimate destiny.  Like Samanoske before him, Jubei can absorb the souls of defeated monsters to strengthen his weapons and armor. Monsters can be defeated either by attacking them until their health is depleted, or by striking them at the very instant before they hit Jubei. This will make Jubei preform an Issen attack which destroys in a single blow. Jubei can find or buy treasures in the first half of the game, and give these to companions he meets, befriending them. Based on who Jubei befriends the events of the game will change.
