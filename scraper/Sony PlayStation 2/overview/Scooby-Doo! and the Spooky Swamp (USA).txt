 Scooby Dooby Doo! Our favorite canine mystery crusader is back in action with Scooby-Doo! and the Spooky Swamp. Scooby-Doo, Shaggy, Daphne, Velma and Fred are on an all-new adventure to uncover the mystery behind a strange swamp girl and her peculiar cauldron of brew. Players can jump in as any of the Mystery, Inc. characters (including Scooby-Doo) at any time to travel beyond the swamp and into other haunted locales, such as the snow covered Alpine village or the Southwestern ghost town, to uncover more clues and solve the mystery of the strange brew.
