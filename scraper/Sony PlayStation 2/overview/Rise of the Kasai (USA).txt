 Rau, the hero of The Mark of Kri, has fallen in battle. Take control of Griz and Baumusu through the timeline of events ten years prior to discover what exactly happened to Rau. Then, take control of Rau and Tati to find out what happens in the decade that follows the events of The Mark of Kri.  Featuring a beat-'em-up style of gameplay, this action adventure differentiates itself by using a targeting system allowing the player to effectively fight oncomers from all directions. The addition of three new playable characters allows for an extension in play mechanics from the first title, opening the possibilities for different strategies depending on who the player chooses to use. Another addition is the partner system that has the AI control your partner as you traverse each stage.
