 The PS1 Destruction Derby titles would put you in the seat of a high powered vehicle, in either an arena or a track, and the target was to race to the finish, while causing as much destruction to the other cars as possible.  Now comes the PS2 sequel.  Because this is now on the PS2, the capabilities are much higher, so now there is a vastly improved graphics engine, physics engine, and levels.  There are now loads of online play modes to try, with up to 19 other racers online with you, and now, the crashes are bigger than ever.
