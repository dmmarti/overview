 As the first Rugby title on the Playstation 2, EA Sports Rugby is a full on simulation of the sport (played mainly in Europe, Australasia and Africa). All of the major nations of rugby are represented, including Australia (the current World Cup champions), New Zealand, England, France and South Africa. The game is also fully licenesed with every player of every team rendered into the game.  There are many trophies to be won, here's a quick run down:  World Cup: Much the same as the Football variety, the best in the world fight to become world champions.  6 Nations: Only 6 nations are represented in this European tournament to play as: Scotland, England, Wales, Ireland, France and Italy.  Tri-Nations: Australia, New Zealand and South Africa play in this tournament.  Bledisloe Cup: It's Australia vs New Zealand, in a best of three tournament.  Calcutta Cup: Much like the above, except it's England and Scotland that fight it out.
