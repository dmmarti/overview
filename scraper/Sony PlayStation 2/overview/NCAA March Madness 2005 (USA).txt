 Electronic Art's 2004 incarnation of the NCAA Basketball franchise comes with some brand new features.  With a sophisticated play calling system you can call your plays with still moving the ball down the court to get your team mates in contention.  The dynasty mode goes up to 30 years with a recruiting system that keeps up to date of your prospects while keeping your other players in line just in case they decide to stray from their studies or worse.  You can play one on one against the computer or against a buddy, playing in custom tournaments, rivalry games or even play as your favorite teams mascots.  It also features the all-new Pontiac College Classics, allowing you to recreate classic games from the past or even rewrite history.  The game also features the voices of Brad Nessler and the legendary Dick Vitale.
