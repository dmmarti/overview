 SOCOM II is the sequel to the hit tactical action game SOCOM: U.S. Navy SEALS. SOCOM II like the original puts you in command of a deadly four-person squad who must strike targets in 12 international missions.  Being the leader of the crew you can command your squad with a USB headset to cover you, bang and breach, and all out attack among other things.  The main draw of SOCOM II is the online play. The game allows you to play online with up to 15 other friends while communicating with them through a USB headset. Weather its extracting, killing, or defusing Socom II delivers it in spades. Create a clan and take over the leader board, start a rivalry between others. It can be done.
