 3-on-3 arcade-style basketball with over 50 of the NBA's all time greatest players.  Enter a Legends Tournament and travel back in time as you work your way up through the ranks in head-to-head battle with the best from each era.  Each time you defeat a team their players are available for you to use in creating your ultimate dream team.  And for some real high-flying action build up your Jam Meter and hit the lights with the over 40 unique Monster Dunks.  This game feautres tons of unlockables (teams, courts, and cheats) as well as commentary by Tim Kitzrow and Bootsy Collins.
