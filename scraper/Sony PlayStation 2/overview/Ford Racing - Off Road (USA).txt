 As you might expect, this game takes the Ford Racing series off the road, and into the desert, forest, and ice. Features 12 tracks, (plus reverse versions of all tracks) and 18 Ford and Land Rover vehicles.  Game modes include Quick Race, which drops you right in the action, Career mode, which starts you out with a few thousand credits and a map of the nearest races, Tournament, which is a shorter version of Career mode, Arcade mode, which lets you play a single race with the track, mode, and vehicle you want, and Multiplayer, which lets you race split-screen. Some tracks and vehicles need to be unlocked through career mode before they become available.
