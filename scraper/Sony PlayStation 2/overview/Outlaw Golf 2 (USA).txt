 Following the style of its predecessor, the original Outlaw Golf, the game stays true to bad attitude, sexual themes and bunch of losers who just happen to find something in common to take upon - a game of golf. The magnificent four are back, Harley, Summer, El Suave and Ice Trey, with several more characters to be unlocked as you blast through the courses, speaking of which, the former three from the original are back, and again, with newer ones to be played after earned and unlocked. If you wanna practice your moves and skills, you can select exhibition mode, or if you feel contempt enough, go take a tour and show 'em what you're made of. There are several additions not seen in the original game, such as different game modes as well as golf cart racing which lets you earn the legendary burning shot, though the beating of your caddy to raise your composure is still included. The game also supports online play.
