 Enthusia Professional Racing is a driving simulation that features hundreds of licensed vehicles from dozens of various manufacturers. The cars vary in type, class, and time periods, so you can find some old timers as well as family cars and test them on the given tracks, race against another player in split-screen mode, or play the Enthusia Life mode and fill in your garage with as many cars as you can hold, or try the Driving Revolution to tune up your driving skills.  You can drive in first-person view or looking at the car from the typical back third-person view, with some extras you can turn on, such as VGS (Visual Gravity System) which provides detailed information about car handling and tire traction. The cars in this game are true to their physics (you can see a movie comparison of real car and Enthusia ingame car if you wait a little while on main menu), more than 300 different physics parameters were reproduced for every car.
