 In this 3D puzzle game, roll through all the blocks, using color switches to get different colored blocks. If there wasn't a time limit (in the form of your Mojo level), it might even be easy.  Mojo! features over 100 levels, with obstacles and powerups to help and hurt you, along with a level editor. Up to four player can face each other in Battle Mode and Mini-Golf Mode.
