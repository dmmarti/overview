 In the future, on the planet Allium, the situation has become desperate. This world has suffered from global warming, causing the polar ice caps to melt. The rising sea has resulted in the amount habitable land to decrease dramatically. All that is left are island chains, making land the most valuable resource on the planet. The entire population  must survive and compete over these islands.  Currently, there are two distinct civilizations on Allium, settled into an uneasy cease-fire. There are the scientifically advanced Forseti and the aggressive Muspell. The Forseti have recently developed the most advanced combat vehicle in existence, the Battle Engine Aquila. The Aquila is both a four-legged mechanized tank and a combat jet, it is capable of switching modes at will. Players take the role of Hawk Winter, a Forseti cargo loader operator who has been conscripted because of his piloting skills.  Battle Engine Aquila is a mechanized shooter taking place in a larger battlefield. The player plays only a single, yet important, role in a larger war effort. A large part of the gameplay consists of supporting and being supported by the allied forces. Players will have to fight navel, air, and ground forces in both modes of their battle engine.
