 This game is based on the MTV series Pimp My Ride, in which people have their cars 'pimped up'. This is done by modifying it with things like adding nitrous, new rims, tinted windows and vinyls externally and adding things like new seats, T.V sets, music players and games consoles inside. You start with the host of the show, Xzibit, lending you his car, and you must go out into in a five borough area called 'Pimp City'. At this point, you can take part in various mini games throughout Pimp City in order to earn money and buy your own car, and then pimp it.  While pimping your ride, Pimp My Ride's host Xzibit will be on hand to help you. Once you have completed your car's pimping out, you can take your new looking ride out for a spin into Pimp City, essentially turning the game into a free roaming racer, and earn money and complete various challenges and races in order to progress through the game.
