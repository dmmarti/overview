 Licensed by the late 2001 World Rally Champion, Richard Burns, this rally game tries to find a niche by adding more depth and realism to the racing experience. This is reflected in the car handling, the influence of the weather and the endless tweaking of the car set-up. There are eight officially licensed cars to choose from, with familiar names such as the Subaru Impreza, Citroen Xsara, Peugeot 206, Mitsubishi Lancer Evo and Toyota Corolla, but you need to unlock them by finishing school lessons, winning a rally or making it to the end of a season.  Next to the usual training, quick races, rally seasons and multiplayer mode (only 4-player 'hot-seat'), you can test your skills in the Richard Burns Challenge, a time trial mode in which get the chance to go head to head with Burns himself. There are 36 stages in total, divided over six countries. The in-game music has been produced by Paul Oakenfold, Andy Hunter, Pepe Deluxe and the Plump DJs.
