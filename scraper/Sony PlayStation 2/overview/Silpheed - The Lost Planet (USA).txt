 Silpheed continues the arcade shooter tradition, mixing old-school action with new age 3D graphics and cinematics. The aim of the game, as usual, is to fly your craft through thousands of enemies, as well as bosses that take up most of the screen. You have plenty of weapons and shields to work with, but if you run out of lives you have to start right back at the beginning of the level.
