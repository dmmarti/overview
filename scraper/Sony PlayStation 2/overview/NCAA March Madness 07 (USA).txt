 NCAA March Madness 2007 is a college basketball game with a realistic simulation of basketball in an authentic college atmosphere. The crowds are rowdier and more colorful, and the AI is more focused on the team game rather than the individual match-ups seen in the NBA.  You can play as one of over 320 division college basketball teams in various game modes, such as PlayNow, Dynasty, and Online. Dynasty mode allows you to take control of your school recruiting and other activities in order to build your team into a powerhouse that will win the NCAA championship.
