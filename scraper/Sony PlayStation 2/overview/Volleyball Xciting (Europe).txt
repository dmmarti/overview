 Volleyball Xciting is a very arcade-like and light volleyball experience for those not looking for that ultra realistic feeling many sports games try to achieve.  It features an all girl cast of cell-shaded manga girls, starting out with 8 teams but more are added as you unlock them along with more courts to play at as you progress through the game.  The game contains several modes of playing, such as World Exhibition and Beach Volleyball, and you can play as many as 4 people at the same time with the aid of a multi-tap.  You never have to move the players around the court yourself as they do it themselves, and you just have to time the shots with the corresponding button to make them whack the ball across the net.
