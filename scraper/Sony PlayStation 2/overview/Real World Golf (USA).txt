 Real World Golf is a golfing game that makes use of the Gametrak system. The Gametrak is an external piece of hardware that is included with the game. The Gametrak can, through the use of gloves which are connected to it with tiny wires, accurately read out the swing the player makes with the included tiny golf club. It determines the power with which you hit, but also any effects you may put on the ball. The Gametrak can read out speeds ranging from 2000 miles per hour to 1 millimeter per hour.  Once you start the game you no longer need to use your keyboard or gamepad, all menus can be navigated with use of simple hand gestures. The game itself contains ten 18-hole courses which have to be unlocked one by one. You can play in various modes such as tournament, championship, training and party. Party mode includes several mini games such as hitting cars in the parking lot, hitting a giant bulls-eye in the sky, hitting as close to a target as possible or hitting through hoops. Each game mode can be played against the AI or friends in hotseat multiplayer.
