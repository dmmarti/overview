 After taking an extra year to bring the NBA franchise up to speed, 989 Sports is taking hoops to a whole new level with NBA ShootOut 2003. The gang at 989 has taken the time to add a number of features that are entirely new to the franchise. The new career mode will allow you to create a player and take him from the NBDL to the NBA Finals if you have what it takes to bang with the big boys. A new practice mode will help you hit your shots from anywhere in the field or get your free-throw percentage up into the 90s. Create Dunk has made the transition to next-generation gaming. Now you are able to choreograph your personal hops and aerobatics worthy of a dunk contest title. Fast-paced NBA action, authentic NBA AI, player models, graphics, and new features will make NBA ShootOut 2003 a must-have hoops title. It is certainly the best rendition in the history of the franchise.
