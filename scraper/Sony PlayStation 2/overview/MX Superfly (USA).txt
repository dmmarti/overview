 Following the success of MX 2002, THQ is back with an all new Supercross game.  MX Superfly offers 27 different pro riders, including top MX rider Ricky Carmichael and a variety of bikes you can use to customize the game action.  There are 22 tracks, an assortment of freestyle arenas and a few mini games giving you lots of places to experiment with tricks and all out racing.  The game offers exhibition race, freestyle and career modes.  There are a number of unlockable items including new riders, bikes, tracks and mini-games.  New in this edition is the track editor which allows you to create your own stunt tracks.  The graphics are well done and the soundtrack is above par for this genre of game.
