 Soul Nomad and the World Eaters is a strategy/RPG hybrid and takes place in Prodesta, a place where war has has ravaged the land for thousands of years. The story is centered around Gig, the Master of Death, an evil god, who formerly tried to destroy the world with beings he controlled called the World Eaters. Gig was ultimately defeated by the forces of good and trapped inside an obsidian blade, which was later hidden in a small village.  The player plays a young boy or girl, who lives in this small village, and coming of age is given this sword, unleashing Gig to posses the player's body. However, the protagonist's will is strong and Gig cannot fully control him/her.  Unit squads can be stored and managed in "rooms", pocket dimensions that can be accessed any time. These rooms can be outfitted with decorations to give the contained squad certain buffs and the rooms can be upgraded to give the main character stat bonuses. Also the units can be arranged into different formations. Each squad also has a leader, whom are extremely important, as if the leader is defeated, the whole squad is lost.  The battle system presents the attackers and defenders on each side of the screen, each side takes turns in battle, but squads attack in a group, rather than individually.
