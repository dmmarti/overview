 Karaoke Stage 2 continues the saga of the Karaoke Revolution series with new modes and songs. The Karaoke Revolution series lets players sing into a microphone and get real-time feedback on their performance. An indicator bar lets you know where to sing and if you're high or flat. You can also sing an octave higher or lower if you're out of your range. Sing well, and the crowd will love you.
