 This version of Lemmings is a port of the PSP version released earlier in 2006. The main difference is the optional use of the EyeToy camera as a direct way to influence the gameplay. The player has to stretch his/her limbs in the recorded picture to help the Lemmings. There are 20 new levels which specifically utilize this new control method.  The player's duty still consists of driving Lemmings, mindless beings, from the start of each level to the end of it. Various commands can or need to be given to the Lemmings. Of course a minimum quantity of Lemmings is requested to be brought to the end of the level safe, extra ones saved will lead to a reward in terms of score.
