 Twisted Metal: Black is the fifth game in the car-combat series.  Only on the PlayStation 2, TM:B includes old favorites and a lot of new characters.  The game has a very dark and gothic theme to it, with the music to back it up.  Detailed graphics, day/night cycle, particle effects, and a constant 60 frames per second.  TM:B also boasts a multiplayer mode, with 1-4 multiplayers, over ten arenas (some specific to multiplayer), and a cooperative mode, so instead of fighting each other, you can work together.  The game's soundtrack consists of techno/gothic music, with some industrial, and acoustic guitar bits, especially the ending credits, "Paint It Black."
