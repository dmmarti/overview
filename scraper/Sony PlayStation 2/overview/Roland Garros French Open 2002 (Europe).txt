 Roland Garros French Open 2002 is the 2002 version of the annual Roland Garros tennis game. It sports an official license for the Roland Garros and US Open tournaments. The game comes with 4 official and 6 fictional players.  The game features the following game modes: arcade, training, exhibition, career, endurance and multi-player. All modes can be played in both singles and doubles. The arcade mode allows you to unlock new courts, players and gear. In the career mode you can start out small and use the cash prizes to further train your character and buy better gear.  You walk around with the arrow keys and you have four different ways to hit the ball: top spin, no spin, back spin and lob. By pressing an arrow key while hitting the ball you'll aim it at a different direction. Multiple difficulty levels can be selected and 17 different courts are available.
