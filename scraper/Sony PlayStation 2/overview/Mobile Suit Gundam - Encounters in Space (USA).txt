 Fight in the One Year War on four different fronts. In White Base mode play as Amuro Ray through the closing months of the One Year War. In Thoroughbred mode take control of Ford Romfellow and experience the events of the manga Mobile Suit Gundam Side Story: Space, To the End of a Flash. In Mission mode create your own Federation or Zeon pilot and train their skills and abilities over eight missions. In Ace Pilot mode see the war from the view of characters from the One Year War and 0083: Stardust Memory, as well as characters from the model line Mobile Suit Variations and the video game trilogy Mobile Suit Gundam: Side Story: The Blue Destiny.  Select from over 70 mobile suits (although your MS is usually chosen for you outside of Versus mode) with their own stats, equipment list, and special attacks. Combat takes place in 3-D space where you have complete control of a unit's forward, backward, and side to side movement as well as pitch and yaw. Boosting can be used to move faster, and barrel rolling will break any enemies' target locks on your MS. Units are equipped with melee weapons as well as ranged weapons, but ranged weapons have limited ammunition and must reload or cool down after being expended. Missions consist of both auto-scrolling segments where the player must avoid obstacles and destroy visible targets as well as arena segments where the player must track down nearby targets.  In Versus mode you can challenge either the computer or another player to one on one combat with a team of 1-3 pilots and MSs. Each MS and weapon has a point cost, and a team's total point cost can not exceed 300 points. Additional pilots and MSs can be unlocked by achieving high scores in the other modes' missions. Ever wanted to pit Char in the Byg-Zam against Amuro piloting the Dendrobium? Now you can.
