 In Super Trucks Racing, you have the ability to race five-ton, 1,400 hp trucks with official professional teams, trucks, drivers and tracks. Drive carefully because any damage done to your truck will be visible and will affect the truck's ability to perform. The race marshals are also watching for any aggressive maneuvers against other drivers and they will penalize or disqualify you for doing so. Before each race, there will be a number of options to enhance your driving performance. Use the provided race or drift truck setups or create your own by adjusting your truck's tire pressure levels, suspension, steering locks and traction control. You are also able to practice on a track before you play to become familiar with your truck and the circuit. You can also qualify to try and get a front spot on the starting line. Six game modes are available to play. In Single Race Mode, quickly race against computer opponents with any unlocked vehicle and track. Championship Mode allows the competition of five championship races, each progressing in difficulty. Try to unlock all the extra trucks and circuits in this game mode. In Arcade Mode, you are to race against the clock and try to make each checkpoint to continue in the race. Time Trial Mode provides freedom to roam a track by yourself to try and make a record lap time. VS Mode is a split-screen competition involving two human players. Lastly, in Survival Mode, you will start out in last place and try to work your way to first place. After each lap, the truck in last place is disqualified. After it is all said and done, head over to the replay theater to playback your saved replays. Or take a gander in the trophy room to see all the trophies you have received. Then take a view at your records where you can view all of your great racing achievements.
