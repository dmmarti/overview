 The Shadowforce Team is an elite and secretive team deployed for situations of national security. The commisioner of Alpha City, the nation's capital has requested the aid of Shadowforce against a mysterious terrorist organization. Deployed to the field, Special Agents Dean Travis and Karen Bride must engage and defeat the terrorists and discover the truth and conspiracy behind their demands. A conspiracy of a hidden invasion...  Hidden Invasion is a 3rd person fighting game. Controlling either Dean Travis or Karen Bride, the player relies on hand-to-hand combat and different weapons to defeat foes. Hand-to-hand includes the ability to punch, kick, block and perform combos thereof. Weapons include shotguns, machine guns, energy weapons and assasult rifles, as well as a standard police pistol holstered on the player. Each weapon uses a target-and-shoot system to a single button, based on line of sight. While the game has full 3D environments, movement is only allowed in the proximity of certain predefined paths. Level objectives include disarming bombs, finding keycards and defeating terrorist leaders.  The US Playstation 2 release features an additional two player cooperative mode where both agents can be used at once. The game tracks progress via a password.
