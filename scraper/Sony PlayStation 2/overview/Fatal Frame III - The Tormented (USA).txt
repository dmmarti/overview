 The Fatal Frame series is back. Rei Kurosawa's fiancé, Yuu Asou, dies in an ugly car accident when she is driving. She enters a haunted mansion as part of a reporting assignment. Here she is frightened by images of her dead fiancé. The game incorporates the camera mode from the previous games, used to capture ghosts. You use the camera obscura not only as a weapon to capture ghosts but as a guide by taking pictures of the ghosts and creepy objects in the house in order to solve the mystery and get rid of the curse. You walk around with a strobe light looking for clues to the mystery.  Throughout the course of the game you can play as three women and switch between a dream world and real-life. All in all, it carries over the same Japanese horror theme as the first two.
