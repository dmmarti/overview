 World Soccer Winning Eleven 9 pushes the franchise one level up towards realism by expanding and improving character moves and control. Now, the match feels more real to the actual play as players make mistakes more often and passes don't go too well if the player is on the wrong foot, or makes a bad turn. The new gameplay may require slight adjustment for players to switch from older versions to this one. The standard modes are here, match mode (with newly added memorial match), various leagues, and cups. Some more teams now have their proper names (like "Arsenal" and "Chelsea"), and are having up to date players in the teams. Also, new weather condition has been added, snow.
