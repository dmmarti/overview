 The Spiderwick Chronicles is based off of the film by the same name.  In this version, the player takes control of the Grace siblings, Jared, Simon and Mallory, each with their own strengths abilities as well as Thimbletack the Brownie who's small size can explore small passages on the Spiderwick mansion.  The gameplay consists of exploring the estate with their characters in a series of "quests" looking for ordinary items such as hose nozzles, solving puzzles, fighting mythical creatures such as trolls and goblins with novel weapons each distinctive to each character such as slingshots, baseball bats and squirt guns filled with vinegar. Players can also acquire special abilities and replenish their health by capturing fairies using a fairy net that are scattered throughout the stages.  The games are virtually the same sans their respective graphics engine and the control scheme (the PS2 and Xbox 360 using the D-Pad, Analog and Button Schemes, the PC version uses the Mouse and Keyboard and the Wii uses the Wii-Remote and Nunchuk).
