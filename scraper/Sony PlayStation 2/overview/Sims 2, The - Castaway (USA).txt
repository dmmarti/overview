 The Sims 2: Castaway is a continuation of the Sims 2 universe.  This time around the player takes control of a Sim washed ashore on a deserted island and must help him/her to survive and find a way home.  The game has the player explore the island, collecting supplies and materials for food and shelter while exploring for clues to help them home while trying to survive the many obstacles scattered throughout the island including the forces of nature.  Exploring and finding treasures can also teach their Sims many useful skills, including fashioning better shelters and making meals that their Sim can stomach.  Players can also create their own Sim much like the other versions, customizing from the hair and skin color to height and weight.  The games are almost identical, excluding the graphics and control scheme (the Wii utilizes the Wii remote while the PSP and PS2 are almost identical).
