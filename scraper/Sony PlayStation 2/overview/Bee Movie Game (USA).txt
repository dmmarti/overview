 Bee Movie Game is based on the animated movie with the same name. Play as Barry B. Benson and prove that there's more to being a bee than just making honey.   Playing as Barry, you retell your story through a series of flashbacks, while you work odd jobs around New York and Barry's hive. There are various mini-games that need to be completed to continue the story. Gameplay includes controlling Barry on foot, in the air, and driving around town.  Exclusive to the Wii version are 3 Bee speedway tracks, 4 additional maxi-games and 6 new competitive 2-player arcade games.
