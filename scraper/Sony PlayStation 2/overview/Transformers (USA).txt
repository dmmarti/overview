 On the planet of Cybertron, the Transformer war between the heroic Autobots and the evil Decepticons rages on. But the losses are mounting up, and the war's front has been pushed into the heart of Autobot territory. The Autobotsâ€™ last stand takes a turn for the worse when the Decepticons introduce their secret weapon: the new Decepticlone army.   As if by fate, a distress signal from the Mini-Cons, the long-lost third Transformer race, blasts onto the battlefield. Knowing that the Mini-Cons will tip the balance of power, the Autobots and the Decepticons race to Earth. On Earth, the Decepticons and their army invade the planet with extreme prejudice. It is then up to the Autobots to save Earth and prevent the Decepticons from controlling the universe.  The player takes control of one of 3 featured Autobots and can switch between them for any mission. These are: Optimus Prime, Hot Shot and Red Alert. All have the ability to transform into their vehicle modes, with classic '80s transforming sound effects.  Players have to find and retrieve Mini-Con robots (of which there are over 40), which then function as weapons or equip the Autobot with new abilities. These add-ons include offensive weapons such as Missile Launchers, Limpet Mines, a Tractor Beam, Electric Arc Guns, Ribbon Beams, etc.; defensive abilitles such as Shields, Armours and Recharges; and Abilities such as Glide Wings, Boost Jumps, and Dashes.   The player must battle the Decepticons and their Decepticlone army through a range of environments including the Amazon jungle, desolate Antarctica and a rugged Pacific island.  Level enemies take the form of uniquely-designed Decepticlones - champions from an army of robots created to serve the Decepticons.  All of the famous Decepticons are featured as game Bosses - including Starscream, Cyclonus, Tidal Wave (as a full-scale Aircraft Carrier/robot) and of course... the Decepticon leader, Megatron.  A classic battle of good versus evil...
