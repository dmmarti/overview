 Use your PlayStation 2 to mix House records. The game gives you two decks, mixer, sampler, effects unit and loops unit and lets you loose on 70 tunes from the likes of Masters at Work, Dimitri from Paris, Shapeshifters, DJ Gregory, Francios K.  This really isn't a game in the traditional sense as there are no highscores to beat. It's purely about being creative and creating a mix which your audience will enjoy. Play in one of two live modes or record your mix to memory card.
