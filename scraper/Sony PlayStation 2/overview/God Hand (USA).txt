 When assaulted by a gang of vicious thugs, a shady drifter named Gene gets his right arm cut off.  When he comes to, he finds himself with a young girl at his side, and his right arm reattached.  But this is no longer an ordinary arm: it's been replaced with the legendary 'God Hand', and now that he's got it, Gene's on the hunt by every demon in the county, as they all want their hands on his.  And with four powerful figures planning the demise of the world, things are probably gonna get ugly.  God Hand is a Western action-based game where you, well, punch enemies in the face repeatedly with an incredibly powerful fist.  Trying to explain the button configuration in God Hand is tough - the player can completely customize their attacks to their liking, as well as earning new ones.  You can choose to set up a combo for four presses of the square button (choosing each attack for each press), or select your more powerful special attacks and juggles.  By moving the right Analog Stick, you'll also perform a dodge in that direction.  Sometimes, stunning an enemy will cause a "press this button" icon to appear on-screen (somewhat like God of War, if you perform well at this bonus prompt, you'll deal some extra damage to the enemy.  Once you've wailed on enemies enough with your regular fists, your 'Tension Gauge' will become full and you can press R2 to use the God Hand itself.  This will make you completely invincible, more powerful and speed you up for a brief time.  You also have the option to use 'Roulette Moves', which use a special attack depending on the one you have selected.  Like all good Westerns, God Hand also features a Casino.  In here, you can gamble your life away, by your choice of the slots, video poker, or blackjack.  Cash earned at the Casino can be used to purchase all sorts of moves for Gene as well as other power ups.
