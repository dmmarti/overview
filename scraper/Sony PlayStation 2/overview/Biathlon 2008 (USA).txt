 Biathlon 2008 is the seventh part in the Biathlon series. Like its predecessor it allows you to play the Biathlon on your PC.   Biathlon consists of two elements: cross-country skiing and rifle shooting on a shooting range. The racing parts require the player to keep an eye on his avatar's stamina so he won't be worn out. In the shooting sequences he has to shoot five stationary targets as quickly as possible. The game features 17 tracks to race on spread across 13 different locations. Players can compose their own characters from different stats that determine their prowess in various skills. Top bi-athletes Magdalena Neuner, Kati Wilhelm, Michael Greis and Sven Fischer are also playable.  Multiplayer is possible through 4-player hot seat and 2-player split-screen mode.
