 Heroes of Might and Magic: Quest for the DragonBone Staff is really the old classic King's Bounty from New World Computing for the PC with revamped graphics. Very little else has changed, in fact even the text was the exact same with the original.   For those who are not familiar with the history of the series, King's Bounty was a spin-off of the Might and Magic RPG series which was then still in its early chapters and was inspired by board games. The gameplay resembles a simplified Heroes of Might and Magic game with only one Hero and no city improvements. Combat is turn-based using a set grid and stacked units.   The goal of the game is to discover an ancient artifact by collecting pieces of a map and identifying its location before time runs out. Of course the player must have amassed a strong army by then because he will have to face the evil Dragon overlord before the end.
