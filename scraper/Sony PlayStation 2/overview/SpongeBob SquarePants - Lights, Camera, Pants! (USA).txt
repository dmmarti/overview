 Multiplayer party game based on the popular kids show SpongeBob Squarepants, where a TV show has pitted the characters of Bikini Bottom to outplay each other in a variety of fun games with the chance to be TV idols for the new "Mermaid Man and Barnacle Boy" TV special.   The game is a panoply of old and new styles of fast action party games, with popularity points determining the winners and losers of each game. The elements of the final TV show are built slowly and surely as each game progresses, with up to four players competing for the prizes.
