 Rollercoaster World is an Theme Park or Rollercoaster Tycoon style game, where you build your own amusement park and its rollercoasters and you have to end each month with money on the account. The rollercoasters are designed in a four window 3D view, in the style of many 3D model editors.  There are several other attractions to build, but the focus is on the rollercoasters, which you can ride in 3D. The game includes 3 modes of play: "Challenge mode", in which you have to construct a rollercoaster which accomplishes a set goal (like a thrill value above 100, safety above 50, maximum and minimum heights and so on), while avoiding to construct a device which will kill off all your visitors (as the ride goes on you get statistics on how people feel and if anyone has fallen off), "Management mode", which allows you to construct and run an entire amusement park, research new attractions and make sure you keep the money flowing, and a "Quick Ride mode", where you ride pre-built roller coasters.
