 One night the monkey Darwin dreamt of a meteoroid flying towards the earth and destroying all life. Only he would be able to stop it, but not as he was now. For the sake of his tribe Darwin and his people would need to venture out into the world and evolve.  During the game the player is directly in control of Darwin, but can also command the followers directly around him. These followers can be commanded to attack animals, carry items, or complete tasks such as building ramps and bridges. Finding items while exploring can increase Darwin's stats and the number of followers he can bring with him. Items can also be returned to Darwin's village to expand and upgrade the services available there, such as healing at the mess hall or recruiting additional followers at the bar.
