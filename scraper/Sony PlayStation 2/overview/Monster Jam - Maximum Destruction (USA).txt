 Using recognizable Monster Trucks, Monster Jam Maximum Destruction is a fast action vehicle combat game. Players control the awesome power of a huge monster truck to smash through walls, leap over buses, and grind opponents beneath their tires. Damaged truck pieces deform, blacken, bend and eventually fall off under the fury of savage vehicular combat.
