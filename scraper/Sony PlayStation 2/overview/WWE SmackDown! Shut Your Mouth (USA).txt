 WWE Smackdown! Shut Your Mouth features an updated roster with even more World Wrestling Entertainment superstars, including Hollywood Hulk Hogan, Stacy Keble, DDP, Ric Flair, and many more.  The revamped season mode allows the player take an untested wrestler through the ranks of the WWE while reliving moments that have happened in the past year of the WWE, such as the co-ownership storyline between Vince McMahon, Ric Flair and the reintroduction of the NWO. Also added is a create-a-wrestler mode that allows the player to customize nearly every physical aspect of his wrestler, including animations.
