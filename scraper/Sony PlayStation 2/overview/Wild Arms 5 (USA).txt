 In the fifth Wild Arms game, the player returns to the spaghetti western world of Filgaia as the young Dean Stark. Dean is a boy who dreams of becoming a hunter of golems, the huge, ancient machines that were once built to serve mankind. Along with his childhood friend Rebecca Streisand, and Avril Vent Fleur, a mysterious girl who falls from the sky, Dean sets out on an adventure to chase his dream of becoming a golem hunter and to help Avril recover her memories.  Wild Arms 5 is a third-person role-playing game where the player explores the world and fights battles in turn-based combat sequences with up to 3 characters in your party. The playing field during combat is split in seven hexagonal sections, of which some have special properties. Players can use guardian beasts, combination arts (team work), chain attacks, original attacks and others. Just like the previous game, these are based on a force meter, which increases when characters attack or are being attacked.  In the exploration mode, Dean and his party can use vehicles or run around, and during dungeon exploration there are two modes: Action (jumps, slides, interaction) and Shooting (through ARMs, Dean can choose from various cartridges to interact with the environment, destroying or manipulating it).
