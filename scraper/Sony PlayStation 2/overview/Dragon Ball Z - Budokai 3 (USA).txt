 All the power of DBZ is yours. A Hall of Fame cast of the greatest DBZ, DBGT and DBZ movie characters meet for first time for some of the fastest paced, highest intensity battles ever seen. New abilities include, for the first time on PlayStation 2, the ability to fly at will in a DBZ fighting game. Pummel your foes on the ground and in the air.  In North America, an exclusive re-release package of the game (for the PlayStation "Greatest Hits" line) was released. It contained extras not included in the original black label release. This special version includes an unlockable bonus feature that lets you listen to the original Japanese voice over cast, as well an additional unlockable costume for Goku, Piccolo, and Trunks. It also uses the original Japanese cover art for the case.
