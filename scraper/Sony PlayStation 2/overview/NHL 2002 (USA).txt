 NHL 2002 is EA's latest incarnation of their NHL series.  New features over previous years includes the "Breakaway Cam", which causes the game to slow down, turn blue, and go into letterbox mode when you're one on one with the goalie, and "EA GameStory", which tracks your progress and rewards you for outstanding performance.  NHL 2002 is the first in the series to include NHL Cards, which is the equiviliant of Madden's NFL Cards.  By performing special moves, such as scoring within the first 30 seconds or winning 10 face-offs, you get points, which you can then use to buy cards.  NHL 2002 includes all the professional NHL teams, as well as the International teams, such as Team Canada and U.S.A.  Every stadium is included, and so is every player.  NHL 2002 has many game modes, including Season, Quick Play, Shootout, and Exhibition.  It also has a "Create-A-Skater" mode.
