 The legendary rhythm game that started a craze in Japan makes its first outing in America! beatmania features over fifty songs from the classic beatmania and beatmania IIDX games, as well as a few originals.  The game includes a special turntable controller with a scratchpad and seven keys. You have to press the seven buttons and move the scratchpad according to what appears on screen, and the better you do, the more points you'll get!  This version of the game is different from other releases. Even though the game is called beatmania, it is closer both in appearance and play modes to beatmania IIDX.
