 Like its predecessors, OutRun 2006 is an old-school arcade racer, which means that your cars don't have realistic physics, don't get damaged and have insanely fast speed.  Since this title is officially licensed by Ferrari, you drive with 15 original models from the DINO 246 GTS over the F430 to the all-new Enzo Ferrari. The heart of the game is the Coast 2 Coast mode in which you race against up to 5 AI players on 15 US themed tracks. In addition you have to impress different girlfriends. She tells you what she wants to see (a hard slide around a curve or a close take-over for example) and you have to perform it to win her heart.  There are 3 other game modes available in singleplayer: OutRun, Time Attack and OutRun2SP. In OutRun2SP you get access to 15 arcade tracks from the original OutRun 2. In OutRun however you need to drive your girlfriend through various checkpoints to the goal before the timer hits zero. In Time Attack you just have to beat the highscore of the current track. You can either race against the clock or against ghost cars.  In every mode you get OutRun miles after the race. These are the currency of the game and are needed to unlock new cars, upgrades and additional music-stations.  If you feel alone, even with your virtual girlfriend in the car, you can race online against 5 other players.
