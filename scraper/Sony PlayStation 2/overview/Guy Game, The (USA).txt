 An FMV-based trivia game, The Guy Game pits you and up to three other players in a series of rounds in which you must answer multiple-choice trivia questions for top scores. Whether you play alone or with friends, you'll also be playing in the company of a couple of comic relief voiceovers that provide commentary, as well as dozens of co-eds out for spring break, who are more than happy to drop their tops off should they lose the questions. Their naughty bits are obscured by "Guy Game" logos, but depending on how much bonus score you get, you can remove the censoring from the clips and unlock them for uhm... further analysis.  You get bonus points by figuring out if the girls are going to answer right or wrong, what they answer, and also by betting on the outcome of mini-games where the girls compete in races, and assorted beach activities.
