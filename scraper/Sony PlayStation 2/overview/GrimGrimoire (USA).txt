 This game has both the slick, cutesy, story-heavy style that Nippon Ichi has come to be known for as well as moderately deep real-time strategy gameplay.  In GrimGrimoire, the player character is a young magician who has just arrived at her new spellcasting academy only to be the only one to escape its destruction. She travels back in time to relive the past few days and find a way to prevent it. In the lengthy RTS levels, she leads an army of magical beings, each having one of four types which are arranged in a rock-paper-scissors-style system of strengths and weaknesses.
