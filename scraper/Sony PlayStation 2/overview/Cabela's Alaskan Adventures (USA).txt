 Cabela's Alaskan Adventure takes you into the depths of twelve Alaskan regions where hunting, fishing and even dog sledding are supreme. There are two game modes that can be played. In each of the game modes, create a hunter and choose from three difficulty settings. Open Season mode will allow you to quickly hunt or fish in any unlocked area. Adventure mode is the main mode of the game and is the true Alaskan experience. In this mode, travel to each region and visit the outposts to acquire the proper gear including clothing and tents. You will be able to go on hunts, fishing challenges and special contests. Try to unlock new regions, new gear and try to win trophies for prize catches. When hunting, choose from an array of firearms including rifles, shotguns, muzzleloaders, handguns and bows. Grab a pair of binoculars to scan out the area or use a scope for more accurate aiming . Game calls, decoys, scents and lures will also help aid in your hunting experience. Big game animals range from Kodiak Bears and Musk Ox to Barren Ground Caribou and Mountain Goats. Also available to hunt are small game animals such as coyotes, beavers and even birds. Fishing will take you all over Alaska trying to catch Salmon, Arctic Graylings and other Alaskan species. Use the correct bait and lures in the proper areas to make the catch. You can choose from ice fishing, spin fishing and fly fishing with a number of rods and reels to choose from.
