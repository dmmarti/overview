 Romance of the Three Kingdoms VII is the first PlayStation 2 installment of the famous strategy series. Like its predecessors, it is based on the classic novel "San Guo" ("Three Kingdoms"), written by Luo Guanzhong. The events of the novel (and the game) occur during the 3rd century AD, in the time of the Later Han Dynasty. China is split into several states, the leaders of each one trying to conquer the others and to become the sole leader of the Middle Country.   The seventh game of the series offers some innovations - realistic 3D graphics, and the ability to play as any one of the main characters. The game is much more strategy-based than Kessen games, and your success depends on careful planning and training. Combat is turn-based.
