 Virtua Quest is a 3D Action/RPG that features both core RPG elements (exploration, treasure gathering and character development) and a strong fighting component.  The player assumes the identity of a young boy named Sei (pronounced "Say"). As the player explores each stage, he/she will discover "Virtua Souls" data clusters that contain information about the martial arts abilities of the legendary Virtua Fighter characters. These clusters give the player the ability to easily perform complex fighting moves. As the game's story progresses, Sei discovers that only he can unlock the potential of the Virtua Souls, and he subsequently gains the attention of an evil syndicate known as Judgment 6.  Judgment 6, in a mad bid for power, pursues Sei, attempting to force upon him its dirty work in hopes of bringing down the infrastructure of a vast virtual world. If it succeeds, the arbiters of justice and power in the real world will come crumbling down, and anarchy will reign. Sei's inner strength is put to the test as he fights to keep this from happening.
