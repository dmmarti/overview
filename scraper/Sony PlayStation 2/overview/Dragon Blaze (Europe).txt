 Dragon Blaze is a 2D up-scrolling shoot 'em up game where you take control of one of four dragon riders in a fantasy themed setting. The riders are Quaid with his fire dragon, Sonia with her three aqua dragons, Rob with his towheaded thunder dragon and Ian with his skull dragon.  As you make progress through the colorful stages and fight of fantasy teamed enemies weapon power-ups in the form of swords can be retrieved.
