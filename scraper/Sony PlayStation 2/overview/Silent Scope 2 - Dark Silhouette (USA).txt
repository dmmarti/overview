 Pick up your sniper rifle and get ready to take down the terrorists. Story mode takes you through a day in the life of a sniper, out to stop a deadly threat to the President and the rest of the world. Choose from 2 characters, Jackal and Falcon, each with a different angle to each level of the action. Multiplayer mode is also included, using the link cable mode to use two PS2 consoles and 2 TV screens.  However, no sniper rifle peripheral is included.
