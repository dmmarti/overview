 Updated to the 2007 NHL season, the NHL 2K7 ice-hockey game also includes a few changes from NHL 2K6, including an improved camera that gives a better view of the action while still showing the field. This parametric camera is closer down than a typical top-down camera and includes automatic zooming and turning based on the players' position on the ice. Other improvements are the option to shadow opponents to put pressure on them and increase their chance of making a mistake. This is done by holding the left bumper and steering the right control stick towards another player. The amount of pressure can then be determined through taps, with hard tapping inevitably leading to a powerful check.  Aside from that, the game modes from the previous version are identical, as is most of the gameplay and the mini-games included. It has a new rivalry system where statistical bonuses and takeaways are created depending on how players play in games against their rival teams. The main improvements introduced to the Xbox 360 version of the game, such as the "cinematic" presentation system, are not carried over. This is most visible in the graphical area.
