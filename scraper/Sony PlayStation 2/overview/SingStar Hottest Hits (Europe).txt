 SingStar Hottest Hits is a karaoke game, released in Australia, featuring hits songs from recent music charts.  The game gives points which are distributed by the purity of singing, as in how well does one manage to stay on tune. It doesn't matter if you change octaves in the middle of the song or what words are you singing in (it doesn't have a word recognition), so your singing is rated by how well you manage to hit the correct note at the correct time.  Here is the tracklist:  1. Annie - I Know Your Girlfriend Hates Me 2. Avril Lavigne - When You're Gone 3. Calvin Harris - Acceptable In The 80's Colbie Caillat - Bubbly 4.
