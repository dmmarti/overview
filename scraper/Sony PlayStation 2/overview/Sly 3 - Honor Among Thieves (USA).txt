 Sly and the gang is back in this third outing of Sly Raccoon-series.  This time, the story takes the boys (Sly, Bentley and Murray) to the fortress that houses the treasures of Sly's family. Although they are still weary from the adventures in the previous game, they have to get up and face the new threat that could mean the end of Sly's business and the loss of his family heritage. The game itself is a lot like the previous games: Sly sneaks, jumps, and swings himself around the levels, collecting various items, defeating bad guys and ultimately taking on the boss character. The other members of the gang step in on the action once in a while but the Sly centric sections are the main focus of the game. If you like games that had many things to do, this sneak-em-up/platform/action/adventure/puzzle game is for you.
