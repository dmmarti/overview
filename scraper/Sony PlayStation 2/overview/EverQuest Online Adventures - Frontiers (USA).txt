 EverQuest Online Adventures: Frontiers is set in the world of Norrath, 500 years before the PC game EverQuest. It is the standalone second edition of EQOA for the PS2.  Much of the game has improved upon the original design. Included are a new playable race, a new character class, thousands of new items, hundreds of new quests, new musical scores, level advancement to 60, a class mastery system to further customize characters, and 2 additional areas to explore (Odus and Rathe Mountains).  Additionally, the game is continually updated. Some of the additional features since the first edition include unlocking of new zones, an auction system, and lycanthropy character enhancements.
