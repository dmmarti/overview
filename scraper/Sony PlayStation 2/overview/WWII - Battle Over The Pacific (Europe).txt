 This is a World War II themed arcade style flight simulator where you are a pilot fighting for the Allies to control the Pacific. The action takes place seen from a third person perspective. As 'The Free World's Only Hope' (according to the back cover text, which uses those words repeatedly) you'll fight enemy aircraft, tanks and battle ships, as well as bomb enemy installations. You can land on carriers for rearming, repairing and even switching to another aircraft type.
