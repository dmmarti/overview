 The EX series makes its way to the PS2, and has a total of 16 fighters (from past EX games) as well as unlockable fighters like Sagat, M. Bison and many more.  Four game modes, four players, three battle types and a cherry on top. Street Fighter EX3 features the Original, Arena, Character Edit and Training Modes, the first two further configurable to Tag, Dramatic or Team Battle type. In addition, EX3 has a new and more lethal strain of combos that, coupled with Tag capabilities, introduce an element of strategy to the game.
