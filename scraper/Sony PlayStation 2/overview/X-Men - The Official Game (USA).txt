 X-Men: The Official Game acts as a story bridge between the 2nd and 3rd X-Men movies. In the game, you play as Wolverine, Iceman and Nightcrawler as you deal with the aftermath of the incident at Alkali Lake. Each you start the game off by returning to Alkali Lake to recover two stolen Cerebro parts when you uncover a organization that is doing a salvage operation on the base when they uncover something that stands to be a threat to all mutants.  As Wolverine, you fight from a fixed 3rd person view and button mash your way through hordes of soldiers and classic X-Men villains as Sabretooth and Lady Deathstrike. As Iceman, you'll play in a 3rd person flying aerial flying mode where you'll use your ice bridge to fly out and save places such as a nuclear power plant and the Statue of Liberty. As Nightcrawler, you'll play from a free 3rd person perspective and teleport around and use Nightcrawler's teleportation ability to get the drop on your enemies while getting the missing Cerebro parts and saving the Brooklyn Bridge from Mirror Man.
