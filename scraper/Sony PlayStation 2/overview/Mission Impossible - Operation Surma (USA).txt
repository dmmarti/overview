 A stealth-action-adventure game that puts you in a role of Ethan Hunt, with settings based on the movies not the series. However, the story does not follow any of the movies, nor does the main character resemble Tom Cruise, but everything else, from various gadgets and disguising is present. Due to following the story, you will unfold many mysteries behind the ICE Worm virus developed by the Surma Corporation that makes them only one step to global domination, and you as Ethan Hunt, a top-secret government agent will have to prevent that from happening using any means necessary.
