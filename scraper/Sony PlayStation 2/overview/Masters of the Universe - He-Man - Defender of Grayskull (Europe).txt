 Skeletor never managed to defeat He-Man or conquer the land of Eternia in all those cartoon episodes, but he's not the type to so easily give up... or even after failing in so many attempts. H's getting closer to conquer castle Grayskull and if he succeeds, the door to the rest of the Eternia will be left open for him. Once again, He-Man will be put to trial against overwhelming evil force at Skeletor's command, with events taking place through the known settings. As He-Man, you can use various button combinations to create different combos and attacks which will in turn depend on the equipped weapon. And you won't be left alone to deal with the enemies, you'll have your ever-so-loyal companion, the Battle Cat.
