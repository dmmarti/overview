 Wrestling need not be limited to a ring and bare arms. In Backyard Wrestling you can use bricks, tables and anything else found within range - nothing in the environment is statically painted-on. These objects are incorporated into many surprising stunts. The damage modeling includes full blood and gore, which coupled with an intense rock-rap soundtrack ensures that this is not a game for younger players. There are 30 pre-configured wrestlers, and you can create your own to take them on.
