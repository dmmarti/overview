 Dino Stalker is a lightgun game based on the Dino Crisis series.  It is similar in concept to Resident Evil: Survivor in that your character is free to move around the environment rather than being on rails as in most lightgun games.  Players can also play it as a first-person shooter using the standard DualShock 2 controller.  You play a WWII fighter pilot who is teleported out of his plane to a land full of dinosaurs where he must fight to survive and to rescue a young woman.
