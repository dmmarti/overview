 The continent of Atranart is at the verge of doom and destruction.  Monsters appear everywhere and their sole purpose seems to be mayhem and destruction upon all lands.  Player takes control one of four heroes: knight, wizard, priestess or warrior, and then it's time to cleanse the land from evil once again. Very action oriented adventure in the world of magic and heroes is the deal here, and many, many monsters will die and lots of hacking and slashing to be done before the quest is over. The said quest is nine differently themed levels long, each one consisting of several smaller stages in which the player must accomplish a set number of tasks before she can move along to the next one. There is also a multiplayer mode, which is a versus mode game where maximum of four people can take on each other.
