 It is 1960 and the peace and prosperity of Planet Earth is shattered as an aggressive alien species starts a full scale invasion. Their objective â€" the annihilation of the human race!  The signs were there â€" a series of UFO sighting had led to speculation that we were not alone in the universe. But no-one expected the enormity of the threat. Mother ships, troop drop ships and super fast UFOâ€™s seem to be everywhere â€" and we were not prepared.  The first â€" and last â€" line of defense is you and your squadron of 1960â€™s classic aircraft. You have the skills and the weaponry to battle with the UFOâ€™s â€" but the odds are against you as the enemy seems to have a never ending supply of UFOâ€™s. If you can force their ships to land and take control of a UFO you can fly undetected into the hornets nest of the Mother ship itself and turn the tide of war in your favour.  Itâ€™s a simple case of destroy all aliens or be destroyed along with everyone else on the planet!
