 In The Groove is a dancing game similar to the games in the Dance Dance Revolution series. Gameplay involves watching arrows scroll up on top of a music video and the player has to step on the corresponding arrows on the dance mat in time..Performing well will start a combo meter going up, but if the player misses to many the game will end. The unique aspect of the game is arrow modification. Arrows can be modified which can alter the difficulty with things such as no jumps, spinning, or increased speed making things easier or harder for the player.
