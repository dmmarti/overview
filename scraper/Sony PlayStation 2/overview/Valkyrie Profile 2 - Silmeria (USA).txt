 Valkyrie Profile 2: Silmeria is a prequel of the original PlayStation video game Valkyrie Profile and addresses some of unanswered questions in the previous game's storyline.   Several hundred years before the story of the Valkyrie Lenneth, the young and rebellious Valkyrie Silmeria angers the god Odin and becomes imprisoned in the body of Alicia, the princess of Dipan. However, Silmeria manages to retain her consciousness and shares the body with Alicia, leading her father, King Barbarossa, to believe that she is possessed. As a result, he fakes her death and banishes her to a faraway land. When Odin learns of Silmeria's actions, he sends the third valkyrie, Hrist, to find Alicia and to bring Silmeria back to Asgard. In the meantime, Alicia and Silmeria seek the legendary Dragon Orb, an artifact that would allow them to be free from Odin forever.   Although the game retains the side-scrolling aspect of the first Valkyrie Profile while traversing through dungeons or other locations, the second installment is rendered in three-dimensions throughout. The game takes advantage of this during the battle sequences as you must move and position your characters correctly to perform attacks. As in the previous game, Alicia/Silmeria will meet and recruit Einherjar, characters that will assist you in your quest.
