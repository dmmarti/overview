 Crisis Zone for the PlayStation 2 is a port of the arcade game of the same name, and it is a spin-off from the Time Crisis series. In the game you are part of an elite anti-terrorist group called Special Tactical Force and you are sent to fight a terrorist group called U.R.D.A.  The terrorist group has taken over an office center and wants to destroy the nuclear reactor buried deep beneath the complex.  It's up to you, to stop them.  The game play is like the rest of the series, where you are taking cover, trying to eliminate the enemies in a small area before a limited amount of time expires, with the time limit resetting when you finish the area and proceed to the next one. You don't control the player's movement as it is a rail shooter, meaning that your character moves in a pre-determined path, with enemies jumping in the screen to try and damage you. Hide behind your shield to avoid being shot, but you are also not able to shoot while behind it.   The PS2 port can use the G-con 45 and G-Con2 light guns (with the last one being bundled sometimes with the game). Another different of the PS2 port from the arcade one is that the port features an extra mission (Grassmarket District that takes place 6 months after the Garland Square mission in which you have to rescue the daughter of S.T.F. Commander Kessler and clear the district from the remaining terrorists), along with some small minigames.
