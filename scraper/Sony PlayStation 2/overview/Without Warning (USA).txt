 When terrorists invade a chemical plant and the employees are struggling to get out of the plant alive, a Navy SEALs team has come to rescue hostages and trapped employees, as well as killing terrorists and defusing bombs at the plant.  In Without Warning, you play as six different characters with overlapping storylines. Three of these characters are the SEALs that come to the plant. The other characters include a security guard and a secretary at the plant, as well as a news reporter whose chopper was shot down at the plant and wants to get a story of what the heck is going on. Without Warning mixes traditional run-'n-gun elements with puzzles such as unlocking doors and defusing bombs.
