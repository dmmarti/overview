 Heartbeat Boxing is a straightforward 3D boxing game featuring an all-female cast, built off the earlier Boxing Champions from the same developer. The nine characters are divided into three weight classes, and each have the usual array of punches, jabs, and uppercuts, as well as their own unique special moves. Two additional characters, as well as extra costumes, can also be unlocked.  The game features several different modes. There is a single-player Tournament (story) mode, a two-player versus mode, a survival mode, and a practice mode. There is also a View mode where the different outfits and character animations can be freely viewed.
