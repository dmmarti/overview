 This is a direct sequel to "Digital Devil Saga", and the conclusion of its story. In the first game, the tribe leaders of Junkyard, turned into demons, were fighting each other in order to climb the Karma Tower and to escape their grim world, reaching the promised land Nirvana. Serph, the leader of the Embryon tribe and the protagonist of the series, was the victor of their contest. He and his friends have finally reached Nirvana... yet it turned out to be something entirely different from the paradise they have imagined. It appears that the struggle continues in Nirvana itself, and the path to the True World is not yet unlocked...  The sequel utilizes the same gameplay mechanics as the first game. Your party can fight the turn-based battles either in human form, using guns, or as demons. "Digital Devil Saga 2" adds to them a third form, half-demon. Like in the first game, you gain new abilities by buying and learning Mantras. In order to learn them more quickly, you can devour your enemies. Unlike the first game, you can choose freely which Mantra to learn and are not restricted to several pre-determined ways on the Mantra grid field.
