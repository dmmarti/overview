 Odin Sphere is a side-scrolling action game with RPG elements, featuring a combination of 2D and 3D graphics. The game was designed as a spiritual successor to Atlus' own Princess Crown, and features the same kind of modular animation system, allowing for extremely smooth and varied motion for even the largest characters.  The action gameplay is similar to Princess Crown, but does not limit enemy encounters to one-on-one fights, instead, all fighting happens in real-time as the player progresses through circular areas. Upon defeating enemies, the player is rewarded with items and experience in order to level up the attack strength and magic capabilities of the character. Players can also plant seeds during combat that will grow as they absorb Phozons released by defeated enemies, eventually producing edible fruit. Phozons can also be absorbed by the character to power up their weapon.   The game features 5 distinct playable characters, each with his or her own storyline intertwined into one epic tale loosely based on Richard Wagner's Der Ring des Nibelungen.
