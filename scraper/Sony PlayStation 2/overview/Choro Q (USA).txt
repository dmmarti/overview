 ChoroQ has been described by many people as a "CarPG" in that while you do partake in tons of arcadeish races against other super deformed cars (called ChoroQs in the game), you also drive around three different towns, talking to the ChoroQs and doing quests and mini games.  There's over 200 different body styles to unlock through the story mode (very few of them actually change the way your ChoroQ handles or performs; they're largely for show) and a wide range of parts you can buy to upgrade your car (either for performance or for looks).  The game supports two player split screen where you can import your ChoroQs from your own individual adventures and battle each other and also compete against each other in a wide range of minigames.
