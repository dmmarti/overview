 FIFA Soccer 12 is a soccer game in which the player directly controls the athletes. As always, the game offers an extensive license package which allows the player to take control over a real-life team in a real-life championship. However, the career mode is the heart of the game: During up to 15 seasons the player brings his club to the top; either as manager, a single athlete or coach. Every role brings a different set of jobs and challenges to fulfill. The most notable changes in comparison to FIFA 11 (console version) include a new physics engine, a new defending system and the so-called "Pro Player Intelligence" which means athletes are aware of the skills of their athletes and base their decisions on that.
