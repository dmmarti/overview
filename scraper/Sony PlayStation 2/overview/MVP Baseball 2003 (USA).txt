 MVP is EA Sports' replacement for the aging Triple Play series.  Re-written from the ground up, this rookie title includes a Homerun Showdown (not a derby - something a little different) and Franchise mode as well as the usual exhibition games.  Many custom batting and pitching animations as well as vendors hawking hot-dogs and hecklers shouting player and team specific heckles - all in an effort to submerse you in the game.
