 Picking up where 2006's game left off, NBA '07 hits the hardwood with new features, enhanced gameplay, and a return to the immersive inside experience of life in the league by introducing "The Life: Volume 2." An all-new Smart Shot Indicator provides a visual gauge of the impact defense has on shot opportunities, and a new Power Boarding System is now in place to offer a true 3D approach for players to position themselves for rebounds. Officially licensed by the NBA, more than a dozen mini-games are available in NBA â€™07 including favorites such as 21, Own the Court, and 3-Point Shootout. Also featured is online access to compete in a variety of leagues and tournaments, EyeToy functionality, and an all-new soundtrack.
