 Moorhuhn returns with a complete redesign in 3D in this sequel to previous titles of the Moorhuhn shooter series. Instead of simply flying and running around, the chickens feature a lot of animated motion sequences that make them seem almost alive. The surroundings are completely generated in 3D and feature a lot of crazy objects and scenes such as two hedgehogs playing cards (one is actually wearing dark sunglasses!). The chickens try to hide in every conceivable place on screen, be it an old oven or in an outdoor toilet. They hide in wheat fields and even dress up as a sunflower in order to escape the player's dreadful gun. All these features make it more difficult for the player to get all the chickens. The actual shooting controls remain the same as in previous Moorhuhn games: the player aims with the mouse, shoots by clicking the left mouse button and reloads by clicking the right mouse button.
