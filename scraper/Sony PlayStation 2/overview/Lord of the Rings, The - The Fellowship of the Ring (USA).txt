 Based on the legendary novels by the late JRR Tolkien, you take control of the Fellowship as they follow a path of evil to the steps of Mount Doom, in order to cast the One ring of Sauron back into the depths of the volcano, in turn destroying the evil that lies within it. This first in a trilogy follows Frodo and the fellowship as they begin their journey to Mount Doom, only to find that what lies ahead may be too much to handle.  The Xbox version, a 3rd person adventure, has you scaling the lands of middle earth in real time combat with a host of evil creatures to find your way past. Along the way, you will come across familiar characters that will aid or hinder your progress.  Unlike the movie trilogy, this adaption of the tale includes characters not seen on the big screen, including Tom Bombadil and others, as well as including many of the songs written by Tolkien as puzzles.
