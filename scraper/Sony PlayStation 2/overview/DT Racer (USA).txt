 DT Racer is an arcade and simulation racer featuring 21 facsimiles of real race cars. Players can select from Arcade, GT, and Free modes. In Arcade the player progresses through increasingly more difficult grand prix to unlock more powerful tiers of cars. In GT mode players are awarded credits for finishing races that they can buy new cars with, and higher level races require higher tier cars to be played. Courses range from ovals to city courses, and include facsimiles of real tracks such as the Circuit de Monaco.  Before a race the tires, downforce, and suspension of a car can be modified. During a race cars take damage from impacts, causing parts to break and fall off the car. This damage will also hinder a car's performance.
