 Based on the movie of the same name, The Tale of Despereaux stars Despereaux, the mouse with the big ears, who is not afraid of anything. When the human Princess Pea is  kidnapped, Despereaux goes to the rescue.  Gameplay is the standard 3rd-person platforming and combat, with a focus on mouse-like agility. You can buy extra combat moves from the swash-buckling Caravaggio using cheese pieces or shiny buttons you find.
