 In an ancient time long past, a young man travels to the ends of the Earth, a place that is said to be forbidden to enter.  He carries a young woman, who died from a terrible curse.  He seeks the Dormin, a strange and God-like being that resides there.  The Dormin is surprised that the man carries an ancient and magical sword, and speaks to the man.  The man pleas for his help in bringing back the woman's cursed soul, however the being says it is the law of mortals that a dead soul cannot be brought back.  He does say though, that if the man is willing to accept some heavy consequences, that there might be a way to revive her.  But it will not be easy.    Our hero must embark on a quest to slay 16 colossi, giant creatures that tower hundreds of feet above the Earth.  Using his ancient sword and his horse Agro, he must travel across the immense landscape seeking the colossi to save his love.  Taking the form of various animals and other bipedal creatures, these colossi are tough and fierce.  Their skin is tougher than leather, and the armor they wear is literally rock.  However, by using his ancient sword, the man can penetrate the weak spot on them and destroy the towering beings and free his love's soul.  Shadow of the Colossus is set in the same universe as ICO, by the same development studio, and it is a prequel to the game.
