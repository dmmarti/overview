 Based on the cartoon series rather the comic books or the movies, Batman: Vengeance puts you in the role of the 'Dark Knight' in a 3D Gotham City, in order to face and fight enemies; such as Mr. Freeze, Poison Ivy, Harley Quinn, and, yes, The Joker.  The Joker has died after falling from a bridge mid-scuffle with our caped hero. With the big man's place at the top of the criminal hierarchy up for grabs, the city's most heinous villains are out in force, clambering over each other for the new employment opportunity. Batman's most dangerous opponents are causing a crime wave the likes of which Gotham has never seen. Nothing is as it seems. You can't even be sure that the infamous Joker has really ceased to exist. Gotham's safety hangs in the balance and only Batman can save it.
