 You play the role of Kyle Travers, an underground pit fighter and brother of Cody Travers from the original Fight Fight series. The game takes place as Kyle searches for his brother. Kyle, now a released convict has got caught up in problems. The game itself is non-linear and is a 3D Beat-em Up. Haggar is in the game also. The setting is modern day Metro City. Unlike the previous games you can interact with NPCs and there are side missions which allow you to earn new moves. Like the previous games you can pick up various objects like pool cues, shotguns, and lead pipes. An all-new combo system has been incorporated as well.
