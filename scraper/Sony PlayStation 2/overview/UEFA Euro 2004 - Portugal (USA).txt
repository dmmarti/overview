 As a tie-in with the European soccer championship, held in Portugal on June 2004, EA Canada created this spin-off of the FIFA Soccer series. With a full license, players can choose any from the 51 nations and duke it out in friendly matches, or follow the path to the championship's final through the qualifying stages, group stages and eventually the play-off. You can also create your own dream team with players from different nations.  Other highlights includes a new bag of tricks, different weather types, a system to track injuries and suspensions and a dynamic morale system that fluctuates based on individual and team performances. There are also TV-style replays, crowd chants, national anthems and trophy celebrations.
