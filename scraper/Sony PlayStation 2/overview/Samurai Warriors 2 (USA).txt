 Samurai Warriors 2 is a game made by Omega Force and published by KOEI, the same developer and publisher of the famous Shin Sangoku Musou (Dynasty Warriors) series. As with the original Samurai Warriors, Samurai Warriors 2 is based on the Japanese Sengoku or "Warring States" period, a time of social upheaval, political intrigue, and nearly constant military conflict in Japan that lasted roughly from the middle of the 15th century to the beginning of the 17th century.  The game is a third person hack-and-slash. You have 26 playable characters to choose from. Once you choose your character you are tossed into massive real-time battles, with the object being to help claim victory for your army by defeating key enemy officers, or simply slaying a large amount of enemy troops, which will boost the morale of your army, and turn the tides of the battle.   10 new warriors are added from the previous game including the legendary Musashi Miyamoto, the unifier of Japan Ieyasu Tokugawa, and the enigmatic ninja Kotaro Fuma. Each warrior has his own unique move set and techniques. Set traps, summon ninja decoys, and more. Use powerful Linked Charge attacks and power up to three Musou gauges. Now castle warfare blends seamlessly with field combat. Take control of castles on the battlefield to gain a significant morale advantage. There are multiple game modes including Story, Free, and Survival modes. Team up with friends for two-player Co-op play or compete with them at "Sugoroku," a bonus party game for up to four players.
