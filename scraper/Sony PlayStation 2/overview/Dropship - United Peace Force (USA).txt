 Dropship is an action game set in the year 2050. Terrorist attacks have increased severely, which is why big nations of the world decided to form the UPF, "United Peace Force", replacing the UN and NATO. It is an anti-terror army, operating world-wide.  But there is another globally operating group: A massively militarised drug syndicate. When an attack on a peace convoy in Columbia is linked to this cartel, the UPF starts investigation. A central base and training camp of the drug cartel is believed to be located somewhere in Libya. The UPF opens up a base in this country and starts looking for the criminals.  The player is a recently recruited soldier and pilot of the UPF. During the campaign, which lasts for 20 rather long missions, he can travel and fight on foot, in tanks and various other ground vehicles, but most of the time he will be piloting a dropship, either of the attack, defender or transport class. Dropships can operate in hover and flight mode, and carry a large amount of weapons and cargo.  Dropship simulates a massive, global conflict, with the player taking part in all the action. Six training missions make it easier to learn the controls of the game.
