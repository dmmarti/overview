 Splashdown puts you in the role of one of nine "over the top" jetskiiers, and challenges you to race on a plethora of courses.  Most courses take place in lakes and rivers, all modified to include jumps.  Certain courses are man-made and built in a stadium, where you race one-on-one around a square or oval-shaped track.  Tracks take place in different areas of the world, from Florida to Italy.  Each character has a different seadoo, that has it's own unique characteristics, such as handling, speed and acceleration.  Each seadoo has been licensed by the SEA-DOO company, so each machine is accurate in looks and ability.  Each rider can perform a number of different stunts, such as the Superman, the Can-Can, and the Lazyboy.  There is one special stunt that is different for each racer.  Multiplayer options include a "trick attack" and the standard race.
