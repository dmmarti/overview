 Sequel to BloodRayne, BloodRayne 2 follows Rayne into the modern day. No longer killing Nazis, she teams up again with the Brimstone Society to take out her Vampire Father and her various siblings. Rayne's new powers and abilities include rail sliding (among other acrobatics), blood guns, stop time, and tons of gruesome fatalities to dispatch her foes with.
