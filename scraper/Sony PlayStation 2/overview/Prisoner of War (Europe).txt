 It is World War II, and the player takes the role of an American pilot, Captain Lewis Stone, who is thrown into a prison camp of the Nazis. While attempting to escape the camp, Captain Stone discovers that the Germans are developing a secret weapon they intend to use against the Allies. Soon his personal wish of escape turns into a desire to save the world from the destruction the Nazis are planning.  Prisoner of War can be described as a stealth game. Unlike most other games of its kind (e.g. the Thief series), the game relies on stealth entirely, without offering violent options. The protagonist is helpless in the prison camp, and his only weapon is his wit. Sneaking past guards to deliver an important object to a fellow prisoner, hiding items, staying in shadows to avoid being recognized, and other stealth-based activities occupy the largest portion of the game.
