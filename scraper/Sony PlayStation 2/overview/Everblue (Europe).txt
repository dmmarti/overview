 The player takes the role of Leonardo, a young novice scuba diver. In the process of exploring the Daedalus sea for treasure you will also find the chance to learn about a mysterious treasure that has haunted your family for generations and in the process perhaps alter the fate of the Daedalus sea. Along the way you will meet a cast of varied characters from who you can perform missions in order to advance both the main story and side plots.  You explore the ocean in first person using radar to find valuables. This radar works by bleeping faster and faster until you are directly on your target. Apart from open ocean you enter sunken ships and even old submerged temples. By collecting these items as well as selling them you can improve your gear and bring your underwater exploration to new levels. You are given both HP and Air meters as you travel under water if if your Air runs out your HP will go down and the end is sure to follow. The game also features a weight system where each object you pick up has a weight assigned, if you become too burdened you will not be able to move.  The land sections are presented in a in a pre-rendered environment with a point-and-click interface.
