 Evolution GT is a simulation-racing game that gives the player the opportunity to experience the life of a real racing driver throughout the course of his career. By choosing appropriate race tactics and driving styles, the player will grow in his ability to compete at an ever-higher level, gaining access to new racing cars as well as roadsters, coup√®s and eventually dream cars. Races take place across Europe; from the beautiful landscapes of the Scottish Highlands and the Cote d'Azur to London and Barcelona, without missing out on historic racing venues such as Laguna Seca or Hockenheim.
