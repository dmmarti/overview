 Live the life of Hugh Hefner in this "Virtual Hef" simulation.  As a young Hugh Hefner, it is the player's goal to build the Playboy empire through sexy parties and putting together Playboy magazine every month. Build friendships and business contacts with celebrities, political figures, musicians, sports stars and more through hosting events and charming over people.    On the business side, Hef has to hire a staff to take photos and write articles for the magazine. The "Playboy Photoshoot" mode allows the player to take the role of photographer. On the personal side, invite friends into your inner circle, and find a girlfriend... or two.... or more. The better the parties Hef throws, the more fame he gets, as well as more interesting people to fill the magazine. More money means a larger staff, and more items (toys and furniture) for Hef to display in the Mansion.  Doing well in the game earns Hef points which can be used to purchase extra features, such as cheats and archive photos of Hef and past issue covers.
