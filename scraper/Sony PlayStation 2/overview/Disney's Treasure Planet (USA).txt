 Treasure Planet is the adaptation of an animated Disney movie.  The game follows the adventures of Jim Hawkins, a young boy on a quest to locate a mythical planet called Treasure Planet. To find the planet he needs to travel to many locations throughout the universe and complete tasks before he finds the ultimate prize.  The tasks range from finding a certain number of items to catching runaway animals to flipping a series of switches. Completing the tasks lights a beacon, and when a set number of these beacons are lit, the next level is then available.   Jim is also able to ask for help from his "pet," Morph, to get him past areas that pose a challenge.  Morph can change his shape into a helpful item like giant robotic arms or a jetpack.  Another adaptation from the movie is solar surfing. During the surfing missions Jim pilots a futuristic surfboard to complete the mission objectives.
