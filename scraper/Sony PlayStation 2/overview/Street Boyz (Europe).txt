 Gouki, the leader of the Hell Black Heaven gang, has a wicked scheme going down: Operation Gang Snatch. He plans to get all the other gang leaders in the area locked away in jail, so his own boys can take over the whole city! But Jin and his friend Ginji are having none of that, and they've busted straight back out of jail and are ready to bust some skulls and hunt down Gouki to exact the punishment he deserves.  Street Boyz is a third-person beat-'em-up in the tradition of River City Ransom. The player controls Jin as he runs about the city beating up rival gang members. He can find and purchase a variety of items and weaponry, as well as grab objects off the ground and use them as improvised instruments of chaos. Between stages, the player can also move around an overworld map to visit shops and speak with other characters to glean information.
