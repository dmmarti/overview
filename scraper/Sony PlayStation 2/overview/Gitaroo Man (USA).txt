 In this strange music rhythm game, you play Gitaroo-Man as you go against various music themed villains.  The game puts a new twist on music games as you not only have to time button presses but you have to move the analog stick around in a radar circle to follow a line that passes through the center point.  You can play up to 4 players using the multitap and choose from a variety of characters, songs, and locales.
