 Just like the other Xtreme expansions in the Dynasty Warriors franchise, Dynasty Warriors 4: Xtreme Legends adds more weapons, items, and modes into the mix. Choose one of the 42 characters from the original Dynasty Warriors 4 and raise a body count of several thousand soldiers. The game can be played in conjunction with Dynasty Warriors 4, adding new features to the original game, or it can be played through new levels custom-made for each general.  The graphics are slightly improved, there are two new difficulty levels (Beginner and Chaos), and three new game modes: Xtreme, Arena Challenge and Legend. Xtreme offers randomly generated skirmishes. Players can earn points and buy new items. Arena Challenge focuses on one-on-one duals while Legend focuses on the strengths and weaknesses of the individual warriors in 42 stages. To play external modes with the new content, the original disc is required. Save data is compatible between the two games.
