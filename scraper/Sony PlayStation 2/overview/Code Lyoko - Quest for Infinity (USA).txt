 Code Lyoko: Quest for Infinity is the second game based off of the popular French animated TV series Code Lyoko and it is presented as a 3D action platformer. It continues the original premise of the four high school students who discover a computer in an abandoned factory, holding a large virtual world plagued by the virus X.A.N.A., but many of the characters' backgrounds are taken from later seasons in the series.  Players take the role of one of the four heroes from the show, Ulrich, Odd, Yumi or Aelita, and fight across the virtual environment of Lyoko and the internet against the dangerous virus X.A.N.A. and his army of monsters. Levels are accessed from a main hub and players can switch between any of the characters at any time, but they share health and energy. The characters' various weapons and abilities can be used to take them out, like Ulrich's swords, Odd's laser arrows or the ability to climb walls, or Yumi being the only one who can balance on thin ledges. Many of these skills are unlocked during the course of the game. X.A.N.A. on the Internet can be hunted down using the digital submarine Skidbladnir.
