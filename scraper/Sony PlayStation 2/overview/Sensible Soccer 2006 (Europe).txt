 After many years of silence, Sensible Soccer has returned. As with the original 1992 game, Sensible Soccer 2006 is a fast-paced football game viewed from a bird's perspective (although the camera has been slightly tilted). The control has gone from one button to three buttons, as you use one for shooting, another for passing and the third for sprinting. In addition to that you use the stick on gamepads to aim and to apply the famous after-touch.  The game contains a total of around 350 different teams (international and club teams) and 50 preset competitions. If that is not enough, players can create their own custom teams. This is the career mode of the game. The objective is to create a squad of rookie players and take them to the top of the team rankings. As you succeed you will earn skill points that can be used to increase the quality of your team.  Sensible Soccer 2006 offers multiplayer matches (no online play though) for up to four players at once (in which two players share the control of a team). Another feature left from the original game is the possibility for players to create their own competitions - leagues, cups and tournaments.
