 DNA immerses you in a futuristic world where geneticists have perfected human genome technology. Scientists have the ability to alter a human's genetic code to create a near perfect human being. You play as a man who happens to be the subject of an important genome experiment. You've been implanted with nano-technology, and as a result you possess physical abilities that surpass those of normal humans. The nano-technology also lets you create an infinite number of bombs with your right hand, and your left hand has slots where you can plug in different biochips--special chips that endow you with new abilities and knowledge. As the game begins, you wake from a near coma state with no memory--your objective is to find out your identity by infiltrating the laboratory of a secret organization known as Stray Sheep.
