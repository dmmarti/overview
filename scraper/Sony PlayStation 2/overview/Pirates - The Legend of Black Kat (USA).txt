 Another one of those swashbuckling 'Ship ahoy!' games on the horizon, only this time you're a she captain. Yup that's right, you play fearless and twice more gorgeous Katarina de Leon. Raised only by her father, since her mother died when she was little girl, she grew independent and inherited a touch for sailing and adventuring. She'll need to face many foes on her mysterious journey, navigate boats, ships and galleons, be quick on the sword edge, and still stay in command. This may as well be resurrection of the famous "Pirates!" with the foes that vary from mythological creatures and beasts, to skeletons and simply rogues. This is a test for all of ya pirates out there, both to prove yourself in adventuring and the strategy.
