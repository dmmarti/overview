 Based upon the successful television series The X-Files, Resist or Serve acts as 3 new episodes in the show's 7th season. The game features music from the series as well as voice acting by the show's stars.  As is routine for the team of paranormal investigators, Fox Mulder and Dana Scully travel to a small town in the Rocky Mountains to dig into the source of some strange and unexplained murders. The two prime suspects are girls accused of practicing witchcraft, but Mulder believes there's more to the story. Each episode has two acts, and takes players from secret facilities, to FBI headquarters, to a remote location in Siberia in search of the truth.  Gameplay is similar to the Resident Evil series. A fixed camera tracks the player and changes angles at specified points in the room. Control is similar, and players lock on to enemies to fire, and cannot move while shooting. Each episode can be played as either Mulder or Scully, with a few different locations and challenges (such as autopsies and puzzles for Scully) for each side of the story.  Bonus content includes brief videos of the dialogue recordings and concept art for the game.
