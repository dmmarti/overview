 In this fifth and portable installment to the Syphon Filter series, you play multiple characters, including Gabe Logan, all who are agents of Precision Strike, a government agency.  In the game's single player story mode, standard Rambo tactics won't work.  You must use stealth combined with state of the art weapons and melee combat to help uncover a deadly threat to global security, the Dark Mirror project.  The game also allows you to replay all missions for special bonus material.  The game's online multiplayer mode allows for four different games modes including team and free-for-all deathmatches and two different co-op games.
