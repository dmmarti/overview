 Counter Terrorist Special Force is an action game in which you are a part of an anti-terrorist force whose sole purpose is to strike where striking is needed and put end to evil plans to destroy/take over the world.  The player controls two different heroes. Night Owl is an infiltrations expert, and very good at accurate shooting and jumping from planes, which some of the missions require him to do. Raptor on the other hand, is a weapons expert. He is also more than adequate in hand-to-hand combat. These two take turns in their own levels on their way to destroy the evil NEMESIS group and retrieve the stolen scientific plans.  Levels are always very action-oriented even when playing as Night Owl and there are very little sneaking to do, as the main focus is on action. The levels range from your basic submarine factories to hidden missile silos and so on, with a few outdoor levels here and there, in which one usually can drive one of the vehicles (jeeps, hovercrafts, boats, etc).  There are multiple weapons to choose from. From knives to huge rocket launchers and solid turrets. The physics system is also implemented in the game and most of the time there is a nice amount of stuff and dudes flying around as you make havoc with havok.
