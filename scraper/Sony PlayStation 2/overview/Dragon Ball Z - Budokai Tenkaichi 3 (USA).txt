 Budokai Tenkaichi 3 is a 1vs1 fighting game based on the anime/manga Dragon Ball by Akira Toriyama. It includes the apocalyptic battles and the essence of the Dragon Ball series following the main story of the popular manga. As in the previous games of the series, you'll have to select your character (over 162 characters with their own movements and combos) and fight against a friend or the computer in many different game modes with many different stages and weather/time conditions.  Budokai Tenkaichi 3 is the third game of the Budokai Tenkaichi series and features some new things like new characters, Battle Replay to capture your fights and save them to a SD card, night and day stages for more accurate battles following the history made by Akira Toriyama and a Disc Fusion to unlock new modes with the need of previously released games Budokai Tenkaichi and Budokai Tenkaichi 2. There are also new combos and movements as well as the possibility to take control of the Giant Apes for the Saiyans.
