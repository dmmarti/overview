 This is a game where you have to use your sense of rhythm to pass the levels with 85 different songs.  You walk around on a little stage with your character. As the music plays, markers pop up on the stage that expand in sync with the music. You have to hit those markers at the right time. This will trigger an instrument or jingle of the music (and give you points). Each characters has special abilities - some of them for example can move the markers to get them closer (or out of reach of the opponents). All characters can use a pitch-bend to change the tone of a triggered jingle for extra fun.  Apart from having several game modes, you can also play this game solo or with a friend, either cooperative or in a battle mode to see who's got a better sense of rhythm.
