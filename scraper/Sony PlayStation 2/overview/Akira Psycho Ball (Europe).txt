 Akira Psycho Ball is a pinball game based on the animated movie Akira (1988). The focus of the game is the story mode during which the player visits four stages (Neo-Tokyo, Laboratory, A-Room and Olympic Stadium) which are also divided into different tables. On each table, the player has to reach special objectives with the usual pinball mechanics, e.g. hitting certain things in the correct order. There are also optional secret rooms to find. After finishing all objectives, the next table is unlocked as well as a cutscene directly taken from the movie.  The arcade mode is unlocked after finishing the story and allows the player to freely play the tables for highscores. The vs. mode (either against the AI or another human) is played on two tables which are divided in the middle, but are interconnected through a loop at the top. The main goal is to send as many balls as possible to the opponent's side because each lost ball gives a penalty point. The first player to reach a certain number loses the match.
