 This installment of the Smackdown series continues the "Smackdown vs Raw" era of the series, which now uses a yearly date in the title, like other sports titles.  This time, the game boasts an updated roster of your favorite wrestlers, as well as many classic superstars like Bret Hart or British Bulldog. It also includes many new arenas from recent Pay-Per-Views, as well as a classic arena from Wrestlemania 9. All new recorder dialogue for many of the wrestlers helps bring the storylines to life as you go through many different plots on Season Mode as you chase the championship belts.  Gameplay is slightly improved, with a larger list of moves available to each wrestler, and pre-match mini-games to start your fight off with and determine who has the upper hand.  Another new addition is General Manager Mode, where you take the role of GM and try to book your weekly show. Taking into account costs to contract wrestlers, keeping your wrestler happy and healthy, and putting on matches and setting up feuds to keep the ratings for your show high.  All of this culminates in earning Smackdown Dollars, which you can use to buy new moves, new create-a-wrestler items, Legends wrestlers, and even furniture to customize your own locker room. You can also earn trophies for your trophy case by completing challenges and beating GM Mode.
