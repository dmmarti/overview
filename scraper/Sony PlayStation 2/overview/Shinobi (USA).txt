 Gamers waited many years for another installment of the Shinobi series.  Now they finally get what they have wanted.  Shinobi takes place in Tokyo, where a mysterious evil force has taken over, and it is up to you to stop it.  You play Hotsuma, who is the leader of a clan called the Obura Clan.  Hotsuma is the only survivor of his clan, though, and all of his dead clansmen are now fighting against him.  The game has eight levels, each of them broken into two sections, and with bosses along the way.  The control scheme allows you to dash, attack, jump and throw shurikons.  A lock-on feature is also provided.  The main objectives of the levels is to kill.  No item fetching or switch pushing is required.  Shinobi also contains combo features, where lots of enemies can be killed in one encounter.
