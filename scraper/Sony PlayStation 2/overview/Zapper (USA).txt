 In the game you are a cricket named Zapper on a mission to save your brother. You have to pass through six interactive worlds during 20 levels, each with dangerous hazards you must avoid, eggs you must capture, meeting both friends and enemies that help and hinder your progress to a diabolical nest-building magpie named Maggie. Zapper can move in four directions, climb vertical surfaces like trees and walls, and zap opponents with his electric antennae.
