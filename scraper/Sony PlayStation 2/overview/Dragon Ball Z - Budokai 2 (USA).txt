 This is the second installment of the Budokai series. Goku and the Z Warriors travel through the Dragonball Z universe from the Saiyan to the Kid Buu Saga. It has all new cel-shaded characters with absorptions and fusions. Instead of story mode, they have Dragon World, where you can create your own Dragonball Z adventure!
