 Underworld: The Eternal War is based on the movie of the same name. The storyline revolves around the eternal war between the vampires and werewolves, and as the player, you can choose the side you're teaming with. You can either choose the movie's heroine Selene, or can be the "bad guy" Raze, who is a werewolf.  It's an all out slugfest as you take on to the battlefields where you must accomplish missions, were they about protecting someone, kill someone, get an item from somewhere, or just kill everyone.  The action is the name of the game here and there are lots of it. Using different weapons, you smack the opposition to kingdom come. Many, many times. After that, it's more smacking. And then some.
