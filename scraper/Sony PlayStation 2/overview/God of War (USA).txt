 God of War is set in the age of ancient Greek myths. The hero of the game is a mortal warrior Kratos. Long time ago, Kratos was the leader of Spartans, a fearless and brutal general who waged wars for the glory of his city. Today, he is known as the Ghost of Sparta. For the past ten years, he is tormented with terrible nightmares, unable to forget the tragedy that happened in his past. He has to serve the gods of Olympus, who promised to forgive his sins if he becomes their champion. Finally, the goddess Athene tells Kratos that redemption will be granted to him if he defeats her brother, the god of war Ares, who was the very reason for the tragic event of his past...  Kratos has two default swords that he will always carry with him called the Blades of Chaos.  They allow you to perform combos, which will constantly climb until you can no longer fight (you've killed everyone in the area), or you take too long to register another hit.  The higher your combo total, the more red orbs you get from defeated enemies.  Similar to Devil May Cry, the red orbs you collect from fallen enemies can be used to purchase upgrades.  You can upgrade your default weapons, so that you can learn new moves and strike faster, or you can put the orbs into different weapons acquired throughout the game, such as Blade of Artemis.  Kratos will, over time, also have access to a selection of magic spells.  At specific points in the game, you will be able to generate an arc of electricity, courtesy of Zeus, or you will be able to use the decapitated head of a Gorgon to turn enemies into stone, using Meduza's Gaze.  God of War features several unlockable extras, which are only acquired when you beat the game on the different difficulty modes.  Most of the features are a behind-the-scenes look at various aspects of the game, such as creating the world, modeling Kratos, and a look at deleted levels that didn't make the final cut of the game.
