 King of Clubs is a crazy golf game set in Big Bubba’s run down theme park in the middle of the Nevada desert.  It features 96 holes, set in 5 different environment themes.  Each environment theme has its own resident ‘Course Pro’ resplendent in suitably themed fancy dress costume.  There are 4 single player modes (Career, Tournament, Speed Golf, Practice).  As you progress through the game, you’ll unlock special balls and clubs which enable you to play different types of shots (e.g. chip clubs, swerve clubs, rubber balls, speed balls).  Combinations of these balls and clubs then allow you to approach holes in different ways and attempt various trick shots to try and get a hole in one (which is possible on every hole).  In multi-player, you can play against up to 3 friends.  The multi-player game features specific pickups which can help you and hinder your opponents as well as a ‘distraction’ feature which allows non-active players to trigger sound effects and rumble the pad of the player currently taking a shot.  The game also features a ‘Pro-Shop’ where buy various gadgets to customise various elements of the game such as the colour of your ball, its trail and even the sound effects it makes when you hit it.
