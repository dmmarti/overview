 Based on the events of Star Wars Episode 1: The Phantom Menace, there are three main characters: Rhys Dallows, Vana Sage, and Nym, each with their own perspectives on the events surrounding the battle for Naboo. Each character has their own ships for you to fly, with both positives and negatives attached, but either way you must stop the Trade Federation and their plans to destroy the peaceful planet.
