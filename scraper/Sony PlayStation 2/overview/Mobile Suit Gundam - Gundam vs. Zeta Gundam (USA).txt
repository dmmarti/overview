 In this version of the Mobile Suit Gundam series, a war as taken place between the The Titans and a splinter group of the Earth Federation called the A.E.U.G.  Several years after the One Year War, the A.E.U.G. is formed from a group of disillusioned members of the Earth Federation and is now waging war against the Titans and it is up to the remaining members of the EF to team up with the Titans to stop this menace.  The story revolves around a Gundam pilot named Kamille Bidan, who pilots the game's namesake the Zeta Gundam, but the player can also choose which side they want to fight for, either the Titans/Federation or the A.E.U.G.  The gameplay mostly consists of traversing landscapes and destroying enemy mechs and completing objectives.  The mechs can also convert into secondary vehicles such as jets with more powerful weapons as well.
