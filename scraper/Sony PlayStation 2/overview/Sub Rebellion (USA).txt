 Sub Rebellion is a mission based submarine shooter game where the player controls a sub whose mission is to defend the remnants of the free world. The action takes places 15 years after a cataclysmic event that causes planet-wide earthquakes which destroy most of human civilization. What remains of humanity now lives in the depths of the oceans, where an evil military-industrial complex seeks total control.  The Alliance rises to defend humanity from this foe; the player is tasked with controlling the Chronos, the Alliance's newest sub, through various missions starting with the maiden voyage. While most of the game takes place underwater, there is also some sea-level fighting, including a number of boss fights.  The submarine controls are complex and it has the ability to rapidly ascend or descend, manoeuvres which are essential in combat. The Chronos uses a variety of weapons - cannons, torpedoes and special weapons - and equipment which can be upgraded throughout the game by completing missions and collecting artifacts.
