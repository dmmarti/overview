 In this RPG-lite version of ChoroQ, you drive a car to various towns.  In each town you can talk to other cars, complete quests, race, compete in mini-games such as car golf, car soccer, and car roulette, and upgrade your car with hundreds of different parts.  You can also collect photos of scenic locations, collect coins scattered around the terrain, and collect stamps for completing various tasks.
