 MLB 2004 is the game of baseball brought home.  This game strives for realism with "total control" batting, pitching, and fielding, as well as having every player's head accurately recreated with the use of a 3D scanner.  In addition to returning modes such as season play and home run derby, new in this year's edition of the game are career, spring training, and franchise modes.  In spring training mode, you not only create a player, but also must earn your way onto the team by performing well in spring training.
