 In this newest 3D Indiana Jones adventure, the famed archaeologist finds himself once again searching for "fortune and glory" by seeking the fabled Staff of Kings, the staff that Moses used to part the Red Sea.  Set in 1939, Indy's adventures take him across the globe through areas such as San Francisco, Istanbul, Odin and Panama, and he races against time to find the religious artifact before the Nazis do.  The game features highly interactive backgrounds (called "Hot Sets") that allow Indiana Jones to utilize a large number of items and environments that are used to subdue his foes.  In addition to his whip, Indy can use his revolver to take out foes in an arcade style shooting mode, and ride vehicles or animals in certain action sequences.  Quick Time Events also make up certain action and chase moments, requiring quick timing to get through perilous situations.  Multi-player modes are also available, allowing players to re-enact scenes from the movies, or battle against each other.  While the game is the same for all platforms, the Wii version. uses motion controls to simulate Indy's fists, whip, and gun.  In addition the Wii includes an exclusive emulation of the classic PC title Indiana Jones and the Fate of Atlantis.
