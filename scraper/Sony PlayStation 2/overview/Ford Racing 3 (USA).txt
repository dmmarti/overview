 Ford Racing 3 is the sequel to Ford Racing 2.  Now there are 55 Ford models available (Ford GTs, Thunderbirds, concepts, SVT vehicles, Mustangs and Tucks) and you unlock them as you win the races.  Twenty six tracks are available, including road, off-road and oval ones, in different environments (snow, mud, water, mountain trails, beach, race tracks and more).  It has 2 play modes: Ford Competition and Ford Challenge. In Ford Competition you run 14 thematic cups. In Ford Challenge, you run single races in different game modes: boost, relay, overtake, elimination, duel, drafting, driver skills, seconds out, race line and time attack. As you win the races, you collect Ford cars, tracks and race types.  The multiplayer mode ables you to play via LAN (only for PC) and split screen mode (on PS2 and Xbox).
