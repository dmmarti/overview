 Sgt. J. Keller is a Black Op and he has just failed his operation - badly.  He has been incarcerated and is interrogated to reveal his mission and to find out what went wrong.  The player goes through Keller's failed operation in eight areas, wasting enemy soldiers and trying to stay alive.  There are primary and secondary objectives, such as reaching a rendezvous point and gathering intel.  Black is a classic first-person shooter with variety of weapons and interactive scenery - interactive meaning destructible in this case.  Enemy soldiers can be killed by destroying a nearby fuel tank for example, and weak shelter, like a wooden fence, can be shot to pieces in order to expose the enemy.  The game can be played in four difficulty levels: easy, normal, hard, and black ops.  In easy mode, only the primary objective is required.  In normal and hard modes, some of the secondary objectives are required.  In black ops mode - unlocked after completing the game on hard - all objectives must be reached.  New weapons are also unlocked after finishing a level.
