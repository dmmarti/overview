 NBA Live 09 is a simulation of the basketball sport. As usual the player controls the athletes himself and tries to perform typical basketball maneuvers with his gamepad. The main difference to the PS3 and Xbox 360 version is that every new feature described there is missing. This means the game is more or less the same as NBA Live 08.  The player can choose between playing a whole season, play-offs or the FIBA World Championship. In the Dynasty Mode the player takes the role of the executive of a basketball team which means he has to grapple with managerial tasks like transfers or training Be-a-Pro is a mode were the player only takes control over one athlete.
