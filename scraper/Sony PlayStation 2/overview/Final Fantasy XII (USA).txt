 Final Fantasy XII is set in Ivalice, a fantasy world which also served as a setting for Final Fantasy Tactics. Two powerful empires, Archadia and Rozaria, are at war. All they care for is victory over the opponent. In order to achieve it more quickly, Archadia invades the small kingdom of Dalmasca. The young prince of Dalmasca falls in battle shortly after his marriage to the beautiful princess Ashe. The king is murdered under mysterious circumstances just before signing a peace treaty with Archadia. The iron rule of the empire is established in the small country...  You take control of a young thief named Vaan who lives in Rabanastre, the capital city of Dalmasca. Through a series of events Vaan finds himself involved in the political struggle, hoping to avenge the death of his treacherously murdered brother.  The game differs from its predecessors in many gameplay-related aspects. The traditional turn-based combat engine was replaced by free-flowing battles with real time elements, somewhat similar to western RPGs such as Baldur's Gate, or Knights of the Old Republic. You are unrestricted in your movements during battles, and there are no separate "battle screens". You can issue specific commands to your party members, or assign to them combat strategies (called "gambits"). New magic, abilities, and items are bought from stores or found in containers in the world, but before a character can use any of it they have to "buy" a license for it by spending license points earned in combat. In addition to the enemies and bosses found by following the story the player can also accept "Hunts" posted in bars or offered to the player after they show off their prowess. These are optional encounters where the player has to track down and either trap or lure a very powerful monster before defeating it.
