 Lowrider is a digital recreation of one of the US' most popular automotive subcultures, in which classic cars are lowered to the ground, fitted with hydraulics, and painted up in all manner of flashy colors and liveries. Pick from 18 different cars and show your skills at hopping, pancaking, juggling, and several other maneuvers in a contest against either the computer or another player. The game also includes a custom paint feature, as well as a soundtrack consisting of either southern crunk (in the US release) or Japanese hip-hop music (in the Japan release).
