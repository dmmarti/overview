 Warriors Orochi 2 is the sequel to Warriors Orochi, a game that combines characters from the Dynasty Warriors and Samurai Warriors games into a new unique storyline.  Wishing to test his strength, the Serpent King Orochi kidnapped the warriors of Dynasty and Samurai Warriors. After many battles he was eventually defeated, but the peace was to be short lived. While former officers from the Orochi army banded together to form their own armies, a mysterious group appeared to bring Orochi back from the netherworld. Picking up from where Warriors Orochi left off, this game pits the warriors of Wu, Shu, Wei and the Samurai against these foes and their armies.  This game features similar gameplay to the other games in the Warriors series, like unlockable characters, upgradable weapons and multiple stages to play through. Also seeing a return is the team mate system from the previous Orochi game, which allows you to rotate between three different warriors. Choose these three warriors from over 90 playable characters, and use them to battle with as you strive to defeat the vast armies of your opponents.  New features in this version include Dream Mode, which tells even more of Orochi's story then the last game, and new unlockable characters and weapons not seen before in the series.
