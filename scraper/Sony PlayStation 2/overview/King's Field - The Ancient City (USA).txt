 This is the third game in the King's Field series released outside of Japan (fourth in Japan).  The story begins when the hero gets a visit from a mysterious stranger.  The stranger gives the hero an idol and then vanishes.  At once the hero recognizes the idol as the "Idol of Sorrow" and goes to the land of despair to learn more about it.  Shortly before the hero arrives in this land though, a small force led by the prince attempted to reclaim the land again, but most of the men have disappeared.  Seek out the forest folk, as legend says they were the creators of the idol and will hopefully know how to remove the curse that is on it.  King's Field is a first-person role-playing game that utilizes both melee and ranged weapons, as well as different magic spells.  During gameplay expect to run into many monsters, puzzles, NPCs, and traps.  You'll use the items you collect throughout the game in various places later on.  A new and different keystone system is used in this iteration of the series where you can only teleport to designated key stones when near a teleportation circle.  Search the runes and discover the story behind the idol.
