 Devil May Cry 2 is the sequel to Devil May Cry and once again casts you as Dante, the demon slayer.  You control Dante as you battle demons through various levels, ultimately reaching the conclusion and to find out just why these demons are trying to kill everyone. To aid you in your quest, you once again have your trusty sword and various attributes, as well as new moves, like running on walls, aerial kicks, and multi-directional shooting.  This time around, Dante is not alone, as you have a partner, named Lucia. Just as much of an asskicker as Dante, Lucia utilizes a kind of knife which she can rapidly throw at her enemies.  All the special skills from the first game are here, again activated by your Devil Trigger, which has been improved for the sequel's release.
