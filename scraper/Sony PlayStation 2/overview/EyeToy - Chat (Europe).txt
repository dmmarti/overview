 Primarily EyeToy Chat is a video phone application for PlayStation 2s equipped with an EyeToy and a network adapter.  In addition to chatting and other video communication features, EyeToy Chat includes three simple games that can be played while connected.  Naval War is the classic game where players place their one to four long ships in a ten by ten area and then try to bomb each others squares in turns attempting to sink the vessels before the other does.  Chess and Checkers (Chequers) are the rest of the lineup and need no further description.  The games do not have any computer AI or local play option, players must be connected to the chat service in order to play the games.
