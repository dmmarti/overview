 Star Trek fans will remember the 'Mirror, Mirror' episode, and its parallel universe whereby common facts of the Star Trek universe are reversed. The Federation is now evil, the Enterprise is out for war, and most of its enemies and friends have changed sides. After hitting a wormhole, it is into this universe that your ISS Excelsior ship finds itself.   To get out of there, he must blast through 19 missions of space combat, armed with phasers and torpedoes. You will have to take on scouting missions as well as heavy attacks, passing asteroid belts and space stations. You are not limited to flying familiar ships - 6 new ones have been created for the game, and Romulan and Klingon fighters are available to switch to.
