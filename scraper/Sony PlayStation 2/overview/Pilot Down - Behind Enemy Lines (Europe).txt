 Over 180,000 Allied airmen were shot down on enemy territory during WW2. This game is about one of those men, trying to get to safety of Switzerland through hostile territory.  The gameplay is mostly about sneaking around varied environments such as a lumberyard, wilderness and so forth trying not to be detected by the German troops and making as little commotion as possible. With the aid of different objects (such as cigarette packs for distracting guards or apples for a quick stamina replenishing) the player must make it through the levels. The player character has a stamina which means that it's not very good idea to be standing in a freezing cold water for too long because if the stamina meter runs out, the health meter starts to deplete. Because of it, it's a good idea to warm up by campfires or eat something once in a while, thus restoring stamina. Of course there is some weapons also, which one can use to dispatch enemies that wander too close. They range from a piano string to machine pistols.
