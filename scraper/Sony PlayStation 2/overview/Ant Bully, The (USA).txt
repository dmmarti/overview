 Based on the animated movie, The Ant Bully puts you in the role of Lucas, a 10-year old boy who passes his time by tormenting an ant hill. Before he knows it, the ants use a magic potion to shrink him down to their size. Then they put him to work for the colony, giving him a fresh perspective on life.   Ant Bully is played via the mouse and keyboard, with character control performed via the W, A, S, and D keys. The mouse is used to perform actions, as well as moving the camera. The game is played from a 3D third-person perspective. You play various missions, and receive medals upon their completion. These medals are worth varying amounts, depending on how well you played: gold is 50 points, silver is 30 points, and bronze is 10. You use these medals to unlock special abilities every time you reach 300 points.
