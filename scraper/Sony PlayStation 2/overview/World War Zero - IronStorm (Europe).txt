 It is 1960 and the first world war never stopped being fought. In this different 1960, war is the only thing powering the global financial markets and warfare is one vast continent wide trench bound slogging match.  You play a commando sent to try to break the stale-mate.  You must cross the front lines and penetrate deep into enemy territory.  World War Zero: Iron Storm is a surreal look at a past that never happened.  A first person shooter set in recognisable locations with a big dose of twisted logic.
