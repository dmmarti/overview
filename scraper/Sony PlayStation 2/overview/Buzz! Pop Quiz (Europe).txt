 Buzz! The Pop Quiz is the seventh game in the Buzz! series, and like the previous games in the series, it must be played using the special USB ’Buzz! Buzzers’ controllers, instead of the regular controllers. The game is sold both with and without these ‘Buzz! Buzzers’, and there are four buzzers per set. This means that using the PS2’s two USB connections, up to eight players can play at once. Contestants must answer questions on categories within the world of nineties and noughties pop music spread over eight rounds including five new rounds. The rounds feature regular questions, as well as pictures and video clips. Also new to the game is the dancing of the characters when music is played on the set. There are several custom modes available, which allow you to create the perfect quiz by taking out the rounds you don’t want to play. A single player mode is also available.
