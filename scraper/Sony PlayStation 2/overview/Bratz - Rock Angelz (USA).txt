 Bratz Rock Angelz chronicles the adventures of the 4 main Bratz franchise girls -- Jade, Sasha, Chloe, and Yasmin -- as they follow their globetrotting fashion dreams on their way to start a world famous rock band. It starts when Jade receives a dream internship at a high fashion magazine with a tyrannical editor-in-chief who also employs twin sisters who happen to be Jade's arch-nemeses. Jade does not last long at this internship. She and her friends decide to found a competing fashion magazine and the adventure rolls on from there.  The game features 9 chapters and the gameplay alternates between 3D adventure and assorted minigames. In the 3D adventure mode, the player guides the current Bratz character around various rendered sets and interacts with other characters, who invariably give the Bratz goals to carry out in order to further the storyline.  The minigames include a fruit smoothie mixing game, where the player controls the smoothie stand and must make fruit smoothies per the Bratz girl's real-time specifications; a magazine layout minigame; a minigame where the player must pick out the right clothes for the editor's business trip; and many others. Successful completion of a minigame unlocks more outfits that the player can dress the Bratz characters in.
