 This game begins with mysterious glob-like creatures named Morphoids falling from the sky. You must stop these invaders from taking over the Nicktoons universe.  Globs of Doom allows you to play one of 10 heroes or villains from popular Nickelodeon shows including SpongeBob SquarePants, Plankton, Tak, Traloc, Jimmy Neutron, Beautiful Gorgeous, Danny Phantom, Technus, Invader Zim, and Dib. Each character uses a special gadget to defeat the evil Morphoids.  This title can best be described as a 3D action-adventure game. Players progress linearly through levels, traveling to locations such as Bikini Bottom, Amity Park, and Pupununu. Weapons and abilities can be upgraded by spending coins collected throughout the different worlds.  You can play single player or a second player can join at any point in the game for a co-op experience. In a two-player game, players can combine their powers to perform a powerful combo attack.  Globs of Doom is the fourth game in the Nicktoons series, following "Nicktoons Unite!", "Nicktoons: Battle for Volcano Island", and "Nicktoons: Attack of the Toybots."
