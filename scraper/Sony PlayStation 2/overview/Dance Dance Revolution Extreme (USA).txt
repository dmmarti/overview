 In DDR, you play on a mat, and as arrows rise to the top of the screen, you stomp in time with the music. Grey arrows at the top of the screen indicate when to stomp. Stomp in time and you get a "Perfect!" Or a "Great!" But step incorrectly, and you get a "Boo!" or a "Almost!", And you lose life. Life is indicated as a bar at the top of the screen.
