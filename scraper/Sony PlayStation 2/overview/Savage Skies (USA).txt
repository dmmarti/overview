 Savage Skies is an aerial dragon combat game for the PlayStation 2.  This fantasy themed game has wide range of features, that provide a robust single player game, split-screen multiplayer, and special modes, missions, and creatures that can be unlocked.  The story of Savage Skies centers around the death a powerful king struck down by the demons of a vengeful necromancer banished from the kingdom years earlier.  With the king's soul magically shattered, and the land in turmoil, the player is challenged to restore the throne by winning the war for one of three factions in the game - the noble Virtwyn, the mutated Chrysalis, or the necromantic Pariah.  Mission based animations and voiceovers provide the story elements to the player as the game unfolds.  Gameplay borrows loosely from other 3D aerial combat/shooter'eque games like Starfighter, Flying Hereos and DragonStrike, but has it's own twists, like advanced super maneuvers and power-ups.  Core to Savage Skies is the ability to unlock and try many different creatures (up to 24) in both the single and multiplayer portions of the game.  Each creature has strengths and weaknesses like speed, manuverability, offensive and defensive powers, that can be leveraged during the campaign missions.  Savage Skies also features fun 2 player split screen action with 7 unique multiplayer maps and 3 multiplayer modes.
