 SpinDrive Ping Pong is a 1-on-1 table tennis game. You have a choice of 10 characters, left or right-handed, coming from different countries. There are 3 skill levels, 5 areas you can play at and 6 rackets to choose from. The game offers three modes: training, exhibition and tournament. It also has a slow motion mode, like in action movies; even if you think the point is lost, you'll have the opportunity to return the ball. A charge meter is used to determine the strength of shots.
