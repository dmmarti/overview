 Mister Mosquito is one of the first games from Eidos' FreshGames group, which brings Japanese games to the North American market.  In Mister Mosquito, you play a mosquito, in the Yamada family house.  You must suck the blood of the three family members (wife, husband, daughter), without getting swatted or spotted.  You will only be able to suck blood for a limited amount of time, for sucking too long will irritate the person, causing them to swat you.  If you are spotted attempting to suck someone, you will then enter a battle mode, where you must hit various "Relax" and "Faint" spots, without getting squished.
