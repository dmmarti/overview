 In Rogue Ops you control Nikki Connors; after your family is killed by terrorists, you are recruited into the covert anti terrorist group Phoenix. Now you are seeking revenge on Omega 19, the terrorist group which you suspect is responsible for your family's death. There are eight missions to complete which have a combination of action and puzzle solving elements. You will often need to use stealth to be successful, making sure you quietly infiltrate an area without being seen, or if you are seen making sure no one sounds an alarm! You can hide in the shadows, in crates and vents, hang from the ceiling, and sneak up on guards to kill them before they see you. Of course, when action is required, there are a wide variety of weapons that will be used throughout the game; some weapons you'll come across are a pistol, a rifle, a crossbow, grenades, proximity mines, and more. There are three different difficulty levels available.
