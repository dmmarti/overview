 Bratz The Movie follows its predecessors, Bratz Rock Angelz and Bratz Forever Diamondz, however the game uses a higher defonition than previous games. Four playable characters: Yasmin, Cloe, Sasha and Jade. Blingz in this game appear orange instead of blue for the predecessors, but still act as money for buying with. The phone is also similar with the mobile phone menu, where you can read messages, and see the objective, what the player currently has to do, as well as the home feature. The player can again adopt a pet (cat or dog), and take them to pet shows, accessorize them, etc... The pet helps in certain objectives and tasks. A new feature to this game is your pet can find extra objects while not on an task, including extra treats, large amounts of money and the characters coins (which can only be found in this way).  Like its predecessors, the game has an explorable roam similar to Grand Theft Auto series. New features in the game include fashion designing (design full outfits), new mini-games, new tricks in the ice rinks, as well as learning to play the guitar in the new music academy. The game also re-explores London from Bratz Rock Anglez (with an additional subway added) and New York from Bratz Forever Diamondz (without the access of exploring Central Park). Each place (London, New York, Stylesville) you visit, there is one concert or fashion show you need to accomplish.
