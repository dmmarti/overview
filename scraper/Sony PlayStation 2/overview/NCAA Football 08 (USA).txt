 An update to EA's NCAA college football franchise with updated rosters and stats.  It has new features such as the ability to boost skill performance and increase overall ratings by making user-controlled plays that elevate the team's motivation levels.  As a coach, you can make promises to recruits to gain commitments and depending on whether or not you keep those promises, your coaching integrity rating will rise or fall causing players to transfer.  The game has many college specific features such as home field advantage, composure ratings, an all-new fatigue system, and new trick plays like the Statue of Liberty and Hook and Ladder.  You can revisit your top accomplishments in My Shrine, your personal Hall of Fame that stores trophies, custom photos, and video highlights.  There is a Campus Legend Mode where you can develop a player from a star high school player to a backup college player.
