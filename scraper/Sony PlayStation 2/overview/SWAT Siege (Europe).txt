 SWAT Siege is a shooting gallery title, reminiscent of games such as Cabal and Blood Bros. The player controls a SWAT agent tasked with clearing each level of all enemies. Like in Cabal, the player can only move left and right while also moving an aiming reticule across the screen to shoot enemies which appear from behind cover and at windows. The screen also scrolls slightly to the left and the right, and being hit once results in death. Score and weapon bonuses are awarded for shooting the enemies and they fly towards the player to be collected.
