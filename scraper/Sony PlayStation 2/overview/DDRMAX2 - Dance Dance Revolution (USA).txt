 The second PlayStation 2 DDR title released in Japan features 70 songs and includes the Diet and Oni modes in addition to the standard arcade mode.  As with previous titles, the player must hit the proper arrows (either with a dance pad or controller) that correspond to the beats in music.  Scoring well or completing certain songs will unlock new modes and songs.
