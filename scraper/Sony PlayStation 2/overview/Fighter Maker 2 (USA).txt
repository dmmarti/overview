 Fighter Maker 2 offers something you've never had before in a PS2 fighting game: the ability to build fighters from scratch using 3-D models that respond to your every direction. The customization process includes costumes, body types, special moves, camera angles, and everything you need to create a personally designed cast of fighting characters. Also included is an entire 3-D fighting game with a host of opponents ready to take your fighters apart. Once you prove your characters have what it takes to beat the locals, you can try your luck against your friend's fighters to see who can build the greatest fighter of all time.
