 Jack Slate is back, in this beat-up sequel to the first. He teams up with his K9 Dog, Shadow, to overtake the criminal underground in Grant City. The  main focus of the game is on Jack taking down crime after the kidnapping of a judge. He discovers a city full of corruption and betrayal.  Included is a 360 degree fighting system. Returning to the game is the super slow motion that was originally employed in  Max Payne games and The Matrix movie. You can now use Shadow to attack enemies in real-time while you beat down on other enemies. If his stamina bar is high enough, Slate's K9 will kill the enemy, and if he is tired, he'll work to keep any enemy away with vicious bites.  This game includes a lot of weapons including rocket launchers, grenades, and Molotov cocktails. The minigames are not essential to the game, whereas they were in the original game. However, most of the game is very similar to its predecessor.
