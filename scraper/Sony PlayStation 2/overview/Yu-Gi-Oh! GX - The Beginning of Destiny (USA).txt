 Continuing its tradition of events, the Duel Academy has decided to hold a "Tag Duel Tournament" this year. All the students are running about trying to find the right Tag Partner to ensure they'll win! You take on the role of a transfer student who has just joined in the midst of all the excitement. Players must duel the best duelists in Duel Academy, building trust and friendship in order to find the right partner for the "Tag Duel Tournament". In this tournament, whether or not you will find true friendship and "unity" depends on their compatibility with your partner and your dueling spirit.
