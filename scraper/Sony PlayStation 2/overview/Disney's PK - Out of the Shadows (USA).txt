 Donald Duck was minding his business one day at his boring security guard job when the evil Evronian empire decided to attack Earth. A computer being known as One detected the invasion early, and teams up with Donald to turn him into the superhero PK. Now it is PK's job to repel the alien invasion.  The PK character may be unfamiliar to American audiences, but he is popular in Italy (and some other parts of Europe) through a series of comic books.  This game is a simple 3rd person action shooter game.  You control PK as he targets Evronian soldiers with his blasters, jumps through colorful environments, and rescues captured scientists.
