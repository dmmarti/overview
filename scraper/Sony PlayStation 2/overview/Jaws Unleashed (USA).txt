 Based on the film series of the same name, players take control of the Great White killer shark known as "Jaws".  In an open-ended world, players visit Amity Island just in time for the 4th of July holiday season, and do what the predator does best: eat, kill, and destroy.  As the game progresses, Jaws will rampage through aquatic theme parks, chemical plants, beaches and more, facing off against boats, divers, and other marine life.  As players continue through the game, they will earn new upgrades that will allow Jaws to ram, bite, and survive with greater potency.  Up to 32 side quests are available, allowing various item and bonus feature unlockables.
