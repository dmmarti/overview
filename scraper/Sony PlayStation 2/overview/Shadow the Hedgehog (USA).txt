 Shadow the Hedgehog is a Sonic the Hedgehog series spin off title. Players take the role of Shadow the Hedgehog, Sonic's Nemesis from Sonic Adventure 2. Shadow must fight his way through many levels to unveil the secrets of his past. Will he choose to join Dr. Eggman or the Black Arms? Or will Shadow decide to fight only for himself and nobody else to discover the true meaning of Shadow's past? The choice is yours and only you can make it.  Playing as Shadow, you have many new abilities that Sonic does not have. For one, you can use a gun and punch people. You also have hover shoes instead of Sonic's plain old running shoes. You can follow whichever path you choose to follow to discover Shadow's true identity. You can collect the Chaos Emeralds or you can help Robotnik or the Black Arms. Depending on what path you choose, you will have a different ending.
