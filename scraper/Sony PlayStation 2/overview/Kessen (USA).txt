 A strategy game that tells the story of the events that brought feudal Japan out of a century of civil war and installed the Tokugawa Shogunate as the dominant political entity for the next two hundred years.  As either Tokugawa Ieyasu or his opponents, you'll engage in real time battles, including Sekigahara, one of the largest and most famous battles in Japanese history. Victory or defeat will stear you down a campaign trail, taking you either through the historical events of the time or down fictional 'what if?' scenarios.   Battles take place in real time, with you instructing your various generals on where to lead their troops, who to engage, and what special actions to perform. These special actions, such as firing your cannons, charging your opponent, or unleashing a flight of arrows, are depicted in close-up, cinema-like cut-scenes.   Before, after, and sometimes even during battles you'll be shown cut-scenes that depict the personal struggles of your various subordinates. This supplies the battles with story and drama. Koh Shibusawa, the head designer and producer of this project, even states in the opening screen that his goal was to try to create an interactive war movie.
