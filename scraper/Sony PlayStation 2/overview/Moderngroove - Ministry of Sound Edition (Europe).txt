 Moderngroove: Ministry of Sound Edition is 5 hours of brand-new electronica music from Europe's leading DJs along with thousands of dynamically-generated 2D and 3D visuals that synch to the music. It's a one-of-a-kind product that provides hours of entertainment for the entire house party.  What MTV Music Generator is to music mixing, Moderngroove is to visual mixing. The product allows users to create their own visuals with the Visual Mixer - even input your own text via USB keyboard or controller. Or simply turn on the "Karaoke mode" to incorporate the lyrics of each song into the synching visuals.  Moderngroove is the world's largest independent dance music label and is world-renowned for their compilation CDs, lifestyle magazine, travel tours, and of course, the South London nightclub that started it all.
