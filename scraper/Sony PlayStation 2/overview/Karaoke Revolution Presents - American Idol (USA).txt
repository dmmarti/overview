 Karaoke Revolution Presents American Idol pairs the popular line of Karaoke games with the television series based on a singing contest.  In addition to the standard Karaoke Revolution trapping, three judges have been added who comment on your performance.  Simon Cowell and Randy Jackson appear from American Idol, though Paula Abdul is replaced by original character Laura.  Venues are also recreated from the show such as the audition room and Hollywood theater.  The forty-song line-up is a combination of popular songs that have been used on American Idol and songs from previous American Idol winners.  Performing well unlocks video clips from the show and clothes for your avatar.  You can use EyeToy to give your character your own face.  Modes include the standard Karaoke Revolution modes like scoreless karaoke, duets and head-to-head elimination as well as an American Idol mode, which is essentially a career mode based on the structure of the show where you must make it through the audition and several rounds of elimination to get into the contest, then make your way to the top to be the next American Idol.
