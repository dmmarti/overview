 Shellshock takes you back to the dark years in Vietnam, in one of the most controversial wars ever fought. You take on the role of a rookie soldier on his first tour of duty. Using a third-person perspective, you experience napalm bombardments of civilian villages, sneaky night missions along the river banks, claustrophobic tunnel systems and huge battles in temples and open fields. Most missions are played as a team, but your team members cannot die and do no influence the mission objectives. You will have to assassinate enemy generals, take out crucial boats and guide your team through unknown territory.  The game does not have drivable vehicles, multiplayer options or extensive environmental interaction, but it features an interesting system of dismantling the many bombs and traps: in a race against time, you have to perform a long key sequence in the correct order to clear the path. The atrocities on both sides are clearly shown in the cutscenes, filmed as through a shaky hand-camera. Either side is not afraid to abuse civilians for their cause and this sense of realism gives the game a rather raw edge. You can even purchase the services of hookers in the base camp.  The game was originally developed for the PS2 and then ported to the Xbox and PC. To add to the atmosphere, songs from Lee Hooker, Percy Sledge, Status Quo, The Monkeys and many more, were licensed.
