 When the TV goes out just as the season finale of Crash Nebula starts, Timmy Turner asks his Fairy Godparents for a little help. When they find their magic is gone, they quickly find out The Shadow is responsible.  Unlike the console versions, Shadow Showdown for the PC is a collection of minigames, with animated cutscenes to pull everything together. Minigames include redirecting pipes to get card symbols to their cards, pogo-sticking along rooftops while avoiding snowball-throwing hippos, switching TVs to get them all on the same channel, and so on.
