 Dawn of Mana (Seiken Densetsu 4) is a game in the World of Mana / Seiken Densetsu series by Square Enix. The story takes place shortly before Sword of Mana and as an action game with exploration elements the gameplay involves traversing levels full of challenges including feats of dexterity, solving puzzles, and defeating monsters in various ways. Unlike the other games in the series, it cannot be considered an RPG.  Gameplay is separated by cut-scenes that depict the plot and story using the characters and environments, voice-overs, narration, and pictures. The player controls the main character, Keldy, who wields a sword for attacking, a whip for grabbing and throwing, and pellets for ranged attacks. Unlike the other Mana games there are no shops where equipment or new items can be bought - there are only music tracks and movie clips. Keldy can only enhance his combat performance with certain ribbons and special arrows. Enhancements come through emblems, by meeting certain requirements, left behind by enemies or bought at the Challenge Arena shop. They usually boost the character's basic abilities. Magic is also available through seven different spells.  The story is divided into eight chapters and the game also sports a Challenge Arena mode where players need to complete 32 separate challenges, optionally with the help of a pet, bought in shops or obtained through eggs discovered in the game. The game uses the Havok physics system, allowing Keldy to use his whip on almost any part of the environment. This is further encouraged through the game's Mono system, where objects hit in the surroundings of enemies induces panic, also making available boost medals.
