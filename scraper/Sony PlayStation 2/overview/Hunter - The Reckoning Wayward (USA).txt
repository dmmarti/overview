 The town of Ashcroft is plagued by darkness once again.  A cult of evil has formed; the undead threaten the living.  All that stands between light and darkness is a group of Hunters, rogues and renegades who have had their life touched by darkness and now battle against it.    This one or two-player game allows the player/s to pick among five unique Hunters and battle the undead in Ashcroft using a variety of weapons and special powers called Edges.
