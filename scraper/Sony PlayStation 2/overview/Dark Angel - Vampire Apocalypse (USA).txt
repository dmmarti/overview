 Dark Angel: Vampire Apocalypse is a 3D action-role-playing game set in the seventeenth century, where you play as Anna, a mysterious woman who must protect a village against the armies of the Shadow Lord, which are made up of vampires and other assorted creatures.  Gameplay is much like the Diablo series where you are assigned a quest in one of three villages, then accomplish it in one of three dungeons or one of three battlefields battling randomly-generated groups of monsters that drop random equipment based on a drop-rate formula.  You improve your character through a slow progression of leveling up from experience points and finding better equipment or purchasing it from villagers.  Each mission you accomplish improves the economy, research or military stats of the village you are doing it for, which is what determines which items they have available for purchase.  There are three basic monster-types: Undead, Forgotten and Mutants.  There are seven basic types of melee weapons.  Two each do extra damage to each type of monster and the final does extra damage to groups.  There are also four kinds of guns and a variety of bombs.  The object of the game is make Anna into an all-powerful warrior through battling and questing before a year is up and the Shadow Lord attacks.  This takes upward of 100 hours of game time.  At this point, she must defeat the Shadow Lord for good.
