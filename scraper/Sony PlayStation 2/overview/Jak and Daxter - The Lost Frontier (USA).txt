 Story-wise, Jak and Daxter: The Lost Frontier picks up after the events of Jak X: Combat Racing.  Jak, Daxter and Kiera travel to the Brink -- the edge of the known world -- to investigate the recent Eco shortage, and end up caught up in a struggle between the region's inhabitants and a group of Sky Pirates.  The gameplay is a return to the series' 3D platforming roots -- a balance of jumping/traversal challenges, weapon-based and melee combat.  There are also several aerial combat segments (both objective-based and free-form dogfighting), as well as brawler-like stages where the player controls the giant, Hulk-like "Dark Daxter".  As usual, the player can unlock and customize Jak's Eco powers and vehicles along the way.
