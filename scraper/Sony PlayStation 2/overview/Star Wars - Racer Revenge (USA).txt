 Presenting a new sequal to the hit racing game, "Star Wars: Episode 1 - Racer":  "Star Wars: Racer Revenge"!  Here's what LucasArts says about it:  It has been eight years since the first spectacular Podracing showdown between Sebulba and the young Anakin Skywalker. Seeking payback for his humiliating loss, Sebulba has a new beefed-up Podracer and lust for revenge. But it's not going to be easy: Anakin has grown into a boldly skilled Podracer pilot. Thus the stage is set for Star Wars® Racer Revenge’, bringing newer, faster, and even more dangerous Podracing to the galaxy-taking you on a one-way ride to ultimate victory. Jockey for position with a tangle of Podracing opponents or leave the pack behind at intense, nerve-jangling, planet-scorching simulated speeds of up to 600 mph. Crash and bash competitors into oblivion as you take them out of the race for good.  Get down and dirty against 16+ of the most aggressive Podracers in the galaxy and smash your opponents into twisted wreckage  Feel the heat and roar of a horde of opponents on your tail--the turbo-charged Podracer AI means you're never on the track alone  New, never-before-seen characters and Podracers, plus a few of your old favorites  Race to the finish in the Boonta Eve Classic or earn your place in the winner's circle on 13 devilishly challenging courses on four new planets, plus Tatooine  Multiple game modes include practice, single play, tournament, time trials and versus  Developed by Rainbow Studios, makers of the hit games Motocross Madness and ATV Off-Road Fury
