 It's been two years since the invading alien menace was defeated by the Earth Defense Force, but like any good off-world threat, they're back for more, and they've brought new weapons and technology in their attempts to take Earth and eliminate humanity. Thankfully, the EDF has also been developing new technology to fight them, and as a member of the EDF, you are among the first on the front lines to fight them.  Global Defence Force (The Chikyuu Boueigun 2) is a third-person action shooter. Choose from either an EDF infantryman or the flight-capable Pale Wing, each with different abilities and dozens of weapons each, and set out to shoot down hordes of giant insects, enormous robots, and UFOs of incredible scale. You can choose two weapons to carry for each mission, and pickups dropped by enemies will unlock new weapons and increase your character's maximum health. You can play the game split-screen cooperatively.
