 Once, an isolated island continent  was plunged into war. The people who wished to end the warring revived a powerful weapon called the "Admonisher" and threatened the participants of the war with it. Thus all of the wars were ended by force. The people behind this called themselves the "Peace Maintenance Brigade." 20 years later the old men of the Brigade are no longer able to maintain the peace.  Now war has once again broken out among the inhabitants of the continent. A mysterious famine has appeared, leaving the citizens to fight over what little fertile land is left, while the cities are constantly attacked by fierce amphibious monsters known as "Screapers"  Battles take place in real-time, and there is no transition to a separate battle map (which is usually found in traditional Japanese RPGs). As such the game forces players to come up with strategies and tactics immediately as the situation calls for it.
