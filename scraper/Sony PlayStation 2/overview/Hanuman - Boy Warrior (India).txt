 This story is a classic "Good versus Evil" story. It is a "growing up" story of Hanuman. He starts as a powerless monkey and regains his powers through the game. He learns about the exploits of Hanuman and never realizes that everyone is talking about his exploits till the moment of truth when that realization dawns on him. So the key theme here is the emergence of a hero and the message that one can become a hero through bravery and justness of their actions. There are a number of defining moments in the story. Bal Hanuman's discovery that he is actually Hanuman, the regaining of his powers one by one; and the final Wow moment where Hanuman is standing on a hilltop with a bright sun in the sky. Lastly the fact that Hanuman never kills his adversaries only frees them (Soul) of their bad Karma is a defining moment in the story.
