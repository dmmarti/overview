 SpyHunter: Nowhere to Run is a combination of racing/3rd person shooter that stars professional wrestler-come-movie star Dwayne "The Rock" Johnson as spy Alex Decker as he battles the evil organization NOSTRA in its bid for world domination.    As in other games in the Spy Hunter series the player pilots the high tech Interceptor, a vehicle heavily equipped with lethal weapons that can also transform into a different vehicle type (i.e. from a car to a boat to a motorcycle) used to fight enemies of a evil nature with similarly equipped vehicles but with less armor than the Interceptor. New to the series is the 3rd person run and gun shooter game play featuring the likeness of said Johnson using firearms and WWE style wrestling moves.
