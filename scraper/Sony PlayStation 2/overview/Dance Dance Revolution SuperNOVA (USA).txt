 Another sweat dripper from Konami, Dance Dance Revolution SuperNOVA features 74 different songs to dance to, an adventure mode, online play, and EyeToy support.  The game includes animated dancers as well as classic music videos to accompany your dancing. A versus mode allows two people to play on two dance pads at once. The game also can interact with data from its arcade sibling.  New songs can be unlocked by playing "Stellar Master" mode. This "adventure" will take you to dance through a series of alien planets. You'll be starting with 42 games and from there you'll unlock the rest.  The EyeToy allows you to use your hands to interact with the screen to give you more of a full body dancing.
