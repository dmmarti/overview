 One year has passed since Kazuma Kiryu, "yakuza with the heart of gold", defeated his biggest adversary in the  previous game. Despite this victory, Kiryu has lost more than he had ever imagined.   But events from the past continue to haunt him. A man he had admired so much, who was like a father to him, has revealed a terrible secret before he died. It's time for Kiryu to solve the mystery once and for all. Caught in the eternal fight between Kantou and Kansai, the Eastern and the Western mafia groups of Japan, he soon realizes that there are other powers on the stage, including a mysterious Korean organization that seems to be connected somehow to his past...  The sequel to Yakuza continues the story from the previous game, featuring many recurrent characters. The main gameplay idea also remains the same - adventure-like exploration, hand-to-hand fighting, and slight role-playing elements, similar to the kind of gameplay that was introduced in  Shenmue games. The sequel features some technical improvements, such as the ability to rotate the camera during the fights. It also contains more side-missions and mini-games, ranging from playing pool and mahjong to running a club and dating girls.
