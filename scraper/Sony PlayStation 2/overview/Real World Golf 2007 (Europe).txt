 Real World Golf 2007 is the sequel to Real World Golf. Like its predecessor it make use of the Gametrak, an external hardware gadget that tracks your motions. To use it you put on a set of gloves which are linked to the Gametrak with thin wires. Using a small plastic golf club you can make the swing you need through determining the force and possible effects you want to give the ball.The Gametrak can read out speeds ranging from 2000 miles per hour to 1 millimeter per hour.  Once you start the game you no longer need to use your keyboard or gamepad, all menus can be navigated with use of simple hand gestures. The game itself contains 15 new 18-hole courses which have to be unlocked one by one. You can play in various modes such as tournament, championship, training and party. Party mode includes several mini games such as hitting cars in the parking lot, hitting a giant bulls-eye in the sky, hitting as close to a target as possible or hitting through hoops. New in this version is a completely revamped putting method. Each game mode can be played against the AI or friends in hotseat multiplayer.
