 Bringing High Heat to a new level, this 2004 version takes all the best from previous versions and adds more to give you a top-notch baseball game.  This new version brings you improved graphics thanks to a new graphics engine.  You also get new career and franchise modes so you can manage your own team and build up multi-year stats for it.  Recruit from all the minor leagues (A through AAA) to help your team become the best.  Play the 2-on-2 Showdown and select a pitcher and batter to compete against another pitcher and batter.  This does not include competing against another human player in the PC version, which has no multiplayer support.  Also, experience a more realistic audio environment as you hear people yelling and cheering, and vendors selling hot dogs, not to mention the return of the two-man announcer team.  Watch realistic player movements, including jumping and diving for the ball, sliding, and even shaking fists when hit by the ball.
