 Tourist Trophy: The Real Riding Simulator is essentially Gran Turismo on two wheels.  You have about 120 licensed bikes and 30 tracks in a realistic motorcycle-racing simulation.  Of course, motorcycles don't handle like cars.  This is reflected in-game by giving you control over your rider's side-to-side leaning to affect cornering.  Of course, all the standard simulation elements of braking, positioning, throttle control and condition of your ride are important as well.  The game is divided into two main modes.  Arcade mode allows you to do timed runs, quick races against AI opponents or split-screen racing.  The main mode, Tourist Trophy, first puts you through a series of licensing tests.  Each license opens up a group of challenges or races.  Each challenge or race corresponds to a motorcycle, which you can earn by winning it.  There is no cash in this game.  Some events also unlock further events, of course.  Bikes are customizable.  You can set the tire compound, brakes, shocks, gear ratio and exhaust.  Riders have even more options.  Not only can they wear a variety of licensed clothing, their riding style is customizable, allowing you to adjust things like the position they take in leans, which affects handling.  In addition to these Tourist Trophy also features a photography mode, which allows you to take pictures of the game in action and save them to a USB flash drive or print them directly from a printer attached to your PlayStation 2.
