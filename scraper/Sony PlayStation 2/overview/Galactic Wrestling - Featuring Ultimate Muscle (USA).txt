 GWfUM is a wrestling/fighting game developed by the same development team that did Def Jam Vendetta.  There are 45 different characters based on the Fox Channels "Ultimate Muscle" TV show, each with their own unique features and finishing moves.  There are several locations to wrestle in along with six different modes including one on one exhibition, tag team, battle royal and even a five on five tag team match.  Four players can use multitap to play against each other or tag up against each other.
