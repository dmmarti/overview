 While the title of this game boasts the ESPN license, this is actually the next game in Sega's NFL 2K series.  ESPN NFL Football has many gameplay modes that include quick game, franchise, season, tournament, practice, first-person football, and online play. The most extensive mode in the game is the franchise mode. This mode allows you to play one season after another and comes complete with a draft and off-season player dealings, like signing and releasing players, governed by the real rules of the NFL, where trade deadlines and salary caps are standard.  Another new feature in ESPN NFL Football is a virtual apartment called 'The Crib.' The Crib serves as a showcase for all of the bonus items and awards you win by completing objectives. The objectives range from simple accomplishments, like looking at certain things in the game's menu, playing for one hour, and playing for five hours, to big play accomplishments, like returning a punt or kick for 99 yards or completing a game without dropping any passes. With every completed objective, you earn a trophy or item that you can use to decorate your crib. The items range from different-looking furniture, like couches and bar stools, to bobble heads and in-game cheats. You can also find hidden free agents, like Michael Irvin, and posters and soundtracks from old Sega games, like Jet Set Radio and previous NFL 2K games.  Another feature added to this game is first-person football.  This setup was created to give you a virtual experience of what it's like playing on the field.  Chris Berman again adds ESPN style commentary for the audio track.
