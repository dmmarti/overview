 Zathura is a third-person platformer based on the 2005 fantasy science fiction film of the same name, which is in turn inspired by the book by Chris Van Allsburg. After an argument with his brother Walter, Danny goes into the basement of his house and finds an old mechanical board game. When they start to play the game, their house is catapulted into space, they get a large battle robot, and visit other planets in order to complete the game and return home.  You play in turn as either one of the brothers or the robot. Walter can melee combat with a wrench and shoot projectiles while Danny has a slingshot, and the robot can shoot lasers or a charged shot, and can charge an enemy and jump high. As they progress through the different levels cut-scenes advance the story. They can grab power-ups and need to fight boss enemies as well.
