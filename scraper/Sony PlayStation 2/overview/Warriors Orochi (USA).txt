 Warriors Orochi is a crossover between Koei's Dynasty Warriors and Samurai Warriors franchises.  The Serpent King, Orochi, has made a rift in time and taken the most powerful warriors from the Sengoku period of Japan, and China's Three Kingdoms era for a showdown of the ages.  Battle the demon Orochi, and hack and slash his armies with a team of three warriors you can rotate between at any time.  Your two inactive teammates will recuperate during their downtime.  If your active character dies, however, you'll have to restart the mission or load a saved game.  A total of 79 playable characters from Dynasty Warriors 5, Samurai Warriors 2 and two new combatants are available to you.  The new Weapon Fusion technique allows you to combine a particular character's different weapons into a single stronger one.  Choose from four unrelated story campaigns, Shu, Wei, Wu, and Samurai Warriors Story, with different unlockable characters, weapons and items in each.  In the game's Free Mode, you can use any character in any stage you've already completed.  Play with a friend in two player split screen co-op.
