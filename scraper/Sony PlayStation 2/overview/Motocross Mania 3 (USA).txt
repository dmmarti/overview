 After two PSX games, Motocross Mania returns on the PS2. In this game you race on 20 different courses, using 8 different riders with customizable bikes that can be upgraded, as you fight with weapons from chains to cattle prods, and baseball bats to hammers, while doing stunts to earn money for unlockables like better riders, cool costumes and weapons. You can either try to win the race or beat the other riders to pulp.  The basic game modes are Championship, Single Race, Time Trial, Freestyle, Multiplayer and Mini Games. This version includes new game modes such as Last Man Standing and Battle Royal where the focus is on arena fighting. During the race, you can fill a mania meter that slows down time.
