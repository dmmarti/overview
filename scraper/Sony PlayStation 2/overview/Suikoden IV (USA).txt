 This is the fourth installment of Konami's famous role-playing series, which are loosely based on the classic Chinese novel Water Margins by Shi Nai'an. The events of the game take place 150 years before those of  Suikoden III, and the region of the Suikoden universe they occur in are the islands south of Toran. The hero of the game is a young orphan who was brought up as a servant in a nobleman's house on one of those islands. One day, he finds a magic rune, and realizes it is the Rune of Punishment - one of the 27 legendary True Runes that grant the bearer enormous power. Yet while devastating the enemies, this rune is also bound to deplete the hero's life....  "Suikoden IV" retains many classic features of the series: the ability to recruit 108 characters (Stars of Destiny) and to build and develop your own castle, emphasis on political issues in the story, the ability to equip runes of various kinds in combat that allow the usage of magic spells, etc. You can now have only four active members in your party (six in previous games). Once again, there are three types of combat in the game: the most common, party-vs.-party combat, the duels, and strategic ship battles, which replaced the army battles from the previous games.
