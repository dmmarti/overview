 A complete conversion of Konami's newest arcade hit, Police 24/7 boasts revolutionary motion-sensor technology and non-stop action gameplay. The action begins in Los Angeles' Little Tokyo district where the elusive "Gokudo-Kai" organized crime family is suspected of illegal weapons smuggling. As a police officer looking for the opportunity to rise in rank, players embark on a special assignment to apprehend the Gokudo-Kai members and crack down on criminal activity. Police 24/7 features remarkable USB motion sensor technology, requiring players to move their entire bodies to perform realistic manoeuvres such as dodging bullets, peering around corners and laying low to take cover. A compatible USB camera is required for the motion-sensor--Konami recommend an Omnivision camera--but the game's playable with just a light gun or in fact even a standard controller. The fast-paced action intensifies as players fight a crime ring that spans from Los Angeles to the bustling Japanese city of Shinjuku. Players progress throughout the game to earn performance-based points, which will eventually lead to the coveted title of Commissioner.
