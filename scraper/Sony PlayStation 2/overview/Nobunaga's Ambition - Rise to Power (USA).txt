 Nobunaga's Ambition: Rise to Power is the first instalment in KOEI's long-running Nobunaga's Ambition strategy game series to feature full 3D environment. The player once again take the role of Nobunaga Oda, or one of his rival warlords, and set to unify 16thy century Japan under one ruler.  The scenarios spans from 1551 to Nobunaga's death in 1582, and feature hypothetical 'What if' turns of event. The many characters present in the game affect how events turn out with their unit stats and skills. From the castle and surrounding areas, the player issues orders to manage the resources and growth of the land under the warlord's control. The construction of the village and the life of its people evolve in real-time. In battle, either field battles or sieges, up to 24 units on each side ranging from spearmen to cannon troops can engage in real-time 3D battle. Routing the enemy lowers their morale, which allows the use of charges and counter attacks. In siege battles, the adequate use of skills and resources is key to victory.  When most of the land is under the player's control, the 'Kessen' command becomes available. Kessen is an all-or-nothing all-out attack that will either result in the unification of the land, or the total loss of the player's land.
