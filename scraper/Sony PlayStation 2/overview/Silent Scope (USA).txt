 This coin-op conversion doesn't have a sniper rifle light gun, but all the scoping action is still here.   The aim of the game is to save the captured family of the President of the USA, by sniping all on-coming enemies as you go along.   As an enemy appears, an area of the screen zooms in, allowing you to easily pick off the guy in the head. Once done, press a button to zoom out, so as to choose your next target.
