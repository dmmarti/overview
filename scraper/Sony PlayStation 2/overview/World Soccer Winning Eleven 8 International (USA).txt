 World Soccer Winning Eleven 8 International has over 3000 licensed players, and Fully Licensed Leagues and teams from Serie A (Italy), Liga Espanola (Spain), and Eredivisie (Holland). So this new PES has definitely improved on the License front. There's also full leagues of England, France and Germany. Also there is a revamped Master League, and this time you don't have to start with them stupid rubbish Default players, you can start with the proper team!!! Still if you want a challenge you can choose to start the ML with the default players. Another thing you can create your very own team, and play against the world in the Master League, and you get to swap the Default players, for half-decent ones! It's not just the master league that's changed in the Edit mode, you get to edit or change the player's goal celebrations! Another feature is the PES Shop, you acquire points to unlock bonuses!
