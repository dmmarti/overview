 This stand along expansion to Armored Core 2 includes 100 new missions based five years after the events in AC2. Once again your task is to complete a range of tasks (from destroying enemy mechs to seeking out bases and carriers), and each mission comes with a reward. The money raised goes to upgrading your mech for the bigger battles down the line.  2 player split screen is supported for dog fighting action.
