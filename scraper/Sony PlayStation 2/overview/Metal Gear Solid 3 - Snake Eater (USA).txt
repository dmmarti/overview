 Snake is back... but this time literally back in time. Not a sequel to MGS2, but a new game with a setting before all the other Metal Gear games thus far. The time of Cold War, 1960's.  But, how is Snake still Snake back in time, not looking any younger. Well in fact, he is looking younger, as you no longer play The Solid Snake, and if you ever wondered who was the renowned super-soldier that Liquid, Solid, and Solidus were all clones of, you'll meet him in battle for survival in this 3D action-adventure game.  The survival of the fittest still works, but this time it's not only about dodging enemy bullets and staying out of sight. You have to think of your stamina, and as it goes along with survival, you gotta eat sometimes. And to help you blend with the environment, Snake is wearing a large stash of camouflaged uniforms.  So, the Cold War, a situation created after the Second World War when the world was torn between East and West, is about to heat up as Soviets got their top scientist, Nikolai Stepanovich Sokolov, back due to agreement with the US government for withdrawing the nuclear missiles from Cuba. Now, with Sokolov in their hands, they're up to developing a nightmarish new weapon, and upon realizing the urgency of the situation, CIA formed a plan to recapture Sokolov, and they dispatch the covert FOX unit to Sokolov's research facility, located to the south of the great Soviet fortress of Groznyj Grad. Led by former SAS member Major Zero, FOX is a next-generation special-forces unit that operates both as a specialized combat group and as a covert intelligence outfit. The FOX unit's modus operandi is to send a single agent, backed by radio support from afar, into enemy territory to carry out solo sneaking mission.  August 24, 1964, a lone soldier swoops down from out of the blue. The man's code name is Naked Snake... and things are about to escalate. It's a one-man war now, and the future of the world may now rests entirely on his shoulders now.
