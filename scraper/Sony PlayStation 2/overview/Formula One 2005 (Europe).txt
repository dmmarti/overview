 The 2005 game in Sony's licensed Formula One series has been updated with the official teams, drivers and circuits from the 2005 season, including the new Istanbul track in Turkey, which will be opened on August 21, 2005, and the Red Bull Team. This instalment also introduces online multiplayer, up to ten players at the same time, with a world ranking ladder.  Next to the season mode and quick races, the career mode has been expanded, and there are new features such as interactive pit stops, a pre-race grid line-up set against a backdrop of mechanics, grid girls, journalists, cameramen and special events. By advancing in the career mode, you can unlock classic F1 cars and bonus tracks. The game supports EyeToy with DigiMask technology: create your own driver and wrap your picture smoothly around the model's face to be the champion yourself.
