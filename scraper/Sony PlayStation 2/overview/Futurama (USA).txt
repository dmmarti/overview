 The Futurama series, winner of a 2002 Emmy Award for Best Animated Program, has been recreated on the gaming console. The game has been developed in close cooperation with the people behind the tv series and is presented as a 3D platform game with an authentic cartoonish look. All famous characters make an appearance and the story is guided with animations and original advertisements with the look and feel of the TV series.  'Mom' has bought Planet Express Deliveries from Professor Farnsworth and has gained control over planet earth. It's up to your crew (Fry, Leela, Dr. Zoidberg, Bender, ...) to stop her evil plans.
