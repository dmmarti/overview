 Dingo Egret is minding his own business, investigating a hidden power source Metatron, when out of the blue his mining team is ambushed by BAHRAM. He discovers that the source of the Metatron is actually an abandoned battle robot, Jehuty (as used in the original Zone of the Enders), and decides to use the machine against the BAHRAM.  Dingo soon realises that there's more to the story then simply wanting to own a powerful machine, as treachery and evil power comes into play. It's up to you to control the Jehuty and destroy any plans the BAHRAM for evil purposes, at whatever cost.  Along with the basic set of Mech style air and ground battles over a range of play fields, you can also play battle against a friend in 2 player battle mode or try out the special VR training missions.
