 It's sometime in the far future, where "The Corporation" controls everything.  People are generally happy, except for a resistance group called "Freedom", who do not like The Corporation's dictator rule.  In SoE, you can choose from one of five different characters; Spanky, an ex-gang member; McNeil, a disgruntled ex-cop; Bull, a criminal in prison; Libra, a lawyer; and Phreak, an orphan.  You must complete a variety of missions, ranging from Rescue missions to "Kill This Person" missions to "Blow Up This" missions.  You have many different weapons at your disposal, including shotguns, machine guns, pistols, knives, rocket launchers, tear gas launchers, flame-throwers, gatling guns, pepper spray, molotov cocktails and more.  You can even use street furniture, such as boxes, construction cones, benches, signposts, trashcans, and more.  Or, you could break the glass of a store, and use the items there as a weapon, such as a DVD player or a television.  You will fight many different enemies.  Gang members, skinheads, and The Corporation forces.
