 Race well and claim victory against your opponents to earn prize money, which you can use to unlock extra Trucks and if youâ€™re really good, the ability to race down the gullies and through the canyons at night! You'll be racing huge V8 powered Monster Trucks around rugged man-made indoor tracks, which are home to the fiercest and most monstrous truck races known to man! Monster Trux Extreme utilises an ultra-realistic physics system to ensure every bump, nudge, crash and crunch on the race track affects your vehicles as it should.
