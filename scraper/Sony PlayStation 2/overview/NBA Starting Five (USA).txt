 NBA Starting Five is an NBA-licensed basketball game, and a follow-up to Konami's earlier NBA 2Night games.  Included players and teams are based on the 2002-2003 season. Game modes include Exhibition, Quick Start for a random match-up, Season, Playoffs and Franchise (up to 25 seasons in length). Franchise mode features the rookie draft between seasons, as well as signing, trading and releasing players. The signing is based on a point system, with 1000 points available to spend for the entire team.  Multiplayer options allow control of the entire team or individual athletes for competitive or cooperative play, with up to 4 players supported on Xbox and up to 8 on PS2 via multitap.
