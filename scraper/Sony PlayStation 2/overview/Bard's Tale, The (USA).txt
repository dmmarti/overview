 A self-proclaimed "quest for coin and cleavage", The Bard's Tale is more of a whimsical take on role playing games than a remake of the classic series.  Following the exploits of The Bard (voiced by Cary Elwes), this single player game adds humor to the traditional sword and sorcery mix.  As The Bard, players can fight off hordes of foes with blade and bow and summon companions through magical Bard Songs.  The Bard's Tale uses the Dark Alliance engine and has a similar camera and control scheme.
