 All of the riders from the MotoGP motorcycle championship are here to choose from, including hall of fame riders. As well as the Vs. and Arcade modes, there is also a challenge mode where, much like Gran Turismo's license mode, you must complete certain challenges to unlock new tracks, riders and pictures. These challenges range from beating the clock, to winning certain events in the arcade mode.
