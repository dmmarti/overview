 Greetings earthlings! I, Cryptosporidium 137 of the Furon Empire, happened upon your planet on the way back from destroying the martians. Due to some experiments with atomic weaponry, we lack genitalia and the quality of our clones has degraded. Since you pathetic humans all carry Furon DNA in your genetic code, I have been instructed to collect fresh samples. Survival is not an option, but you should be honoured to support the legacy of the Furon Empire!  Destroy All Humans! is a humorous action game with winks to the era of the goofy fifties' sci-fi movies. Crypto can hypnotize and scan people, and lift objects using psychokinesis. He can also control humans using the Hypno Blast to impose his commands. Extracted DNA can be exchanged in your mothership for new weapons and ability upgrades. Furon weaponry includes a Zap-o-Matic, disintegrator ray, abducto beam, quantum deconstructor and even the famous anal probe. Not to be overpowered, you have to disguise yourself using the Holobob. There are different alert levels, similar to the Grand Theft Auto games and if you are not careful, you will be hunted down by the police, military or the government.  You are constantly in contact with the mothership, where you can purchase upgrades, save the game and apply for new missions. Crypto does not have to run all the time, he can also use his flying saucer to abduct humans or animals, cause havoc or face bigger threats. Next to the story-based missions, you will also be instructed to collect specific samples or kill a certain amount of humans in a race against time.
