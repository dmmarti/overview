 The first Gundam game for PlayStation 2, Mobile Suit Gundam: Journey to Jaburo follows the exploits of Amuro Ray and his friends and colleagues aboard the White Base as they engage in various missions against the Principality of Zeon. Based on the popular anime, gameplay in Mobile Suit Gundam is reminiscent of From Software's Armored Core 2 with an arcade touch. Before each mission, players can choose to equip their Gundam with various weapons such as a long-range laser rifle and Beam Saber for melee attacks, or the GunTank and GunCannon can be called to provide backup in some of the game scenarios.
