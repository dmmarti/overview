 Lego Soccer Mania is a Lego-licensed soccer game. Teams are based on characters from Lego sets. The game takes a more arcade-style approach to soccer, with fast-paced gameplay and power-ups that aid your team. There are five game modes: Quick Start, which starts a game with random teams, exhibition mode, story mode, Skill Zone, which has five tutorials on how to play the game, and Lego Cup, a World Cup-like mode (suitable for being released in 2002, a World Cup year) where you choose a country and face other countries. You start with only three playable teams, but you unlock each team you defeat in Story Mode and unlock one player each of a special team in each of the six objectives in Skill Zone mode.
