 Ben 10: Alien Force is based on the Cartoon Network television series of the same name. Its now five years after Ben initially retired the Omnitrix, but a new alien threat has caused Ben to use it again. Ben can take the form of characters from the Alien Force team, and include Gwen and Kevin Levin as his allies to combat a new alien threat and save Grandpa Max. This brawler-style platform game has multiple attacks that can be combined into special attacks, as well as chained combos to quickly defeat enemies. Along with Ben, the player has two new powerful allies in Gwen, who can create shields, and Kevin Levin to absorb materials around him.
