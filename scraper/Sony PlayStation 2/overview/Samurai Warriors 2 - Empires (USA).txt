 Samurai Warriors 2: Empires is an expansion to Samurai Warriors 2. It is the third Empires expansion by KOEI, following Dynasty Warriors 4: Empires and Dynasty Warriors 5: Empires. Similar to the other Empires games, it adds turn-based empire-building gameplay to the mix.  Although battles are still fought using the same 3rd-person button mashing mechanics that the Samurai Warriors-style games are known for, players now must also choose the battles to maximize the growth of their burgeoning empire in Japan's Warring States era. In the Empire mode there are several historical battles available.  The game also adds two previously unplayable characters, Shibata Katsuie and Sasaki Kojiro, as well as a Create Your Own Character mode.
