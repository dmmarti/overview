 A puzzle game in which the goal is to place as many 2-color falling blocks (a la Tetris) on the playing field in like-colored blocks in order to wipe it clean.  During play, a timeline crosses the field from left to right, clearing and counting up your matches.  The more matches you make before the timeline wipes them clean, the bigger the combo multiplier towards your score.  As you progress through the game, Lumines will reward you with new "skins" which completely change the graphics, sound effects and music during play.  In "puzzle" mode, you stack the blocks in order to create the various shapes that you are shown.  Lumines also lets you play against the CPU or wirelessly against another player on the PSP.  The 2007 PS2 port is completely identical to the PSP version, except for some new skins.
