 This is soccer, the Sega way. Instead of the usual technical football we are used to, Soccer Slam presents 3 on 3 soccer with a collection of crazy, over the top characters and special moves to create a non-stop action atmosphere.  Using elements similar to EA Sports' NBA Street, Soccer Slam also contains power ups to increase the zany gameplay even further. Game modes include Quick Start, the Continental Cup Quest plus a practice mode and a Tourney multiplayer mode.
