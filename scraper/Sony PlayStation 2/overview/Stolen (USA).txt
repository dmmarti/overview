 You play as Anya Romanov, a thief living in a not too distant future. You and your partner in crime, Louie Palmer, have recently landed a job to steal a statue that's been placed in a museum for an exhibition. Once you're in the museum things turn out not to be quite so easy and not quite the way the should be.  The gameplay resembles Thief: The Dark Project but also feels a lot like Splinter Cell and Metal Gear Solid to an extent. Several elements can be recognized from those games, but many of these have been changed slightly or just implemented in an original way. The core of the game is about stealing, without killing.
