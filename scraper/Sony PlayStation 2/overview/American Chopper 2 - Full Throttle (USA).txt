 American Chopper 2: Full Throttle is the sequel to American Chopper and like its predecessor, based on the Discovery Channel show of the same name.  You pick one of the four main characters from the show, then one of seven customer motorcycles from the show and are given a series of mostly racing missions where you earn fabrication points with which to upgrade your bike.  These missions include things like nitrous boosts for quick bursts of speed and point bonuses for performing tricks.  Since American Chopper is a show about making custom bikes, this game offers a wide variety of performance and aesthetic upgrades with the ultimate objective of building your perfect custom motorcycle.
