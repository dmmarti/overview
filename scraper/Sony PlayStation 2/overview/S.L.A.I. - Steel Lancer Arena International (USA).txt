 S.L.A.I. – Steel Lancer Arena International is a Playstation 2 sequel to 2002 XBox title Phantom Crash. The story takes place 40 years after the events in Phantom Crash and cyber-punk athletes continue to battle their robots in arenas created by destroyed uninhabitable environments.   S.L.A.I. (pronounced “slay”) is an arena based robot fighting game. Controls are similar to most console FPS’s, but the camera can be switched between first person cockpit view and behind the robot third person view. Defeated opponents are replaced with new entrants until the player is defeated, leaves the arena, or time runs out. Money is based on performance and can be used to buy new robot parts and adjust existing parts for speed and power. Finally, the onboard “animal chip” gains experience depending on performance and increases the robots lock-on speed, armor, reticule size, and more.
