 Developed by Kuju Entertainment, Crescent Suzuki Racing puts players in control of the meanest superbikes and sidecars on the international circuit. Chicanes, gravel traps, and other dangerous hazards will challenge drivers across 16 different racing circuits as they compete against other players or several ruthless AI opponents. Additional features include six varying championships, almost 20 different time trials, 25 kinds of superbikes -- including the GSX-R1000, and the ability to customize and tune your bike just the way you like it.
