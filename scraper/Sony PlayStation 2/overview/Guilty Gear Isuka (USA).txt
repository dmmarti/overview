 The next installment in the Guilty Gear sci-fi fighting series, in which bio weapons called Gears fight among each other for ultimate supremacy and survival, as they escape the so called Holy Knights who aim to hunt down and destroy them.  As with previous games in the series the game involves tournament-styled battles between characters using their special abilities and moves. However for GG Isuka the battles are 2-on-2 instead of 1-on-1, taking place in multi-plane arenas (similar to Fatal Fury) and requiring the players to switch orientation manually.  Added features include two new characters (only one playable), new backgrounds and game modes including the new "Boost" mode, which turns the game into a 2D side scrolling beat 'em up.
