 Sonic Riders: Zero Gravity is a hoverboard-racing set in the Sonic universe and it is the sequel to Sonic Riders. When four mysterious meteorites crash into the planet, they accidentally activate MeteorTech robots around the globe who go on a rampage. It's up to Team Sonic to find out the mystery behind the MeteorTech and why the robots are going after the meteorites.  Compared to the previous game, this edition presents some new abilities. By performing tricks and completing challenges, gravity points can be earned. This allows for the Gravity Dive that opens up a black hole, sucking the player in and thus providing faster speed, and Gravity Control. By changing gravity alternate paths can be used through walls and other surfaces. A third one is called Gravity Drift. Just like the Grip move in the previous game, characters can use it to turn tight on corners. There are various items, obstacles on the course and different vehicles such as hover boards, bikes, air riders, yachts, air skates and other crafts. These can all be upgraded, even while racing.  The three new game modes are Survival Mode (smash into opponents on certain parts of a track), Survival Relay (relay courses with multiple players) and Survival Ball (football game). There are sixteen courses with two tracks each, sixty different vehicles, and eighteen playable characters, of which most need to be unlocked. They are divided into three categories (Speed, Fly and Power) and have personalized gear that allows them to make use of specific short-cuts.
