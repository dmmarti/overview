 James Cameron's tv series in game form. Dark Angel has you playing as Max Guevera, a 'genetically engineered super-soldier' running around in a post-apocalyptic Seattle, looking to uncover past, family and the evil plans of the "- I - Corporation".  Most of the game involves beat-'em-up style hand-to-hand combat. Max can pull off a variety of flashy moves such as roundhouse kicks and backflipping off walls. The camera also enters the 'bullet time' mode when she does a combo sometimes. Certain levels ask you to assume use of the few stealth skills that Max has to offer.  The game features voiceovers by the actual stars of the show - Jessica Alba and Michael Weatherly.
