 This is the latest installment of the Capcom/SNK crossover series; this time around not developed by Capcom, but by SNK - hence the change in title from andquot;Capcom vs SNKandquot; to andquot;SNK vs Capcomandquot;. It's again an oldschool-style 2D beat'em'up with a wide selection of characters from SNK's and Capcom's classic Beat'em'Up series.
