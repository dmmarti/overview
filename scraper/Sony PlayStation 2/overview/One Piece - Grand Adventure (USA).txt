 One Piece: Grand Adventure is a fighting game based on the manga and anime franchise One Piece, by Eiichiro Oda. The game is pretty much similar to the previous One Piece: Grand Battle!, instead Grand Adventure features more playable fighters (adding new characters that appeared in the series over one year), modes and options than the previous game. It's playable by up to two players, where fights take place on a 3D stage with live environment, like bombs, sandstorms and sea waves, besides various items that serve either for buff or weapons. Single player features a story mode which follows the suit of the original series, on which the player as a pirate captain must gather a team and fight their biggest rivals.
