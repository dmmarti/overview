 You play as Strawberry Shortcake, dreaming of a would full of friendship, love and strawberries. But when a greedy baker plans to take over their hometown and steal all their hard-earned crops, she and her friends then journeyed to the Land of Dreams in order to turn back the tide.  Just like most platforming games, you jump, collect coins, er, seeds, and explore your way throughout various levels. There are also some minigames, which, though uninspired for a hardcore gamer, would probably keep a child occupied.  In later levels players will be given access to various dream powers, which is functionally similar to Plasmids in  BioShock, allowing the player to spawn platforms or zap enemies, at the cost of some points, which can be recharged, somewhat like EVE.  The game also includes some interesting extras such as recipes for various desserts, as well as extra playable characters and a virtual farm mode which allows players to grow various plants.
