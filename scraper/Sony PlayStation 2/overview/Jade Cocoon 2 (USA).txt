 Jade Cocoon 2 is the sequel to Jade Cocoon: Story of the Tamamayu. The events of the game take place a thousand years after Levant's adventures in the first game. You play Kafu, a young warrior, who must defend his country from an evil force called Kalma.  The gameplay is pretty similar to that of the first game. It is a monster-breeding RPG. Fight monsters, catch them, breed them, cross-breed them, and create a powerful army that will help you to complete the quest.
