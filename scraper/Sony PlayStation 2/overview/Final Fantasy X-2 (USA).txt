 Final Fantasy X-2 is the first direct sequel in the history of the series. The events of the game take place two years after Yuna and her guardians defeated Sin in Final Fantasy X, and peace was restored in Spira. Rikku (remember this cheerful Al-Bhed girl from the previous game?) finds a strange sphere that mysteriously shows an image resembling... Tidus, Yuna's one and only love! Rikku brings the sphere to Yuna, who now doesn't look any more like the shy, quiet girl we know from FFX, but rather like a cool action heroine in short pants and with a gun in each hand. Determined to discover the truth behind the mystery, Yuna organizes a journey of "sphere-hunting", to find more spheres scattered around the world, and perhaps to find Tidus...  The series underwent important changes in this game, especially gameplay-wise. The ATB (active time battle) system is back, after it had been replaced by turn-based combat in FFX. The battles develop at a quicker pace than earlier games in the Final Fantasy series, with more emphasis on quick decision and timing. You have a party of three characters: Yuna and her friends Rikku and Paine (yes, you control only girls in this game!). The job system similar to that of Final Fantasy V is back, with the possibility to learn various abilities and to freely customize your characters' classes. Jumping and climbing are now possible in certain locations. Also, the gameplay is non-linear, untypically for console RPGs. Right from the beginning you have your airship, and you can explore the entire world at your pleasure.
