 Based loosely on the vehicles, events and characters of Star Wars Episode II: Attack of the Clones, you must pilot the new Jedi Starfighter, a sleek force powered vehicle, to defend a planet from total destruction.   Jedi Adi Gallia  is trusted by her former master Mace Windu to stop an incoming invasion on the Karthak system planned by Cavic Toth. With the aid of Nym and his ship Havoc, you must control both the Jedi Starfighter and the Havoc to stop the incoming invasion.  The Jedi Starfighter, much like a Jedi, uses force powers as its main weapons and defense systems. You can use the likes of Force Lightning and Force Shockwave to knock down enemies, and defend yourself with Force Shield and Force Reflex.  Also included on disk is a two player co-operative mode and deatmatch/capture the flag options.
