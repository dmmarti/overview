 The truckers return and this time you have to get Ma Jackson off the hook after being arrested for tax evasion. Bribe the jurors as you take the roll of Ma's cousin Jacob in a race to make money by trucking and trading. Drive and go almost everywhere at any time in a bigger environment than the original finding shortcuts and new towns to go trucking in. Trading is only a small part of the game and has been simplified to allow more time driving.
