 Race as one of twenty-five drivers at nineteen tracks, in this simulation of the 2001 Winston Cup season.  Race head-to-head against your friends, or try to beat the real drivers' ghost cars in Race The Pro.  Real racing scenarios are recreated to provide a quick challenge, in Beat the Heat.  The Xbox version differs from the PS2 version: it has all-new track models, textures, and car models.  Also, rather than returning to the UI between Practice/Qualify/Race, the player would experience "race day" on a track-side monitor.
