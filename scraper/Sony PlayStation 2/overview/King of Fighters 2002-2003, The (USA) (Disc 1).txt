 The King Of Fighters 2002 Unlimited Match is an remake of the original The King of Fighters 2002: Challenge to Ultimate Battle. The game now has many new features, including all new music, completely redesigned stages, and many more characters.  The game includes all the characters from the original version (with the exception of K9999, which has been replaced by a new character, Nameless), it also adds ten new playable characters from The King of Fighters '99, The King of Fighters 2000 and The King of Fighters 2001, as well as the bosses from all the aforementioned games and Omega Rugal, the final boss in the original version of The King of Fighters 2002: Challenge to Ultimate Battle. These bosses are all unlockable; along with them, there are also six hidden characters to unlock.  Like other recent SNK releases, the game also has an endless mode where you can play as long as you can keep your character alive, a challenge mode where you must clear certain objectives and challenges, and character and ending galleries. The disc also includes the original Neo-Geo version of the game - it does not include any of the additions (such as extra characters, remixed music, or the puzzle game mode) from the earlier Dreamcast and PS2 ports of the game.
