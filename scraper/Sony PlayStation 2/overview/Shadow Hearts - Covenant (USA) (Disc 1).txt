 Shadow Hearts II is a direct sequel to the unusual console-style RPG set in a real world and in a concrete epoch. It is 1915, and war raises its ugly head to greet the nations of Europe. Half a year after the events described in the first game, the young Yuri Hyuga finds himself in a small French village under attack of German soldiers. But soldiers are not the only threat that awaits him: a mysterious magician that seems to have a personal grudge against the hero appears on the scene. Accompanied by friends who follow him for various reasons, Yuri will travel all over Europe and to the Far East, and once again face his own past.  "Shadow Hearts II" implements a combat system that is similar to the first game: the Judgment Ring, an arcade addition to strategic combat, is still there, along with Yuri' special ability to transform into monsters and to visit the graveyard for more powerful fusion variants. The Sanity Points system from the first game is also present. Character upgrading is now more flexible (you can assign different magic spells to characters), and you can also team up to perform combo attacks.
