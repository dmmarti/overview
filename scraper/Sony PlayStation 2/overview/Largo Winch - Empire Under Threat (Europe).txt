The hero - Largo was a Yugoslavian orphan, who was adopted by the world's wealthiest man, who was in search of an heir. When his adoptive father dies, the now 26-year-old Largo inherits the Winch Corporation, a financial consortium worth more than 10 billion dollars. Drawn to the challenge of presiding over such a vast empire, Largo takes over from his father, and plunges headfirst into a new, unexpectedly vicious world of murder and deceit.
