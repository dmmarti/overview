 Orphen: Scion of Sorcery is the game based on the hit Japanese anime Sorcerous Stabber Orphen, (released outside of Japan as just Orphen).  Orphen, his apprentice Majik, traveling partner Cleo and her pet dog/magical-wolf Leki, and the two mischievous trolls Volkan and Dorton, sail to the mysterious Chaos Island in search of wealth and riches.  Also on the voyage are three strangers whose destinies pull Orphen and his companions into their mysterious journey.  Only the powerful dark sorcerer Orphen, (in his trademark bemused manner), can discover what connections there are between the three strangers and the powers that rule the island, and keep himself and his companions alive long enough to find a way off of the ephemeral Chaos Island.  Orphen: Scion of Sorcerery is a mix between adventure and some light RPG elements.  Orphen is a dark sorcerer and attacks his enemies with various spells including a magical sword and elementals.  The game is played in the third person perspective looking over Orphen's shoulder.  You will run, jump, and explore your way through large levels on Chaos Island in varying environments; engage in boss battles that require you to use some puzzle solving and timing skills; and level up your dark magic. Once beaten, the game encourages replay by following branching story lines not taken in the previous play-through.  The game maintains the feeling of the anime, particularly in the character designs and bantering dialogue.  Orphen: Scion of Sorcery is entirely voice acted.
