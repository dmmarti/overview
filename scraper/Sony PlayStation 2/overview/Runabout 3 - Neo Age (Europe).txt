 Runabout 3: Neo Age is an open-ended racing game where the racing isn't restricted to strict tracks and the player can choose their route, as the races are mostly driving from point A to point B. Like in the previous games, you don't really have to drive clean and crashing everywhere while winning the race is not only allowed but also encouraged as there is points to be gained from destroying various objects. There are over 20 different vehicles to drive with and over 30 missions which range from simple races to checkpoint races and "deliver the package"-missions.
