You are in charge of a starship and your mission is to fly through the corridor and drop bombs down the air shafts to destroy the alien invaders in their spaceship below. But first you must fly through the force of Thi fighters and shoot them before they attack you with their deadly accurate laser bombs. Use your bombs carefully, you have a limited number.    Intergalactic Force was programmed by Charles J Roslund for Anteco Software.
