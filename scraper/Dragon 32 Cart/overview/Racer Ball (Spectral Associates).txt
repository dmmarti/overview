Racer Ball is a maze-chase game inspired by the Namco arcade classic Pac-Man. You control your Racer Ball through the corridors of the moon base, avoiding the Laseroids. Pick up the solar cells for points, and you'll advance to the next level when all solar cells have been collected. Additional items will appear in the maze, which can be collected for extra points. There are four energizers that can be collected and that will enable Racer Ball to chase down and destroy the Laseroids for a short amount of time.
