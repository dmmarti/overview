Your aim is to zap the Ultrapede before it can reach you. Blast part of its body and the remaining sections wind their way downwards along separate paths bouncing off of the mushrooms as they go. Look out for Sid the spider who will appear every now and again to crash into you, and be attentive to Brian who will suddenly arrive dropping his deadly fleas on you and create yet more mushrooms!!
