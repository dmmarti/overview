With a name like that, what can one expect, save an isometric shooter with heavy Zaxxon influences? Yet, even though Zak's Son makes no attempt to hide its influences, it doesn't slavishly mimic its role model. Unlike Zaxxon, you are flying a helicopter, and this game entirely lacks the concept of height above ground. Any shots fired will hit whatever it crosses, be it on ground or airbourne. You also have your fuel level to keep an eye on. By shooting canisters marked with an F, you replenish your dwindling fuel supply. Failure to do so results in game over, and so does the loss of your three lives. The game plays entirely in black and white high resolution mode.
