Ice Master is another early Pengo clone. Your small man runs around in a landscape filled with blocks of ice and populated by insects. Your only goal is to crush the insects by pushing ice blocks at them. You can only push one block at a time. Trying to push a block that is blocked by another block will instead destroy the block so that you can push the one behind it. All insects must be crushed before you can go on to the next level, which is made more difficult by the fact that they respawn, so killing all in a quick succession is required. Bonus score is calculated based on how much time is used. The game runs in black and white high resolution mode, with artifact colour on NTSC machines.
