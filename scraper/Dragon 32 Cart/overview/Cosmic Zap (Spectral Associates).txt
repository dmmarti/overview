Color Zap is a variant of the arcade game Space Zap. It is a shoot em 'up where the player has to protect a stargate that is located in the centre of the screen. The stargate is stationary so the controls are limited to aiming and shooting at the aliens that appear from the four sides of the screen. When the alien ships appear they launch photon torpedoes that the player has to shoot down before they reach the stargate. The stargate is equipped with three shields and one is lost at every hit. At every 10,000 points an extra shield is awarded and the skill level increases by two. After a wave of attacks a death satellite will start orbiting the stargate and the player has to shoot it down before it attacks. Firing the gun will heat it up which might lead to a meltdown.
