Time to dig out those whites and pads and have a game of cricket. You have the chance here to play a sixty over game against a friend or the computer. You can choose your own team but if you don't fancy it then England or the Rest of the World are your two choices. If you win the toss you can choose whether to bowl or bat first. Another option is your skill level, Test, County or Village. If you choose to bowl first you can choose from six bowlers who are fast, medium or spin.
