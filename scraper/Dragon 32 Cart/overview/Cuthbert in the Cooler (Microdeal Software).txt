Cuthbert is in a fix again - playing with his time transporter. Trying to outwit the Moronians he's transported himself back to World War II and been locked up in a German Prisoner of War Camp. Can he escape the drunken guards, get the keys to the gate and make his way across the rivers, marshes &amp; minefields to freedom?
