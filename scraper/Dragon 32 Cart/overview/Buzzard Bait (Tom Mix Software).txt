Buzzard Bait is a game for one or two players. Two players will play the game simultaneously and can choose to be friendly and team up against the enemies or fight each other for additional points.    Your character sits on top of a giant bird and flies around the screen. You can knock other riders off their birds by hitting them from above. Similarly, computer controlled enemies or a second player can knock you off your bird. Enemies knicked off their bird will fall down as eggs, which can be collected for additional points. Uncollected eggs will eventually hatch and the character is reborn, waiting for a bird to come pick him up to join the fighting again.    Buzzard Bait is a version of the arcade game Joust.
