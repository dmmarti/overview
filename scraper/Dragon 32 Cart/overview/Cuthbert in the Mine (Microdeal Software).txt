The Moronians finally captured our hapless hero Cuthbert and put him to work in the mine, (together with several of his friends), which is guarded by a fierce demon. The only means of escape is a small hole in the ground. You must guide Cuthbert to safety by running along and jumping the rails, avoiding the trucks. If a truck hits him he will end up being fried in the fire below. Also, the demon guard doesn't like his prisoners escaping so he is constantly on guard and the fireballs that he spits out must be avoided at all costs.
