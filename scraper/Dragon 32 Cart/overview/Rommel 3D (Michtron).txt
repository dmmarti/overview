Rommel 3-D is a Battlezone variant. The player controls a tank from a first-person perspective and can move freely around a flat environment where various geometric objects act as obstacles. The aim of the game is to score points by shooting the tanks that appear on the battlefield one at a time. There are two different tanks: dumb ones which are worth 1,000 points and smart ones which are worth 1,500 points. Additionally there are planes which attempt to crash into the player that are worth 1,300 points. The smart tanks move quicker and have the same level of manoeuvrability as the player. To aid the player in finding the enemies a radar shows their positions. The player starts with three lives and one is lost when getting hit by an enemy. A new tank is awarded for each 10,000 points earned up till 100,000 points and thereafter every 20,000 points.
