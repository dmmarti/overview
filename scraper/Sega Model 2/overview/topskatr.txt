Top Skater is an arcade skateboarding game developed by Sega AM3 for Sega Model 2 hardware. Its spiritual successor, art-wise and music-wise, was Crazy Taxi, which was also directed by Kenji Kanno; other spiritual successors of the game include Air Trix and Ollie King. Alan J., the DJ of Top Skater, would later provide his voice again for another Sega arcade game, F355 Challenge.
