Sega Rally was a major success in the arcades, bringing rally-style racing to the masses before the Colin McRae games. Four detailed tracks have been created, with a succession of stomach-churning bends and jumps, and you can choose from 3 different cars. As well as the main championship, there is a time-trial mode featuring a ghost car to beat, so you always know how your run compares with your best-ever. Two machines can be linked for multi-player action. The handling of the cars is unrealistic, to put the focus on action and instant playability.
