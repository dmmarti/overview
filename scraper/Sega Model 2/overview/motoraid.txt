With its futuristic bikes and the rare ability to fight while racing the game bears obvious inspirations from both the Akira (1988) and Venus Wars (1989) manga and anime adaptation, Psygnosis's Wipeout (1995) for its futuristic planets, and from the Road Rash (1991) game series.  The game is available as a single or two-player cabinet. Game modes include "Championship" and "Practice" and playable characters are named Geila, Gunz, I.O and Robin.  Unlike other Model 2A racers like Manx TT Superbike or the original Sega Rally Championship, Motor Raid was not ported to the contemporary Sega Saturn or Windows 95. It was expected to emulate this game on Model-2-Emulator, by ELSemi or Nebula, starting in 2004.
