Sega Water Ski is a Sega Model 2 arcade game which simulates water skiing. As a result, the player controls the game with their feet. It should not be confused with Water Ski, a much earlier arcade game by Taito. Sega Water Ski has never seen a home release, though its soundtrack was released along with Motor Raid's in Motor Raid/Water Ski.
