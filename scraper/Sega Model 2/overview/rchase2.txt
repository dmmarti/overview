Sequel to the original Rail Chase. This version maintains the chase perspective while broadening the scope of the game with more ways to go and other features.   The game is a shooting game where you jump aboard a runaway mine cart and must shoot at any oncoming enemies. Players use a fixed joystick with a trigger to control the action. The cabinet has a three axis motion base which allows for upward inclination, downward inclination, left/right and up/down movements.
