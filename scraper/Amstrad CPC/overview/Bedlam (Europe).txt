Bedlam is a vertically scrolling space shoot'em-up. Space fighter shoots patterns of swirling aliens and stationary cannons, collects extras and fights boss ships Bedlam is ordinary shoot'em-up material, stretched out over 16 short levels and spiced up with your standard two-player option. While ZX Spectrum and C64 see a genuine space shooter with full-screen backgrounds and level variations, CPC and DOS get bare-bone versions stripped down to Galaga level.
