You have been sent down into the Great Barrier Reef in a submarine to collect lots of cash, although I don't know how it got there. The reef is really a large maze, and you'll find some sections cut off ? but there are bombs lying around which will enable you to reach other sections of the reef. Watch your oxygen levels as well, and don't touch the fish, or you'll lose one of your nine lives.
