Jocky Wilson's Darts Challenge is a darts game endorsed by the 1989 world champion. The game options are a 16-player tournament featuring up to four human players, a head to head game for two players, and single-player 'round the clock' (hitting the numbers 1 to 20 consecutively against a time limit). During gameplay, the whole of the board is seen. The dart cursor swirls around the screen, can be controlled in a limited fashion and is released by pressing fire.
