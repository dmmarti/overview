	Set in the future, the object of Raster Runner is to guide your bike around the arena while trying to surround your opponent with the energy trail your bike leaves behind. Your opponent is doing the same. When one of the bikes crash, the player who took control a bike loses one life. A crash can be avoided by activating a force field, but only up to three can be activated. The player who loses all of their lives loses the game, while the other player wins. To assist you, a small overview map can be used to keep track of the bikes.
