It's 1992, and there has been no conflict between the world's superpowers for many years ? but there is now a serious threat to Earth, a threat so serious that the World Security Council has been put on DEFCOM 1. Those aliens are up to no good again, and they've been detected in the Vesta-7 sector of Ceres. This is a shoot-'em-up in three parts, and you control a different vehicle in each part. You have to fly to the space shuttle launch site in a helicopter, then fly the shuttle through an asteroid belt, and then take on the aliens in a space fighter. In the first and third parts, you also have three smart bombs.
