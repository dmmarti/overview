The aim of this oddity is to nurture a garden, and keep the pesky insects away from it. This is done by switching between the game's two characters ? Grell, a gnome who mainly comes in handy for killing the insects, and Falla, a fairy who flies about sprinkling various dusts on the garden to make it grow.
