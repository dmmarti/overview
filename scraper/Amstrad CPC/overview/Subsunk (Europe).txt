Subsunk is a text adventure with graphics that was developed using the QUILL game development tool. The player takes the role of a reporter, Ed Lines, from the Seafaring Gazette. Ed is out on assignment reporting on what life is like aboard a modern submarine. Ed gets more of a story than expected when the sub is attacked by an enemy power. He hides and, unlike the crew, escapes capture leaving him alone aboard the submarine at the bottom of the sea. Ed's task is to find a way to summon aid by sending the SUBSUNK message back to HQ.
