	The game is combination of first-person helicopter simulator and isometric/3rd-person espionage action/adventure.    You as Johnny McGibbitts, ace pilot and neurosurgeon has given a mission against the "Mad Leader". You have to fly in helicopter behind enemy lines and make a diversion there. You can fool the choppers into believing that you are a one of bad guys, and also you can show false documents to guards in enemy camp. If they aren't fooled then you can use spray of sleeping gas or even a grenade. There are many houses in the camp, which has many rooms, which has many useful items, but you often don't need them because of the limit of time for operation.
