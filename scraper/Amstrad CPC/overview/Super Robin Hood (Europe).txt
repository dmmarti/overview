	Robin Hood, the world's first socialist, pushes wealth redistribution to one side here - his only concern is rescuing Maid Marion from the clutches of the Sheriff of Nottingham. This will involve crossing Sherwood Forest, before entering his castle and progressing through it's enemy-strewn rooms.    Gameplay is flick-screen and platform-based. Spiders and guards' darts must be avoided - contact with these drains your energy from its initial 99, as does falling any distance, although health tablets can be collected. Hearts must be collected from each screen, as must keys to operate the medieval lifts.
