The Aim of the Game: destroy the Enemy's Starships by blowing up the nuclear reactors using the bombs scattered on the surface of the ships. For placing the bomb you must decode 3 locks by pressing fire when the "LOG ON" side is lit. If you make a mistake the starship will detect your meddling and destroy you. To hinder your progress, there are alien opponents who will seek to destroy you. They will keep appearing until you have destroyed all the reactors, at which point the status section will show how many are left to kill before you have cleared the ship. You must destroy all the reactors on the ship. Once the starship is cleared, you will be picked up and carried to the next ship. Total in the game have ten ships.
