In this game our ridiculously named hero, the Schroedeldoedel, is on a mission to find and kill Mr. X. You find yourself trapped within his lair, a place full of nasties and deadly traps. To progress you must shoot or avoid everything (even the walls are deadly) and make your way to the next screen.
