Doors of Doom (Plus) is very colourful, accompanied by reasonable music, and has a fair degree of strategy and zapalogy involved. Each time you find a piece of the weapon system, you must find out how to use it, then face losing it when you teleport to the next level. Your task is to eliminate all the robots, keeping an eye on your energy level and picking up cups of tea to revive you.nnAll this would be perfectly hoopy, but  the scrolling  is well jerky (as they say), and your little character seems quite happy to walk through the air in places, as well as on the various bridges, monoliths and girders of the background.nnnnThe game's main saving grace is the scenery designer, which allows you to edit the background to your own taste. In fact, the instructions spend more time explaining this option than dealing with the game itself, giving some indication of how exciting the whole business is. Doors of Doom (Plus) - ? I'd hate to see Doors of Doom (Minus).
