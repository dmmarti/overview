You're a pupil at Dr. Scrimes' spook school, and have to show your worthiness by taking a series of tests. It's actually set in his large mansion, where you'll encounter some rather strange guests, such as a hunchback, a werewolf and a mummy. Your first test is to use whatever you can to fill some holes in the walls around the mansion. However, when you find out that none of the objects seem to work and you can't fill any of the holes, you'll soon tire of the game.
