	There's trouble in Metro City. The members of the Mad Gear Gang have kidnapped the mayor's daughter Jessica and the clock is ticking.     Final Fight is a 2D side-scrolling fighting game.   Taking on the role of either Cody, Guy, or Mike Haggar, you must advance through six areas of the city clearing out the gang infestation.   You will have to cope with a variety of thugs, ranging from firebomb-throwing maniacs to behemoth wrestlers. To defeat these thugs, you have an arsenal of punches, kicks, throws, and jump kicks at your disposal.
