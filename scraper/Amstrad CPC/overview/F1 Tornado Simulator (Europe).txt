You are the pilot of a F1 Tornado and you must fly it over 4 levels in the Middle East destroying as many enemy fighters and ground installations as you can. At the end of each level is a large piece of military equipment to destroy. F1 Tornado is a side view horizontally scrolling shoot-em-up. The joystick is used to control your plane while the fire button fires your current weapon. When a helicopter is shot it leaves behind a icon. Collect the icon and press the space bar and you upgrade your weapon. As well as the main playing area you can also see your score, lives and your current weapon.
