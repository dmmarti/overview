In this mahjong game, you play the east wind against the computer. The course of the game is less complex than it seems at first glance. A round begins with the construction of a square wall, which constitutes the pickaxe. The breach is determined by one or more dice rolls, then the tiles are distributed to each player, at a rate of 13 (16 in Taiwan) per player, starting from the breach. In turn, each player draws a tile at the end of the wall, integrates it into his game and spreads between the four walls a tile he wants to get rid of.
