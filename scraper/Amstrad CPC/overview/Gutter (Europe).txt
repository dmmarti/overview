The first thing the player/players of Gutter must do is inserting credits, using them to access the ball. In turns, each of you have to guide a ball down a gutter surrounded by a patchwork 3D effect. This is done by steering it left and right to give it angular acceleration.

You can hit the jesters, kings, queens, and chalices for points and bonuses. Avoid the axemen and monks - the axeman takes your life, and monk returns you to the start of the game/ Different royal members, including monks, increase your score. As such, hitting monks can be a good move if you are confident. On the right of the screen you may see your career progress in the gutter (D/1/2/3/0/S).
