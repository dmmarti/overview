The computer game based on the profanity-laden comic sees three characters from the comic, Biffa Bacon, Johnny Fartpants and Buster Gonad, racing in the Fulchester fun run, with Roger Mellie (the man on the telly) providing the commentary. The race consists of five levels, and you must win each level if you want to go to the next one.
