The evil Cult of Sagalia has taken over Sherwood Forest and installed fear into the hearts of the dwellers. An attack has already been fought off and failed by Robin Hood and his Merry Men. With another attack taking place, Friar Tuck doesn't think this will be enough once again so he has arranged with the Bishop of Derby to carry out an exorcism. When the Bishop failed to show, Friar Tuck went searching for him but sadly came across his dead body holding a bloody parchment with a rhyme on it. Reading the rhyme, Friar tuck realises that it holds the clues to how to defeat and get rid of the Cult of Sagalia. In this flick-screen arcade adventure where you view the action from the side at an elevated angle, you play the role of Friar Tuck as you search the surrounding area for the objects needed to complete your mission. Various objects are scattered around the forest and you must find them and use them in the correct locations which you can carry three items at a time. As you explore you will come across various creatures who will shoot at you and if you are touched by them or their weapons then you lose one of three lives. To help you, you can throw swords and collect and use better weapons as the game progresses.
