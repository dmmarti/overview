	Killed Until Dead is a sophisticated mystery game with a leaning towards humor. The player has to solve every aspect of a murder case before it happens. The five biggest mystery writers in the world have gathered together at a hotel and one of them will be offing another unless Hercule Holmes can crack the case.      Gameplay is a cross between the board-game Clue and the paper-based logic puzzles in which the player must eliminate clues in sequence. To solve the forthcoming murder, you will have to search the suspects' rooms and confront them with the evidence and set the hotel's security cameras to record secret meetings.     By questioning the suspects as to what they know about certain people, rooms and objects, they may reveal combinations they know will not be involved in the murder - perhaps if it involves the gun, the killer will not be Lord Peter Flimsey, for example.  However, there's a catch. If he accuses the wrong suspect, he might be the one who's Killed Until Dead - they don't take kindly to false accusation.
