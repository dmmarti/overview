	Every 4 galactic-years, alien athletes from every inhabited planet in the galaxy gather to compete in the Purple Saturn Day games. Four interplanetary events await the player- Pilot a ship through time and space, race around the rings of Saturn, solve a fast-moving electronic puzzle and navigate a futuristic obstacle course.    Although not an official entry in the series, this game is in the same vein as Epyx's popular Games "series" titles.
