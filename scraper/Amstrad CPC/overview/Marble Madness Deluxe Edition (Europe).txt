	Marble Madness Construction Set gave enthusiasts of the arcade game Marble Madness a chance to create their own layouts that was not seen in any of the other home versions. However, it lacked a direct conversion of the arcade's level designs, which is where this Deluxe Edition comes in. Alongside an improved version of the construction set, the original game is converted, although without multicoloured graphics.
