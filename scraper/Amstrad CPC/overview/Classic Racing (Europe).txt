You and up to five other players have the opportunity to own a stable of sixteen horses and enter them into race meetings in order to win prize money. You can play anywhere between four and sixteen meetings, and there are six races in each meeting. Before each meeting, each player is required to enter one horse in each race. Then, before each race, you are presented with the list of entrants, including their previous form, the weight of the jockey, and the bookies' odds on each horse winning. Each player must then choose a horse to bet on.
