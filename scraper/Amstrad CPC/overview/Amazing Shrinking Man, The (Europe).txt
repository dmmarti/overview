Professor Nitro has put a potion in it that allows the reduction of living cells. But, by mistake, he swallows his preparation and becomes so small that he falls into the trash! That's the whole story. How can you help him get out of there? Finding the pieces of his antidote formula and the ingredients that compose it. The whole screen is dotted with apple stones, various flasks, ants, papers and flies! (Yes, some laboratories are not always as clean as we want to say!). Our little teacher walks through this maze (too quickly) and must avoid the critters and the acid. When all the pieces of formula are gathered, you will be entitled to the following table, the laboratory. But before, you will have time to make a few blisters to your hands with your joystick. Good courage!
