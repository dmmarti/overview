	A multi-player, multi-level labyrinth/maze game in the genre of Gauntlet; originally an arcade game. Players take the role of Kevin, who is trying to rescue his friends from their jail cells. As prisoners are released, they will attempt to follow Kevin, and also attack nearby enemies. Kevin's goal is to lead each prisoner to the exit, and onto the next level. Some levels have hidden passages which lead to bonus/secret levels.    As with any Gauntlet-style game, finding enough keys to deal with each door is crucial.  Kevin can pick up weapons such as grenades and boomerangs,  and other enhancing objects such as faster movement, a smart-bomb diamond, and other bonus objects for points.
