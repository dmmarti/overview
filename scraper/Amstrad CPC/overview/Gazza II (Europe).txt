	In the game inspired by legendary English footballer Paul 'Gazza' Gascoigne, you play matches with your favourite international team.. Moving in eight directions on a side-scrolling pitch, you also can control the power of your kick. Teams you choose are different in difficulty - Brazil is more powerful team then Albania. But you can't play in Premier League or a knockout championship. Two human players can play against each other, although only one can use a joystick on some versions.
