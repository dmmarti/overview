The Key Factor is an arcade game combined with a typing tutor. The player's task is to defend his planet from a force of alien invaders. Aliens appear at the top of the screen and slowly descend towards the bottom. Beneath every row of aliens are different letters, number or other keys. These are the player's guns and are shot when the corresponding key is pressed. The keys are protected by barriers that are weakened every time they are hit by aliens. If a barrier is completely destroyed the alien will reach the key which will lead to a game over for the player. The game consists of six levels each with a number of waves with different aliens that gets increasingly faster.
