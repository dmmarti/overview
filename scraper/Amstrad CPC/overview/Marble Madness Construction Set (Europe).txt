	Marble Madness involved guiding a ball through precarious levels with drops, ramps, and enemies to avoid for fear of losing time or being sent back to the start of a screen. The initial home licensing was split is Electronic Arts converted the arcade game itself to several systems, whilst Melbourne House provided their own level set, but more significantly designed an environment allowing players to create their own levels.    Angled and slanted ramps can be placed anywhere, either on a blank screen or to edit an existing level. Enemies can be placed anywhere, these will follow their own paths once you play the game. Time / points bonuses and oil slicks can also be added to the levels. A complete block of levels can be saved to create a game set of its own. Designs can be tested out before being committed to storage.
