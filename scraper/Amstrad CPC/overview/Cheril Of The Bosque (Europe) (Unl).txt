In the Badajoz jungle lives Cheril, a common girl, just like every other girl of her age. She eats cucumbers, hunts panthers with her bare teeth, flys around using hanging vines and dresses with suggestive animal furs. Nothing out of the blue. But Cheril, niece in second degree of Tartan, the scottish of the apes, has higher expectations. She's fed up with Eleuterio, the ever serious monkey, which condemns her explosions of crazy and espontaneous youthness, with the lewd stares from Mondongo the aborigin and his cousin Mojinganga, and with those damned snakes which ambush her from behind every bush in the jungle. She want's something better. She's decided to go to the city and become part of the ?beautiful people?, just like her ancestor Tarz√°n of the Apes, which went to London and wore a nice Tuxedo.

In fact, Cheril may leave whenever she's arsed to go, but the journey is long: thirteen days on foot, so she needs to provide herself with enough food. She estimates that a giant nut a day will suffice, so that means that she needs to collect thirteen giant nuts before leaving. Go for it!
