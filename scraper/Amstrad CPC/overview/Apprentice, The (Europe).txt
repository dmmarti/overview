Come tender novice, your skill to try at this the game to end all games.

But Caution.  If by chance the apprentice die then bid farewell to friends and fame.

Save the apprentice from his blundering spell!  Steer him round pernicious pitfalls, through concealed exits!  Does disaster await the apprentice?  Play it and see!

You, oh feeble trainee wizard, have totally messed up your studies.  In a vain attempt to make up for lost time you start playing with old incantations which catapult you into the maze - a real occult assault course.  The only way to escape is to collect 10 magic power rings from 10 wizard examiners.  Only then will you be allowed to reverse the incantation.
