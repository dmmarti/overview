This is essentially a cut-down budget version of Code Masters' earlier full-price release Jet Bike Simulator. There are still two difficulty levels, but now there is only one set of courses in each difficulty level (lakes for the easy level, and docks for the hard level). The only other differences are that the digitised speech has been re-recorded using a female voice, and the order of the courses on the hard difficulty level has been rearranged. Everything else about the game remains identical to Jet Bike Simulator
