	In this stage coach game you control two characters (in one player mode, in two player mode you can choose your character), the rider of the stage coach and the man on top of the stage coach, the riffle man.    A new stage coach service has been set up by Wells and Fargo. And it is your job to protect the transported cargo. The stage coach route goes through hostile territories and it is full of hazards.    You have to keep the stage coach on the road (as the stage coach rider) and shoot hostile hazards (as the man with the riffle).
