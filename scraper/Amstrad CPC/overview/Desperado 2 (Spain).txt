	In Desperado 2, the sequel to Gun.Smoke, the player is Marshall James, a sheriff sent by the State of Texas to restore order to the corrupt and violent town of Devil Stone.    The game is divided into two parts. The first one is a side-scrolling run'n gun game in the style of Sunset Riders. The second part is set in a saloon, and is a first-person shooting game like the Lethal Enforcers games.
