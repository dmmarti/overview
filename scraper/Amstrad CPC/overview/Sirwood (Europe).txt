	The dark magician Amargol has stolen the magic golden shield from the Nargoot village. The player, as Arn, a courageous shepherd, must recover the shield before four days have passed. Otherwise the power of the shield will be taken by Amargol.    Sirwood is a side-scrolling action game with a few adventure elements. Along three stages (the forest, the caves and the Amargol's castle), the player must destroy all the enemies and finally, recover the golden shield.
