Coloric is a puzzle game played on a 7x10 grid of boxes. Each box has a colour and the objective of the game is to change all the boxes into a single specific colour. This is done by simply moving a cursor over the grid and the colours will automatically change. A grid is however not allowed to change to black and if it does the game will end. This means that the player has to avoid moving over the boxes whose colour transforms into black. On the right side of the screen is a chart that shows how colours will be changed when moved over. To make things more challenging the chart changes over time and it's necessary to keep track of the changes. There is also a time limit that each level has to be completed within.
