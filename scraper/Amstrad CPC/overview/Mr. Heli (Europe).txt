	It is 2999 and Mr Muddy threatens your planet. Fortunately you have a fully armed large helicopter with which to attack his sadistic minions. You hop aboard and fly through four side-view levels, primiarly scrolling left to right but with some variant, each of which ends with a boss.    As well as enemies, there are many blocks on the levels. The weapon upgrade system is build into these, which function in two different ways. Most will drop crystals, which if collected are added to your cash total. The others reveal a picture of a weapon with a price - make contact with it while carrying enough credits and you will buy this weapon. When your energy bar runs out you lose a life; when this happens you lose all your money.
