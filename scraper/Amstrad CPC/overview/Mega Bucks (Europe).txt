	A teenager inherits a mansion from his uncle Maxabillion Brainbox III, within which is hidden his vast fortune. In this flip screen adventure (similar to the "Magic Knight" series) our hero must search the sprawling mansion before his time limit runs out and a bizarre security system locks down the Mansion for good. The house and it's grounds have been littered with clues and puzzles by the lad's uncle, creating the worlds biggest treasure hunt. To find the hidden fortune the prospective billionaire has to creatively use the items that litter the mansion, from tape recorders to fire extinguishers, garden shears to a sick budgie and and leave the mansion with Mega-bucks.
