The city is overrun with muggers and gun-toting criminals, and you're determined to clean the streets and get rid of them. You'll need to obtain a gun to fend off the criminals, but the bins are booby-trapped and will explode if they hit something when you push them! Lying around the city, and in some of these bins, are sacks of money and briefcases containing drugs, which you need to return to the bank in order to claim a reward and score points.
