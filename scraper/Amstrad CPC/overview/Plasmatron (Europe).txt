Command has sent you to explore what you thought was a deserted empire colony. Unfortunately, they questioned your loyalty and had sent you to Loughton 2, a heavily defended alien world instead. In this shooter, pilot your Plasmatron fighter using the keyboard or Joystick. By dodging and maneuvering to avoid any damage, destroy the oncoming barrage of missiles and enemy fighters. The more you destroy, the better chance of getting the high score with your name displayed next to it. On those long missions, by hitting the 'F' key, you can freeze the game temporarily.
