K.Y.A. (Keep Yourself Alive) is an action game, representing a confrontation between Blue and Red players. Escaping through ten caves, the players should fight with each other and with various droids to become a one of their masters. Each player controls his pod and shoots the opponents, other droids, and destructible walls after recharging. Some walls are charging the pod, some are discharging it. Each pod should defeat his opponent five times in the cave to proceed to the next cave. A special encounter with "The Crusher" droid is taking place between each cave transition, and it should be defeated a gradually increased number of times. 

A cave editor included in the game allows to create new caves or save / load the existed caves. A training mode can be used to select a better tactics for a certain cave. Cave design is absolutely different for Amstrad and Thomson versions.
