This game is the first in Artic's Adventure series. You play the role of a spaceship pilot in the future who has been marooned on a hostile alien planet and must find his spaceship and fix it to escape. To hinder your progress are fiendish puzzles and a handful of alien NPCs .    The interface is purely text driven and there are no illustrations of the rooms that you are in. The text parser uses simple Verb/Noun for commands.
