Five pulsies were trapped in a maze (49 screens each) and the player, as a pulsator, has to rescue them. The basic goal of each maze is to reach the pulsie, but of course there are many obstacles in the way, most prominently numbered doors which are opened or closed by rolling over the associated sensor. Other examples are one-use sensors which reverse the status of each electric door, prison doors which have to be opened with keys, unhealthy electric pads or one-way passages. Enemies try to stop the player and lower the energy bar when their attacks are successful, but a pistol offers a way to get rid of them. A shield extra grants invulnerability and the deadly touch for 30 seconds.
