	Ted is an enthusiastic worker at a computer chip factory, which takes the form of dozens of hazardous platform screens, most of which lead to more than 2 other rooms, through holes in the floor and ceiling as well as a lift. Each room is littered with moving sprites as well as lava pits and dangerous drops, all of which will drain the energy from Ted's single life.    Ted has 21 tasks to complete in this 8 1/2 hour-day, but it is largely up to him to find out what they are, and which order to do them in. The full day includes trips to the canteen, photocopier, power generator and the boss' office - logic will give you clues as to when these are to be accomplished.    He knows that solving one problem can change the nature of another, due to the program's advanced Event Processing. In each room, two flashing boxes must be hit, sometimes within a time limit, and Ted knows the location of the first few of these. On the technical side the game promises a full uninterrupted soundtrack and super-smooth animation.
