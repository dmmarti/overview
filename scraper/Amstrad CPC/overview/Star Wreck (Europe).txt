Star Wreck is a single player text adventure game with graphics that is a parody of the television series Star Trek. The player takes the role of Captain James T. Cake of the starship Paralysed. The mission is to travel to the planet Dandrox and deliver a Trell and a Rigellian Slime beast who are needed there for experimental purposes. On board there is the Thracian ambassador to Dandrox.and a Krall who's travelling elsewhere. The ship starts falling apart as the game progresses and a number of the puzzles are based on resolving these problems in order to reach the destination. The game is entirely keyboard controlled. The text parser claims a vocabulary of over one hundred words including energise, taste, stroke, kiss and reverse.
