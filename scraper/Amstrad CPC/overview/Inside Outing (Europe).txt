Lady Crutcher's rich husband died recently, and he hid twelve diamonds within his mansion ? but he never told his wife where they were located. Lady Crutcher would like to know where all the diamonds are hidden, so she employs someone to help her find them. You can only carry one diamond at a time, and each diamond has to be brought to Lady Crutcher. Her husband was also a scientist, and some of his creations ? giant mice and canaries ? roam the rooms and will deplete your energy upon contact with them, although they can be stopped in their tracks if you find the right objects.
