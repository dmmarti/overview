Heliot is a fixed screen shoot 'em up that takes place during the prohibition era. The player controls an armed man, supposedly a gangster, who can walk left and right down the bottom of the screen while shooting at the enemies above him. The enemies, which are represented by icons of objects of the era (such as tommy guns, beer mugs, cars etc.), move back and forth according to certain patterns while dropping projectiles that the player character has to avoid. Each type of enemy has its own movement pattern. The player getting hit will lead to a lost life and when all four lives are gone the game is over. An extra life is given for every 2000 points earned. Before starting out there are five difficulty levels to choose from.
