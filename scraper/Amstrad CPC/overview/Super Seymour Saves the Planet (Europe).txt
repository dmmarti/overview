	In the sequel to Seymour Goes to Hollywood, Seymour takes on his first movie role - as an eco-friendly superhero. With game design showing some obvious influence from Bomb Jack, Seymour jumps around a series of single screen areas collecting barrels of toxic waste. One barrel at a time is highlighted and is worth more points than the others, but will explode after a short countdown. Seymour is plagued by mutants which fly and bounce around the screen. Some must be jumped on from above, some must be hit from below.
