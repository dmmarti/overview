Nova follows a similar premise as Deflector, that is, the player has to manipulate one or or more beams of light in such a way that they reach a certain spot. This can be done by placing tiles on the playing field. There are tiles that change the direction of a beam by 90 degrees, blocks that cannot be penetrated, blocks that are destroyed by the light and slow it down for a moment, tubes that allow the light to pass through itself and bubbles that break the light and send it off into two different directions. The type of tiles available and the total number of tiles the player is allowed to use differs from level to level.
