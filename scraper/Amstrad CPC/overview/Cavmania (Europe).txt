Ug the caveman is intent on stealing some pterodactyl eggs, and he has to collect three of them. However, he can only carry one at a time, and he mustn't drop it on his way back to the cave! And then there's the prehistoric monsters to watch out for as well... There are nine islands in total, and in between each island, there's a two-screen bonus level where you collect wheels.
