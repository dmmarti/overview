Presented by the name of snooker's World Champion Alex Higgins, the game is a snooker simulator with top-down view of the table. In the beginning of the game, the player places the cue ball in fixed position on the table. To give it a direction, the cue ball's image is placed in the desired destination's position. Adjusting the force and spin, the player gives a movement to the cue ball. The coloured and/or numbered balls should be put in pockets in a predefined order according to the rules of snooker. The one with the most points at the end of a game wins.

The packs of red balls come in variations of six, ten or fifteen. There are two game modes: practice for one player and match for two players. The game is available in English, French, and German languages.
