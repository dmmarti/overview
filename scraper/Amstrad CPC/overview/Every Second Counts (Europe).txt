	Every Second Counts is a computer game based on the popular UK television show of the 1980's.    This is a quiz show game for either three couples or six individuals, single players compete with a computer partner, where contestants compete to win seconds, not points. The player with the most seconds takes part in the final round where those seconds are the time they have available to compete.  There are six blocks of questions so the game can be played six times before some categories come up a second time.  The game consists of -    1. Round 1- True or False  This round consists of nine True / False questions. Player 1 from each team takes it in turn to answer a question. A correct answer gains the player's team two points, an incorrect answer scores nothing and knocks the team out of this round. Play continues until all questions have been asked or until there is only one team remaining.  2. Round 2- True or False  This round is identical to the previous round and is played by Player 2 from each team  3. General Knowledge Bonus Round  Both team members play in this round.

Round 3- True or False  This round is identical to Round 1 with four points for a correct answer  5. Round 4- True or False  This round is identical to Round 2 with four points for a correct answer  6.
