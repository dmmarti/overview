Risk is a turn-based strategy game based on the board game of the same name. The players participate in a virtual world conquest: each player chooses a country to control, with the goal of engaging in war against the other countries, eventually dominating the whole world. The players are able to draft troops, build armies, move them on the map, and fortify their positions. Dice rolls are absent from the game; the victory depends on the player's actions more than on luck.
