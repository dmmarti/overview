MURI is a game inspired by late '80s and early '90s DOS platformers. You play as Adwoa, a woman in a robot suit, on a quest to find out what happened to humanity after the vanishing of Mars. The game features four episodes with five levels each and four difficulty settings. You can also choose between classic choppy screen movement or a more modern and smooth one. The game features various different weapons and a life system but saving the game is not possible.
