Everyone should know about sudoku, the puzzle game in which you must fill a 9×9 grid, ensuring that each number from 1 to 9 appears only once in each row, column and 3×3 block. You can choose to play either a randomly generated puzzle from one of four difficulty levels, or attempt the "128 level challenge", and if you somehow manage to solve all 128 levels, you really can crown yourself a Sudoku Master!
