	When a person reaches elevated levels of popularity, the eager eyes of some programmers nail in him, and with these lucid minds they begin to emanate ideas that end up materializing into a program, or at least a commercial. This is the case with this Italian youngster singer of overwhelming personality that enters by the hand of Iber Soft to the world of videogames.    The game develops the eventful journeys that a popular singer -Sabrina- must suffer to be able to be transferred from the airport to the nearest television studios. In order to arrive there, she must cross a town whose inhabitants seem to be a little dis-conformed with their way to be, to act and, mainly, to dress.    Your mission will be to guide Sabrina in this arduous way, avoiding or eliminating as more as possible enemies. They are of several kinds, although all of them have an aspect in common- they are normal and current people of whom you can be found in the street to dozens. Thus, for example, the typical housewives, the knifer, the aggressive punkie, the exorcist priest, the old woman with her indispensable cane and a long list of others of citizen tipisms.
