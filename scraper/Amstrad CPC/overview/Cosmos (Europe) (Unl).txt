In Cosmos the player has to protect convoys from alien attackers. Although entirely two dimensional it's played from a first person perspective with the player moving a crosshair over the screen and shooting at the enemies as they attempt to attack the convoy. The convoy consists of nine ships and is located in the middle of the screen although it's possible to scroll the view in all directions. Enemy ships will spawn around the convoy and head right for it and destroy one of it's ships upon contact. The player's job is simply to stop them from doing this by shooting them down. Once all aliens have been killed a new wave appears and the player gets another convoy to protect. The aliens also drop deadly warp mines as they attack. These have to be avoided as the player loses a life when moving the crosshair over one. The game is over when four lives have been lost or when all ships in the convoy have been destroyed. The Spectrum version also has asteroids that drift toward the convoy which the player also has to destroy.
