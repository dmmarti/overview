New York in 2017 is overrun with criminals, and you have decided to rid the city of them once and for all. Each level consists of a section of the city which can be scrolled horizontally. Every so often, one or more criminals will appear from a window, manhole or car and fire their weapons at you, and you must aim your crosshairs at them and retaliate. If you're shot too many times, the game is over.
