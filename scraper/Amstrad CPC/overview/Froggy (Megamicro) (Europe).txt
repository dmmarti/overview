Froggy is inspired by the arcade game Frogger where you have to get a frog home across three separate screens in this top view game. Starting at the bottom of the first screen, you have to cross a busy road by moving your frog forwards, backwards, left or right trying to avoid traffic moving across the screen left or right, to reach the top of the screen. The next screen sees you try to cross a jungle with various creatures once again moving across the screen before trying to cross a river. You have to swim across the river from a bank but the current keeps dragging you to the right as you try to reach a lily pad. Once you make it to your home, you then repeat the game but at a higher skill level. If you touch any creature then you lose one of three lives and you are sent back to the first screen.
