	With full graphics throughout, Heavy on the Magick aimed the standard adventure style at a wider audience. Axil the Able is stuck in Collodon's pile, and he must find a way out. At the start, the game will randomly generate his Skill, Stamina and Luck - you can regenerate these if you don't like the initial values. As you play your experience statistic will increase.    The graphics are created in memory before being copied onto the screen; this causes some pixellated areas, but there's a full examine option with some helpful hints as to the item's benefit/risk.    The lair is on many levels, and most rooms have multiple exits across the 8 compass directions. Vampires and Werewolves are among the many creatures which guard the corridors - you use magic to kill or freeze these, although some can be beaten back by possessing certain objects.
