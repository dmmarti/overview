A spaceship has been overrun by aliens, and you have been sent on board to find twelve flashing blue crystals. There are 96 rooms to explore, and you must navigate platforms and stairs and dodge aliens in your search for the crystals. You will often find your way blocked by barriers which can only be moved by finding the corresponding switch. Flashing stars can also be collected for extra points, and you'll also need to collect oxygen cylinders to replenish your supply. Once you've found all twelve crystals, you must go to a particular room in the spaceship and insert them into some slots, and then it's a race against time back to the airlock where you originally entered!
