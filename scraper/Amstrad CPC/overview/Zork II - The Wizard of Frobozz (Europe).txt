Zork II: The Wizard of Frobozz is a text adventure, a sequel to the classic first Zork. Once again, the game is set in the Great Underground Empire, but this time the main goal is to face off against the titular Wizard. Like its predecessor, Zork II plays like any other text adventure: there are no graphics - only text - and the player types commands such as lift cage or examine robot.
