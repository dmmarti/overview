Dempsey and Makepeace is a licensed game based on the British television series with the same name. The player takes control of Dempsey who has two hours to locate and rescue his partner Makepeace who has been captured and is held somewhere in London. To find clues about here whereabouts he has to explore various buildings around the city. This is done from a third person perspective and the player can interact with the environment through an icon based interface which is used to examine, pick up and use objects. There is also an inventory icon as well as a phone that can be used to telephone clues back to Spikings. Upon doing so the player's score increases. In addition to finding Makepeace there are three other crimes to solve.

Sometimes the player will come across armed criminals and the game then starts an action sequence where Dempsey is controlled from a top down perspective and can attempt to shoot the enemy. The game also involves driving sequences where the player steers his car from one building to another. Crashing the car will lead to a loss of time since Dempsey has to find a new one.
