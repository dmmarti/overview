It's your own fault being trapped in this cellar. You ignored your wives warnings not to walk in the woods near your house as a witch is believed to live in them. When the mist came in you walked around for hours lost until you stumbled across a house where an old lady lives. When you are invited into the house and you enter you realised you had found the witch. When she placed her hat on her head she disappeared leaving the hat behind and with no way to return home you did the same. You now have to escape the cellar and find your way home. Witch Hunt is a text only adventure with each screen describing your location as you type in your commands.
