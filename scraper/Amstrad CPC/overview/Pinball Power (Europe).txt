Nearly all pinball games on the CPC show a top-down view of the pinball table. However, this one (also known as 3D Pinball) dares to be different, by showing you a perspective view of the table, the way you would see it if you were playing a real pinball machine. This level of realism is maintained when you start playing the game; the ball moves really fast, and you'll need to be alert!
