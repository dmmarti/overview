	Survivor is a platform game in which you take the uncomfortable role of the "bad one". This time, you will be a ruthless alien wandering around in a gigantic spaceship which contains the last vestiges of the species which once extended thorough the entire Universe. Unfortunately for these species, Survivor (you) wants his race to be the only existing one.    With such an evil purpose, you will move in different zones of the spaceship erasing all the species you encounter , including their babies. Your main weapon to do so will be a recalcitrant liquid, which you will be able to throw from your mouth. You are, however not immortal, and in order to recharge you energy you will have to eat some humans.
