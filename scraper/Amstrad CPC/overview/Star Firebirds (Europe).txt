	The Star Firebirds are a dangerous alien race which must be wiped out before they can attack your people. This makes for a shoot 'em up with your ship at the bottom of the screen, shooting upwards as it dodges the Firebirds as they shoot down the screen. To clear each of the 64 waves you must destroy a set amount of each of the two types of Firebirds.     You have a standard cannon as well as a hyperspace super-move, which can wipe out several Firebirds at once. Each wave finishes with a super-baddy to be shot several times in between its efforts at raining shots down on you.
