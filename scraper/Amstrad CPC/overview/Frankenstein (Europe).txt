You have been sent to the surrounding areas to look for and bring back bodies and special equipment needed. All this needs to be done before a great electrical storms starts in 30 minutes or it's curtains for Egor. The game is a flick-screen platform game and you need to navigate the platforms and various locations to find the items needed. As you search the locations there are various creatures moving about and if they are touched then this increases Egor's fear meter and when this is full then you lose one of seven lives. Once an item needed is found then Egor must take it back to the Baron but if you lose a life then you lose the item.
