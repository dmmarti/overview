Corruption is one of Magnetic Scrolls' interactive fiction games. The player takes control of a stockbroker on the fast track to riches. Suddenly, there are attempts on his life, with the words 'insider dealings' floating around. The hero is framed for a crime he didn't commit, and must prove his innocence before it is too late. The game is a text adventure with graphics; the player inputs verb commands to interact with the environment and advance the story. The gameplay focuses on realistic investigation and information-gathering rather than puzzle-solving.
