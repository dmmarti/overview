Zarkon is a top view horizontal shooter where the screen scrolls left to right constantly as you attempt to get your spacecraft through eight heavily defended Galaxies. As you move through each Galaxy, there are various alien ships that fly around the screen and these must be blasted or avoided, as well as ground defences and if you hit an alien, ground defence or are shot then you lose one of three lives.
