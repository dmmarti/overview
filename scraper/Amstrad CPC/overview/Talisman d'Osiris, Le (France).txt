The Talisman of Osiris is a sacred artefact that bestows magical powers upon whoever possesses it, and secret agent Karl Adrix has been sent to explore the catacombs beneath the pyramids and retrieve it, but in order to enter the room where it is located, he must obtain four jewels and place them next to statues of the gods to appease them. Once all the jewels are placed correctly, he will receive the key to open the chamber where the mythical talisman is located.
