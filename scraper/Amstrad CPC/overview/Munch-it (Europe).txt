Munch It is based on the arcade game Pac-Man where you have to move around a top view single screen maze and eat all the dots. While your eating the dots, there are three ghosts moving around the maze looking to kill you. If you touch a ghost then you lose one of three lives. In the four corners of the maze are power-pills and when eaten allow you to chase and eat the ghosts for a short time. Before the game starts you can select a skill level (1-4).
