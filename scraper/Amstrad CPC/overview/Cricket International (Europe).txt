Although then a successful cricket player, Robin Smith licensed a management game. Playing against the computer, you can play a single match or a series of 3 or 5 one-day matches, as one of the top 7 international sides. These matches can be anywhere between 40 and 60 overs per side in length. First you select your team off 11 based on their battling, bowling and wicket-keeping abilities. A coin toss decides who bats first, after which you choose your tactics for the upcoming over, based on weather and wicket conditions. The bowling side has 9 field layouts to choose from. The action is represented from a top-down view of the whole field, with a running commentary as to the results of each stroke, showing what type of shot was played, who fielded the ball, and how many runs were scored.
