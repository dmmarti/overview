A nonogram (also better known as Picross) is a puzzle where you have to fill in a grid of cells, based on a set of numbers listed beside each grid, which represent the number of filled squares in that row or column. Each grid consists of 16 rows and 16 columns, and each puzzle must be completed within a set time limit. Incorrectly marking any square as filled results in a severe time penalty, so it is advisable not to guess!
