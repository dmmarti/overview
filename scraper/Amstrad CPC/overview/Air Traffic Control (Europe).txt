 Take control of air traffic over central Italy's sky. Place up to eight flights and guide them to a safe landing. The game takes place in the Lazio region where you can choose between two Roman airports, Fiumicino (FCO) and Ciampino (CIA). The aim is to control the airport's airspace and the player should amongst other things assign flights ID's and have them alter speed, altitude and direction to keep them from crashing into each other.
