	Dustin,s life of crime has caught up with him; he,s been incarcerated in the high-security WADRAS prison. In this arcade adventure, it is your job to get him out, within three hours. Getting into fight with guards, or spending too long in the restricted areas to the north, incurs a twenty-minute penalty and returns you to the opening room.    The task involves avoiding guards and manipulating valuable objects. The prison is split into three horizontal corridors, each with many rooms containing prisoners. The player can often trade objects with these prisoners, or simply beat them up instead. Once outside you can escape into safety, by crossing a ditch and then navigating a harsh rural area. The game is viewed from a forced perspective, which takes on a 3D effect while outdoors in the open.
