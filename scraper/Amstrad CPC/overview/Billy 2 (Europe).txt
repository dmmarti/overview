In this sequel to Billy la Banlieue the player takes on the role of RockaBilly, who wears black jacket, black sunglasses, earring, blue bandanna, and usually move around the streets with the purpose of playing new video games. Again, the streets are full of thugs preventing RockaBilly from reaching his favorite video game machines. Now RockaBilly has to fight with them using hands and legs (instead of the tools available in the predecessor), take their money, and use this money in the video game machines. The video games are new and represent classical Trampoline Jumping and Cowboy Shooting games.
