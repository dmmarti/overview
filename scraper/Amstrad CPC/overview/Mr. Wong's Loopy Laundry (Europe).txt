Help Mr. Wong run his laundry by negotiating the platforms and ladders, collecting the dirty clothes, and throwing them down the chute to be washed. However, it's not that easy, because Mr. Wong is constantly being chased by a possessed iron, a sack of dirty laundry, and a cluster of soap bubbles. Fortunately, he can fire starch at the enemies to freeze them temporarily, but his supplies are limited, so it must be used sparingly.
