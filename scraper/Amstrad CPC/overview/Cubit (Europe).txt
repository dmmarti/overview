Cubit is a 3D puzzle game where the player must arrange cubes into proper configurations, as seen from the front, top, and side perspectives. Each perspective has a grid of cells, which could be blank, or contain a number from 1 through 4. The player's goal is to arrange the cubes so that any numbered cell borders an equal number of cubes, when viewed from that cell's perspective. The game has 100 levels of increasing complexity, and contains Twitter integration, allowing players who have beaten a level to post that fact online.
