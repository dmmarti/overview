Nanako thought that her life would be easy after she rescued her younger sister from the Monster Castle, but as soon as she got to her home village, she met the evil Yh贸p-Uthas wreaking havoc and destroying everything? again. And when the Yh贸p-Uthas were not busy breaking necks and burning houses, the Kah-Vronn-Azhos were, or the  Tuj-Muer-Tso-Ts贸, or even the Myby Ka-Gahn-T贸? Nobody seemed to take Nanako?s village seriously, so Nanako decided that the situation had to change.

The first thing Nanako did was getting incredibly angry and stomp forcefully her feet against the floor but, as such relieving action didn't solve a thing, she decided to go see the Oracle. The guy, of inmense wisdom, advised her to go to Hell to look for 4 pieces of an ancient artifact which would turn to ashes any offender tribe which would attack the village. Nanako didn't find that strange at all (we all know that in Hell you can find such kind of things), so she took her way down to Hell!
