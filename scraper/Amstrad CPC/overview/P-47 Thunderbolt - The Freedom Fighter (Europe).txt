The P-47 Thunderbolt was one of the most famous fighter planes of World War II, and now you're on a bombing mission in one of them. In each level, you fly from left to right and take out waves of enemy fighters, before coming face to face with an end-of-level guardian, usually a train, a large plane, or even a battleship! Shooting helicopters also reveals either additional weaponry or an extra life.
