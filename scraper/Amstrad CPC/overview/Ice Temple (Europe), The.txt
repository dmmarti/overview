	Nick Razor's pride and joy was his brand new 'Hot Hatchback' Space Cruiser.  He had spent all his last salary cheque, earned as a galactic dust man, on buying it.  Then it is stolen and the careless thieves press the hyperspace button by accident.    Nick traces his 'wheels' to the remote Ice Temple and discovers that, far from being the innocent entertainment centre it claims, the building is a thermionic reactor being controlled by aliens to remove the planet's energy.    The whole planet is cooling down at such a rapid rate that it is turning into an icy waste and the Aliens are using the energy to fuel rocket warships destined to conquer the Earth.    In order to destroy the dastardly plan Nick must remove all eight pieces of the reactor and dump them down the refuse-crusher chutes.  It's not going to be easy and will use all Nick's past working experience but Nick is mankind's only hope!
