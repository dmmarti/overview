Just as when Microdeal's mascot Cuthbert Goes Digging, when Amsoft's mascot Roland starts digging, he does it in a Space Panic clone. The story goes that Roland works at a building site that has been invaded by plant aliens that consume all air, and Roland seizes the opportunity to gain a princely bonus by eradicating the aliens.

In a fashion similar to Lode Runner, Roland must climb the platforms, dig holes for the aliens to fall into, and then hit them on the head with his shovel to put them out of action. If a hole isn't wide enough, the alien will climb out of it, and will now be nearly unstoppable. All the while, the air is being depleted, and the remaining air when all aliens are gone counts towards Roland's bonus.
