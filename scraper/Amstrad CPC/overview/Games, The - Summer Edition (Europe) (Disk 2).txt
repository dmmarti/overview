	You start as a member of the 1988 U.S. Olympic Team to compete at the Olympic Summer Games.    You can play eight events, including Velodrome Sprint Cycling, Hurdles, Pole Vault, Hammer-throw, Uneven Parallel Bars, Rings, Archery, and Springboard Diving. You can practice each event separately or play the whole competition.    The game also features a multiple player option, this makes it a nice party game. If you are alone, you can compete against the computer.    If you're stuck in an event, or want to get better, just take the coaching book (= the manual) and read how you can make more tricks. It also features many real facts of the history of the Olympic summer games.
