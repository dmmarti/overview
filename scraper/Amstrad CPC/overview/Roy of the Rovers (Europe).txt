There is a charity football match to be played to save Melchester Rovers' ground but oh no the team has been kidnapped. The mighty Roy Race is the only man to save them and the ground. Roy must walk round Melchester to find them. In his way are opposition supporters, holigans and heavies. If you manage to find any players then you play the actual match. If you don't find any of them then the bulldozers move in.
