Deep in the centre of the earth is a network of rooms where life-bearing cells are generated. However, a hacker has altered the programming of these cells, and it is your mission to restore the programming to its normal state. On each of the many screens, a cell is generated at the yellow door and bounces off walls and tiles towards the red door ? the door of evil. You have to move the arrow tiles so that the cell is guided towards the green door ? the door of life. You have a magnetic key that can be dropped in order to move the tiles, but watch out for the robots!
