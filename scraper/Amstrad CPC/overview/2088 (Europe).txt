 2088 is a 2D top-down shooter set in the future. The player controls the gunfighter, and starts in the centre of the screen. He must catch the green things, and destroy enemies, for example saucers, exploding pods or space snakes. The game is played on a small stage. Laser bolts are outside the arena, and the player must avoid their shots. After passing the arena, the player gets in a spaceship and flies through the field of meteorites.
