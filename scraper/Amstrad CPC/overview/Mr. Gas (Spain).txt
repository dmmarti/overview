Mr. Gas is a bubble who was destined to enjoy life in a bottle of cava (a type of Spanish sparkling wine). But he's trapped inside a soda water factory and will end up inside a soda water bottle instead! This cannot be allowed to happen, so Mr. Gas must escape. The only way out of the factory is a pipe, but it's blocked, and you must roam the factory and search for the four objects that are required to turn the rusty tap that opens the gateway to freedom, while avoiding the energy-sapping crabs, birds, robots and ventilation shafts.
