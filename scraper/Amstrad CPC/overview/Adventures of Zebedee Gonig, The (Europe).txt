A strange tale indeed adventurers! It goes something like this: You are Zebedee Gonig, unemployed gibbet entrepreneur. Having just returned from a 9 month vacation (or drying out period) due to the over indulgence on the demon drink! You recall the golden days when a gibbet like yourself could have such strange titles as EMPLOYED, WORKING or TAXPAYERS ELBOW, however today was different, probably because of the rumor about the elusive "Poll Tax Enforcer" tribe, mercenary from Burnley. Zebedee mused over this on the first day back home.
