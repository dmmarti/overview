TT Racer is a motorcycle game motor cycle racing simulation.

This game is all about racing bikes around grand prix circuits. There are twelve circuits to choose from and each can be tackled on a variety of class of bike and difficulty settings. Races can be a full season, in which case the game will take the player through all tracks in the correct order, or a single race in which case the player(s) select the track they want. Each race consists of up to 15 other bikes and as this is a simulation, pit stops for refuelling and tyre changing is catered for as well.
