You have been woken too late from suspended animation to save your ship from crashing on a strange planet. Now it is up to you to save your fellow crew members by finding replacement Plasma Pods and getting of this hostile planet. You fly around in your spacepod over the planets surface and in underground tunnels trying to find the pods. There are various droids and obstacles trying to destroy you and your ship but you can kill them with your blaster. In the main ship you have access to a onboard computer to help you.
