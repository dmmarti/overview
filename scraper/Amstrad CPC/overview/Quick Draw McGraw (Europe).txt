Quick Draw McGraw is a side-view horizontal scrolling game based on the Hanna Barbera cartoon character where the screen scrolls constantly from right to left. You control Quick Draw whose mission is to protect various trains from being attacked and robbed by various characters, by running along the top or by the side of the carriages of each train to reach the engine at the front. As you run and shoot or avoid the characters you must also jump the gaps to avoid falling onto the ground but the gaps can be used to get to the lower part of the train. If you hit the ground then you keep running along side but can't get back on the train or advance and when you touch the left of the screen then you have to attempt that train from the start again. As well as the characters there are obstacles to avoid like smoke and birds and if you touch an obstacle, character or are shot then you lose part of a gauge and when it is empty then it is game over. On various part of the train are carriages that can be entered, and this turns into a 1st person shooter where baddies or grannies appear and the baddies have to be shot before they shoot you or you lose part of your now full gauge. If you shoot a granny then you lose part of the gauge and when you shoot so many baddies then you go back to the top of the train again. When you reach the front engine then you must shoot while avoiding a large character and when shot enough allows you to go to the next train.
