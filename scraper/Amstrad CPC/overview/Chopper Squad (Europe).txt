Chopper Squad is loosely based on the Spectrum hit Jetpac You are in control of a chopper and must fly about the screen picking up bits of a plane Once you have a piece of the craft you must take it to the bottom right of the screen. There are four types of alien to contend with As you make progress by building planes then the aliens start to home in on you and the game gets harder To aid you m the task, you have been equipped with a rapid fire laser with which you can dispatch the aliens

Chopper Squad is a reasonably enjoyable game to play but the graphics and sound are so poor that it becomes boring rapidly.
