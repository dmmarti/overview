Crete 1941 is a wargame recreating operation Merkur, at that time the biggest airborne invasion, conducted by German paratroops (Fallschirmj√§ger) during the World War II. The player may also control Allied forces (Greek, British, Australian and New Zealand troops).

After the deployment phase the game lasts 28 turns: from the morning of 20th May to the night of 27th May 1941. There are options to make the game easier: wind drift affecting drop accuracy can be turned off, Allies may fail to intercept German supply convoys. The units consist of infantry, engineers, artillery, anti-tank and anti-aircraft guns (the latter effective against landing paratroops/gliders). They're characterized by morale, experience and cohesion (integrity, of special importance to paratroopers spread after the landing). Additionally, the German side has air support (recon, airstrikes), while the British field tanks. The (mostly hilly) terrain affects combat losses. The game takes into account (score) the historical evacuation of Allied forces.
