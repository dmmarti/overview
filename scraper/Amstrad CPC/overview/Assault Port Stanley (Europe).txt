The Falklands War of 1982 saw British forces retake the Falkland Islands after it was briefly occupied by Argentina, and this game is very loosely based on it. The game begins with you controlling a British warship and firing at enemy ships ? although you can't adjust the range of your gun. At any time, you can launch a helicopter, where you must dodge and shoot enemy planes. If you reach land before you run out of fuel, you must then fly your helicopter through a narrow channel and dodge even more enemies, while occasionally stopping at huts to collect troops and refuel.
