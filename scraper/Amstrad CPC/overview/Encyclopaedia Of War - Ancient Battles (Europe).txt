Designed to recreate the pitched battles in the world of antiquity, 'Ancient Battles' lets you command the armies of 'Julius Caeser', 'Alexander the Great', 'Hannibal' and 'Attila the Hun', in the great battles of the ancient world.

An 'easy to use' system allows players to design their own armies in a matter of minutes so that every game can be different.  Forces can be selected from those available to any one of 24 different nations.

The game comes with a number of preset scenarios and includes comprehensive 'Historical Notes' covering Battle Notes, Warfare in the Ancient World and Army Notes.
