When, at the end, he could gather a good amount of money and exited the Storm Palace, Uwol thought that he had finally succeeded. He began walking his way home, when he was suddenly hit by a Fanty guardian from inside the Palace and fell rolling down a very steep slope, only to end landing in the middle of Phantomas' Electric Garden. Besides, to top it all, during the fall he had lost EVERY coin he had just gathered from inside the Palace. Great. Stupendous. So much work, a full game, four ports to different systems, a lot of good reviews and awards? all for nothing.

Uwol, feeling completely downhearted, though that it would be O.K. if he just went accross the Electric Garden and returned home to keep pittying himself. Nevertheless, he soon discovered a bunch of mysterious pipes scattered accross the whole garden, and they looked just like those in the good ol' Super Mario Bros ? he were so much alike that they even leaded to obscure caves full of COINS!

Now the decision is yours: Will you just escape the Electric Gardens in the Storm Palace, o will you take your chance to gather as much coins as you can before leaving?
