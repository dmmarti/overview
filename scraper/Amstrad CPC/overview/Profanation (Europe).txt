You're a treasure hunter, exploring the Egyptian pyramids with no regard for the sanctity of the place (the name of the game means 'desecration' in English) and grabbing whatever treasures you can find. Naturally, there are lots of monsters which will kill you if you touch them; mummies, beetles, blobs of slime, and bats which home in on you very quickly.
