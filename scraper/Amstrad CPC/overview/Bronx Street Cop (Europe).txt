Life in the Bronx district of New York must be tough with all the muggings, robberies and other crimes that occur each day. You're a new recruit and have to show the bosses that you're the meanest cop around. The game starts with target practice where you must achieve a certain score; if you do this, you can go on to the streets and shoot criminals ? but don't shoot any grannies or you'll be disciplined!
