Stress is an adaptation of Pac-Man. You play a human-shaped white silhouetted sprite in a bland-looking square arena representing a room of a haunted house. Just as in Pac-Man, you collect a large amount of yellow dots (which are meant to represent gold coins), but that's where any similarities end. There is only a single white ghost chasing you and there is no grid or path that the ghost follows. In this game the enemy ghost just zooms straight for you.
