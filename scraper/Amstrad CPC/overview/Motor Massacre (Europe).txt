Dr. A. Noid has turned the Earth's inhabitants into zombies by feeding them with the addictive food substitute Slu. A reward has been offered to stop him, so you decide...to stop him. You must drive around three cities in your All-Terrain Vehicle (ATV) and explore buildings to find food, ammunition, extras for your ATV, and ultimately, a pass to enter the arena, where you participate in an all-out demolition derby and knock cars out of the arena. Survive this, and you can go to the next city.
