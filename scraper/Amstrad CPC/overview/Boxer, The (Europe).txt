Just imagine the fun you could have with a pugilist (look it up) of your own! Think of the money you could make if he was any good! In The Boxer, this is exactly the scenario you are presented with. You are a boxing manager with one promising lad in your care.

At the start of the game you set up his skills and abilities by allocating points for fitness, stamina, strength, morale and so on. Before each match you must train him in specific skills to raise these values.

Then you arrange a venue and an opponent. The opponents range from evil giants with sledgehammer fists to a stunted weakling with a punch like an enfeebled earthworm.
