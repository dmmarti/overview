The sequel to the classic Manic Miner, Jet Set Willy is another of those strange games where you jump around impossibly difficult screens and avoid weirdly abstract bad guys. The story behind this one is that, having just bought a mansion and had a huge house-warming party, his housekeeper won't let him into his bedroom until he gathers all the trinkets from around the mansion's grounds that his guests have scattered about. So instead of firing her on the spot, Willy sets out to do just that.
