Snide Gantree and his minions have overrun a military base in the South Pacific, and he has also managed to hack into the computers which control the missiles that are stored at the base. You have to fly around the base and collect documents that will prevent the missiles from being launched, although when you find a document, you have to complete a Tower of Hanoi-style game where you shift rings from one column to another.
