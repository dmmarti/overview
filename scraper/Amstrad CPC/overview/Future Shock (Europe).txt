42 billion years ago, the Supreme Being being a rather busy chap, sub-contracts the job of Human evolution to Gal-Corps from the planet Maltron. As it was the sixth day and the local pub was soon closing they decided to spend the rest of the evening drinking Tharsberg Special Brew. Next day, worse for wear, their work suffered and to make matters worse the Scroll of Evolution has been broken into 16 pieces and scattered to the four winds. Fast forward to today and Glob while having a drink is transported in front of the Supreme Being who has tasked him to find the pieces and put them back together in the right order.

Future Shock is a side view flick-screen game, where you must move around searching rooms for the pieces of the scroll represented by the letter P before a candle burns to nothing. Glob can only move left or right so has to use the rooms to fall into other rooms to collect the pieces of the scroll. Some rooms has gravity reversed and Glob will float towards the ceiling but after collecting four pieces of the scroll this reverses. There are also lifts that move Glob to higher places in the room and although there are creatures in various rooms, touching them has no effect. Pressing P brings up Puzzle mode where you see the pieces collected and must slide them around in the right order.
