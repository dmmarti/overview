	You are Mike Gunner, the most effective detective in the country, who has been hired to end with all the criminals of Robbland city, perhaps the most dangerous city on Earth. You must have very warm nerves, very cold head and especially the most prepared to pull the trigger.    Mike Gunner is a shooting-gallery Operation Wolf-style game, requiring the Gun Stick accessory. The player will have to adjust the contrast and brightness of your screen, in order to gain optimum performance.    Thorough the game you will find people who shouldn't shot at- for example kids or policemen, all of them easily identifiable. But be careful, others will appear disguised as peaceful musicians, and in the least expected moment they will show they are not so friendly.
