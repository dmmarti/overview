	If you are to be honored with the leadership of the Ostan race, you must explore a virtual reality world, collect the 24 objects which have been hidden within, and bring them all back to the base.    Cylu is viewed isometrically, and primarily consists of solving puzzles along the lines of many Ultimate Play the Game titles. Only five objects can be carried at a time, which means the route involves a lot of back-tracking. This is slightly lessened once you find some of the teleport bays, and the key to operate them.    There are 32 numbered forcefields around the game, and these must be deactivated by finding the appropriate silicon chip. Your droid requires regular re-fueling, either from canisters located in the early sections of the game, or from the RFL unit you can pick up later.
