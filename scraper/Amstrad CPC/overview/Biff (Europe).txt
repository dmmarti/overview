Biff isn't a nice chimp as he keeps being rude to his Mother, but his Mother has had enough and kicked him out of the family home. Realising he has nowhere to sleep and is starting to feel cold, Biff has decided to be nice to his Mother by doing various tasks around the jungle and hopefully be allowed to come back home. In this flick-screen arcade adventure platform game, you must find and use various objects and place them in their correct locations to complete tasks which are told to you on the screen. The tasks need to also be done in the correct order so objects that are required next flash to let you know. As you explore the jungle there are various creatures and when touched will decrease your energy and when this is empty it is game over. Also on the screen is a percentage of the game completed.
