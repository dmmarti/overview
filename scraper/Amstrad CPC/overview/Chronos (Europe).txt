Chronos is an RPG that chronicles a hero?s lifelong quest to save the homeland from a great evil. The character explores a mysterious labyrinth and each time the hero dies a year of the life is taken away. The character starts young, swift and experienced, but steadily grows older, slower and more attuned to elements such as a magic. In this VR title the player controls the main character from a cinematic view in each room (top corners of rooms usually). The camera will then teleport to a new spot once the character passes doors or out of sight. The gameplay resembles the mechanics of the Dark Souls titles. The hero uses normal and heavy attacks, blocks and dodges, and each weapon plays a bit differently.
