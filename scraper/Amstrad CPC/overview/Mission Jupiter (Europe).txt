Jupiter Mission contains elements of graphics/text adventure, space war role-playing and arcade joystick games. The different elements in Jupiter Mission are tied together by a story line. Government agents drag you from your home early on a cold January morning and put you in charge of a solo mission to Jupiter. The game's story is then furthered by graphic adventure elements and the player does different arcade sequences, such as shooting asteroids to keep from being damaged, landing on a moon, and exploring.
