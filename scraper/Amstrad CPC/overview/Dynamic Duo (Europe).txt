In Dynamic Duo the player takes the role of a bird and a dwarf who explore a haunted castle. The goal is to open the door the the calculation room, but to do so ten hidden keys have to be found first. The screen is divided into three parts: the action screen, a map and the status screen. The player can switch between the two protagonists at will and if they explore different parts of the castle (or if a second player takes part) the map gets replaced with a second action screen. This is necessary because the two have different abilities: the bird can fly and is generally faster while only the dwarf can open chests. On their way they meet various enemies that can be shot with a gun with a limited amount of ammo.
