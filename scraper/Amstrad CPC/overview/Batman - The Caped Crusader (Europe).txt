Batman: The Caped Crusader is a combination of an arcade and adventure game. The game is played with a side scrolling view, with each new location opening in a new panel similar to the appearance of a comic book. The game has two parts to it, and these can be played in any order. In A Bird In the Hand, The Penguin is back, and planning on taking over the world with an army of robotic penguins. In A Fete Worse Than Death, The Joker has kidnapped Robin, and it's up to Batman to save him.
