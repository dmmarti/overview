 Airwolf II is a direct sequel to Airwolf, however this side-scrolling shooter's story has even less in common with the popular TV series, as now Stringfellow Hawke has to pilot his ultra-modern helicopter to combat alien invasion, finding new weapons (lasers, missiles) on the way.  First released in 1987 as a part of compilations, for Amstrad CPC, Commodore 16 and Commodore Plus/4, Commodore 64 and ZX Spectrum.
