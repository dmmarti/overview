Doc Terror wants to steal the entire world's supply of tyron dichromate from the Weapons Development Centre, and only the Centurions ? Ace, Jake and Max ? can stop him. The game takes place in an enormous maze, and the aim is to locate six segments of a key. These segments are locked away in buildings, and in order to obtain them, you must open the doors to the buildings by looking for the key with the corresponding shape. To make things more difficult, these keys are surrounded by 'moats' which can only be passed if you are controlling the correct Centurion ? either Air, Land or Sea.
