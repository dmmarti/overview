Wanderer is set in the future where cats have become very valuable. The hero's cat has been kidnapped by someone who demands 8000 cats as ransom. Additionally, all the planets of the universe are obsessed with an poker-like card game. So the player visits planets, barters cards and plays the card game - and if a planet is satisfied with their own set, they reward the player with cats. Every time the player visits another planet he has to solve a straight action sequence which utilizes vector graphics for 3D glasses. Here he simply has to fly around in first person and shoot all enemy ships. Other action sequences take place in black holes.
