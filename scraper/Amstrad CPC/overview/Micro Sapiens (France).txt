Test your knowledge of French vocabulary in this game for up to four players. In each round, one player moves an alien around the screen collecting letters, while being chased by a tentacled monster. Each letter is worth a certain number of points, just like the Scrabble board game. Once eight letters are collected, or the monster eats the alien, the letters are presented and all the players have a limited amount of time to combine them to form a word. When the time runs out, each player enters their word, and the player with the highest scoring word earns points.
