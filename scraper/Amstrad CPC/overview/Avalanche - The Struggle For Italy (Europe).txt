This wargame takes it's name from Allied actions during the second World War. Operation Avalanche was the landing of Allied forces on the west coast of mainland Italy in 1943.  Accordingly, this is the scenario the game uses. The computer can be set to control either the Allied, German, or no side, and various additional settings with respect to historical circumstances (for example the loyalty of Italian forces to each side) can be made.

The main game takes place on a single, scrolling map. Units are represented by icons with no single scale (for instance, a tank icon can represent a division as well as a brigade). The gameplay structure itself consists of various phases, such as air (reconnaissance  and attacks), order (for e.g. movement actions) and combat. The latter is used to calculate the results of engagements.
