	You play Drak, the last of the Obliterators (genetically enhanced machines bio engineered for otherwise impossible missions.) Your mission is to save the Federation from an alien spacecraft.     Obliterator is an arcade style platform action game. The game screens are static (instead of scrolling, though you can optionally turn on scrolling transitions between screens.) and can be maze like at times with many locations to search. Armed with a variety of weapons, you have to board the alien spacecraft, disable its weapons, plasma drives and shields, then escape.
