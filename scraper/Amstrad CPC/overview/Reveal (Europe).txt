Now here is a highly bizarre and original game, map out a 3D landscape which you can't see! Before attempting each landscape, you're given a view of it and have about five seconds to memorise it. Then you must control a gyroscope and manoeuvre it over all of the hidden squares, while avoiding the enemies and sticking to the very strict time limit.
