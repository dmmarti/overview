	Magus and Questor are trapped in the 15 mazes of Xor. These include Dolly's Revenge, Patience Pending and The Decoder, and can be played in any order. Before going through the exit, they must collect every balloon from within the levels. All of this must be done in a limit of 2000 moves.    The characters have differing abilities, and can be swapped between at any time. Hazards to avoid include bombs, falling boulders and barriers. Four pieces of the map can be found and collected.    Prospector in the Mazes of Xor is an Amiga update adding extra levels and a level editor.
