Subterranean Stryker is a Defender inspired side scrolling shoot 'em up that takes place in a system of alien caves. The objective is to rescue 8 captive humans miners on each level to be able to exit it, while destroying the alien enemies with your laser. A shield meter shows a protective shield that will protect you from minor collisions, if depleted will cost you a life. Also a fuel meter will continuously count down acting as a timer until the level is finished. A fuel dump on the lower levels can replenish both by siphoning the energy from a spout. There are eight levels of caves and on the last level the enemy power crystal has to be destroyed in order to defeat the aliens.
