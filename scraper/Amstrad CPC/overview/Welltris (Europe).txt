	Welltris, which is the first Tetris sequel, is originally designed by Alexey Pajitnov (the   creator of Tetris) with Andrei Sgenov.     It has the same gameplay concept as Tetris; simply all the player has to do is to rotate and   maneuver the falling pieces into a proper position in order to form complete layers   in the rectangular playground. But Welltris changes this rectangular arena into a four  sided well with grid-like walls and bottom where the falling pieces can be moved from   wall to wall within the well. Form the pieces into solid rows either horizontally or vertically  on the bottom of the well.     Billed itself as Tetris in three dimensions.
