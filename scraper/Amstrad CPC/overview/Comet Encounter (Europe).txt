The return of Halley's Comet was big news in 1986, and this game sees you attempting to become the first spacecraft to land on the comet itself ? but you've got to fly through a long obstacle course before you reach the comet. Starting at the top of the screen, you must guide the spacecraft through the scenery and dodge the moving aliens.
