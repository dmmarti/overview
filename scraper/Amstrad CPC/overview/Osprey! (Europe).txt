Osprey! is an educational game based at Loch Garten in Scotland and developed in conjunction with the RSPB (The Royal Society for the Protection of Birds). The object of the game is to allocate wardens to help the ospreys successfully nest, rear young and survive the hazards that threaten them. The player is appointed as leader of the RSPB project, 'Save the Ospreys!'. The game can be started from any year between 1965 and 1979 and ends in 1981 or when all ospreys have been lost, the earlier the start year the harder the game. The number of wardens available each season varies, so some seasons there may be a shortage while at other times tasks may be easier. Weather also has an effect on the results. The wardens can be allocated to three areas; Looking after the main site, which involves preventing the public from disturbing the birds. Preventing egg stealing. Making people aware of ospreys, which has a wider effect on survival. The game is based on the efforts taken by the RSPB at the site in Scotland after it was discovered that ospreys had returned to Scotland to breed, after many years of only being seen as a rare visitor. The manual provides a detailed look at ospreys and their history in Scotland. Also included is a table showing the number of pairs breeding from 1954 to 1981 and how many were successful, this can be compared with the game results.
