Street Machine is a racing game where you have to race against seven computer controlled cars on a long street circuit for three laps. Each lap has different conditions with Lap One in the day, Lap Two at night and Lap Three in the snow. Before your race you can choose a coloured car before you go to the starting grid and ready for your race. The game is viewed from above and the screen shows a small part of the circuit with the screen scrolling in all directions as you drive. You push forward on the joystick to accelerate and press the fire button to brake. Points are awarded to the car leading after each lap and the winner is the car with the most points. As you drive and try to overtake the other drivers care must be taken not to hit the other cars or the side of the road as this damages your car. Take to much damage during a lap and a maintenance chart appears with over 70 parts of your vehicle and what percentage of damage it has occurred. You have to change any damage to below 79 as a timer counts down. Fail to change all damage then it's race over. Hit a car or the side of the road too fast and the car can be too damaged to fix and it's race over there and then. If you manage to complete a lap then you have to fix your car to move on to the next lap.
