Des Chiffres et des Lettres ("Numbers and Letters") is a French game show which inspired the similar British programme Countdown. Two players compete in a sequence of rounds challenging language and arithmetic skills. In this version you can turn off either type of rounds, and can have infinite time to think in each round, if you wish.

In letters rounds, an array of 9 letters is chosen by each player alternately choosing either a vowel or a consonant, and players must find the longest possible legitimate word. In numbers rounds, an array of face-down numbers (including 25, 50, 75 and 100 as well as 2 each of 1-10) is presented to the player, who chooses the number of 'large' numbers. A target between 101 and 999 is then generated, and players must get as close to this as possible. Additionally, there are mental arithmetic challenge rounds, in which players must solve an equation as quickly as possible.
