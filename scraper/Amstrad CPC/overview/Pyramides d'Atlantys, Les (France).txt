Somewhere underneath the Atlantic Ocean lies the mysterious, lost city of Atlantis, and an expedition has been sent out to find it. Moving your boat around the Atlantic, you must journey down to the depths of the ocean in a submarine and scour the ocean bed in the search for the city. Now, the ocean is a vast place, and you are given no clues whatsoever as to where the city might be.
