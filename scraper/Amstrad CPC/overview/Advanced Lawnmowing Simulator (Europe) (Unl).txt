Advanced Lawnmower Simulator is a 1988 simulation game originally created for the ZX Spectrum. The player is tasked with mowing lawns in exchange for rewards. The CPC version called "Advanced Lawnmowing Simulator" has been ported by Markus Hohmann.

The game was developed as an April Fools' joke by Your Sinclair, who published a joke review lauding it, and released the game on a cover tape. Several letters about the game appeared in the magazine following release, and it was revealed as an April Fools' prank in August 1990. The game has been noted as extremely unusual by IGN and Geek.com. It has also received a cult following, has received remakes, and has inspired other games with similar titles.
