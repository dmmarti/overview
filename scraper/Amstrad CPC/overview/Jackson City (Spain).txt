Jackson City is a vertically scrolling space shoot'em-up game. The player, as spaceship pilot, must fight along the game levels versus hordes of aliens and (quite surrealistic) fruits. 

Also, there are, along the levels, power-ups that improve the firepower, the speed of the player's spaceship or the amount of fuel. At the end of each level there is a final boss that must be defeated.
