Box is an unofficial adaptation of the Parker Brothers board game Black Box. The player is presented with a grid in which several atoms are hidden. The player can shoot rays into the grid from any of the edges. Depending on whether it hits or passes by atoms it will be a hit, deflection, reflection, miss or detour. The goal for the player is to determine the location of all the atoms within the grid. For each ray cast the player loses a number of points based on the type of result it gives. The game allows the player to choose the number of atoms in the grid.
