Zolyx is a Qix variant: the player is presented with a white playing field and controls a pixel. Whenever this pixel moves over the playfield, it leaves a line behind - and when the line becomes a closed form, it gets coloured. The goal is to colour 75 he can change the direction of the white pixels by pressing a button (limited) and jail them when drawing a closed line around them. This is possible because the pixels are either confined to the coloured or uncoloured parts. After finishing a level a new one starts with three changes: one more white pixel, an extra life for the player and one additional usage of the direction change button.
