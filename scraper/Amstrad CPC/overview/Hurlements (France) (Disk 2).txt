Hurlements (translated as Howls) is a horror adventure game in which you play as either Kane a small-time thief and his girlfriend Lorry, on a quest to find a stash of gold, mentioned to him by an old cell mate that had died. The problem is, your car breaks down, and now you must find the gold, repair your vehicle and get out of there before you are mauled by werewolves. 

While being an adventure game first and foremost, the addition of fights and item management adds some minor RPG elements. It is controlled entirely with the keyboard using a selection of icons to perform whatever action you so choose. There are some oddly specific actions including ones for sleeping, waking and eating. This means you need to pay attention to your tiredness and hunger but, along with health, it's represented by a single life bar.
