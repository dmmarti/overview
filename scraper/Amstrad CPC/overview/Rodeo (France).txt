Playable by 1 or 2 players, this game put the player in the old western rodeo style. The game is made of various contests such as horse and bull rodeo, static and mobile targets firing, cow catching among some others. Events have either time or ammo limitation or even both. Each gamer(s) alternatively must play all contests, one by one, and must succeed and score the best points; at the end of the game, the best gamer will be rewarded by the trophy.
