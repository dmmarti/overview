Drive your car around six obstacle courses while avoiding other cars, as well as the bombs that are dropped by planes and helicopters. You'll have to memorise each course thoroughly ? if you don't, you'll probably reach a dead end and have to reverse your car, which costs so much time that you'll have to start again anyway.
