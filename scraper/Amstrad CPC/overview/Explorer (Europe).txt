	After attempting to simulate orienteering with The Forest, Graham Relph takes things a step further by creating a game-world with no fewer than 4 billion locations.     These are drawn in considerable detail, and viewable from 2 different modes, as you fly (viewed from above) or walk (viewed panoramically). The task is to locate 9 objects, and you do this by flying close enough to one that a beacon is activated, to which will direct you to it. You must then find a patch of clean land to land on, and then get close by walking to it. Occasionally you will encounter robotic bugs to kill.
