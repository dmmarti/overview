You play as an American soldier, spreading havoc among soviet soldiers somewhere deep in the jungle and underground caverns.

The game plays as a side scrolling action game. You walk around in a maze of jungle and underground caverns while navigation is aided by a satellite link. Other tools you have at your disposal include some mines, wire cutters and a tracking beacon.

You can also get a trained dog that gives you an even better edge against your enemies.
