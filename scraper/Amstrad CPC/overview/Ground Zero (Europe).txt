	In Ground Force Zero you control a plane low on fuel as it approaches a built-up city (which is generated randomly for each game). To avoid disaster for yourself you must destroy the buildings below you, which are of different heights. You do this by pressing the 'b' key as you pass over a building, which releases a bomb which destroys the top few levels of a building.  If your plane is on the same level as a standing piece of building, it will crash, meaning Game Over. There are 10 skill levels, with the higher numbers generating taller buildings and thus reducing your margin for missing the taller ones first.
