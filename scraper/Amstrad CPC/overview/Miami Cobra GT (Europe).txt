Race your Mustang Cobra around eight tracks. Each track is divided into four stages, although you don't have to reach every stage within a certain time; your time limit is for all four stages. To help you along, you've also got a supply of turbos, although it's best to use them cautiously or you'll crash off the circuit and lose time.
