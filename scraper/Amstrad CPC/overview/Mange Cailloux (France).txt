Mange Cailloux is a variant of the arcade game Pengo. Like the original game it is played on a single screen that is full of stone blocks. The player is in control of a red bird that has to push the blocks around to create passages and to crush the blue creatures that wander around the screen. If caught by one of the blue creatures, one of three lives is lost. After losing a life it is possible for a brief time to kill the creatures by simply moving over. It is also possible to kill them by destroying the blocks that they are spawning from. Additionally there are three diamond blocks. Pushing these so that they are all connected to each other leads to bonus points. To advance to the next level the player has to stay alive for a certain amount of time or kill all the blue creatures.
