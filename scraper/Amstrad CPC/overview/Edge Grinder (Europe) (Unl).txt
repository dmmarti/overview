Edge Grinder is a side view scrolling horizontal shooter where the screen scrolls constantly as you move your spacecraft around the screen blasting waves of alien ships. As you move from left to right over one level, you must shoot or avoid the alien ships or you lose one of three lives. Your weak point on your craft is the centre so you are able to grind your craft along the walls and obstacles that appear for extra points.
