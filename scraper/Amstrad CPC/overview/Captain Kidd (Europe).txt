Help Captain Kidd collect his treasure on each screen, but make sure you collect bombs as well before they explode. When you collect treasure, you can't move back on to the square it was contained within, so some thinking is required, otherwise you may well encounter a bomb which you can't reach. You must also avoid the boots and the skulls. This is an old game with poor graphics and a short tune which plays continuously and becomes very annoying. All the levels are essentially the same and there's no variety whatsoever.
