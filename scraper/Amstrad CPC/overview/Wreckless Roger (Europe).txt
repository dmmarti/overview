Wreckless Roger is a side-view flick screen shooter where you play the role of Roger who after landing on an inhospitable planet, has discovered his spacecraft, the Millenium Sparrow, has been dismembered. The pieces of the craft have been scattered all over a cavern and so you must fly Roger around the cavern using his jet-pack, and armed with his laser to blast all the aliens in his search for the pieces. The cavern is made up of a teleport maze and to move from screen to screen, you must destroy all the aliens so that arrows appear in the side of the screen, showing where you can move next. On some screens, an exit appears in the centre of the screen but it can only be used when you hold a piece of the craft. If you are hit by any alien then Roger loses part of his power and when it reaches zero then you lose one of three lives.
