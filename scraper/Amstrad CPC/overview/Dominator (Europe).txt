	Dominator is a classic shooter game. You're in control of a small spaceship and have once again to save the earth from alien attack. You have to maneuver your craft through small passages while under permanent attack.    The first level is a vertical shooter level with your ship only in its basic configuration.  The later levels are horizontal scrolling and there you get your chance to improve your efficiency by collecting various power up ranging from speed-ups to tail cannons.    Typically, each stage has a final boss who needs a lot of firepower to be beaten.
