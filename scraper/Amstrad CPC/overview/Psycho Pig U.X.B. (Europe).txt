The object of this game is to get rid of your opponents (pigs) by throwing bombs at them. When they are thrown, the bombs will count down from the number shown on the bomb, and explode when they reach zero. But they will explode immediately once they hit their target, regardless of the countdown. Items can be picked up along the way that will help you defeat opponents. One of them is a knapsack that allows you to carry more than one bomb at a time. After certain levels, a bonus game appears, and the object of this game is to attempt to kiss the lady pigs as they pop in and out of their holes.
