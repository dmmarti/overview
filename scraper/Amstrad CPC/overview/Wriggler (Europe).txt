	One of the few games to set you as a maggot, in Wriggler you must negotiate the four stages of the Maggot Marathon. This involves trekking through a garden, a shrubbery, an underground lair, and finally a mansion.     Viewed form above the game is maze-based, with lots of Atic Atac style sections where you can see other parts of the level on the same screen, but can't access them because the design of the maze puts something in the way. Graphics are quite large and chunky - this is perhaps the closest anyone came to borrowing Rapscallion's unusual visual design.    You have an energy bar which decreases constantly, and contact with the ants, spiders and the rest of the sickly creatures reduces this further. Fortunately you can obtain apples, cherries, cups of tea (I suspect a generation of sadistic 10-year-olds started trying to ply worms with caffeine as a result of this) and other foodstuffs to recharge this. These can be eaten immediately or stored for later use, however you can only hold one object at a time. Many other items are needed to get past situations during the game, so be careful what you keep to avoid too much backtracking through the 256 screens.
