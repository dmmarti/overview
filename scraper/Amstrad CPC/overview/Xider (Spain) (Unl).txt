From the images, we might think that we are facing a simple matamarcianos, but technically we cannot call it that because we cannot shoot anyone here.nnnnWe have to control the speed and direction and speed of the ship (up: accelerate, down: slow down) and dodge everything that happens to us, from smiling ships to structures of different types or meteor fields. The faster we go, the better our score will be.nnnnIt may sound easy, but between the speed the ship can take, the inertia it has, and the fact that the collision detector is extremely finicky, surviving for more than a minute without buffering us with something will be a challenge.
