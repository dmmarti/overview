A railway is being built that will run east to west across America, and Lucky Luke has the task of guarding a train that is carrying a cargo of explosive nitroglycerine. Based on one of the many comic books featuring the cowboy Lucky Luke, this game consists of five episodes with varying styles of gameplay, such as moving around a screen trying to perform actions in the correct order, shooting bandits as they slowly appear from doorways, searching for the stolen nitroglycerine, and solving a complex puzzle by pulling levers to move railway tracks.
