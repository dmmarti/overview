Based on the book by Dennis Wheatley, Murder off Miami is a three part graphic text adventure where you play the role of Detective Officer Kettering who has to investigate the death of a British financier, who it seems committed suicide on a cruise ship off the coast off Miami. Clues must be found and people talked to as you try to uncover the answers to this mysterious death. Text describes each location with the occasional graphic showing what you see in a location and the keyboard is used to type in commands to control your hero and interact with each location.
