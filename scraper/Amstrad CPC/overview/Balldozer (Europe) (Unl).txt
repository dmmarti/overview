The Alien Bongo Beast leader, in his quest to wipe out everything honest, decent and generally nice, has constructed a demolition machine, called the Balldozer, to destroy all the Ã¦stethic brickwork on planet Barrat'omes. What this boils down to is a monochrome Breakout variant with a lot of Arkanoid amenities in the form of upgrades such as sticky bat, hard ball and speed modifiers. The blocks also come in different levels of hardness, requiring one or several hits to break. Since the ball picks up pace quickly, picking up the often-released slow-down items is a necessity.
