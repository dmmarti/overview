You are far ahead in time, the year 2464 AD and your Space Time Machine has landed on an alien planet, and being of an inquisitive nature, you decide to explore it.

You have been gifted with a special kind of power that aids you when you are exploring strange planets. You are able to mutate into the alien beings' form. On this mysterious planet of Ivorus, the beings are minute and flea-like with amazing jumping powers.

However, during your exploration, you take an unexpected trip and fall down and down and down through a deep and dark pot hole into a strange cave. All around you are flesh-eating plants, not to mention a hungry pterodactyl...

You must elude these dangers, so utilise your jumping powers to ward off your enemies til you finally escape from the disatrous cave.

No sooner are you safe, then disaster strikes again!. Down you go again, but this time the flesh eating plants have multiplied and they don't want you to escape.

Good luck!
