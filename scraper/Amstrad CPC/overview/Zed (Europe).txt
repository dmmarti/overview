You're settling down to play your favourite game when a poor quality pirate program appears which you can't get rid of. This is the threat posed by Madstar Satellite Industries, owned by Dr. Kryptic.

You take the part of The Controller' of ISIS, the Institute for the Suppression of Inferior Software. You must save the world by destroying the transmitter responsible for this threat Confused? So was the Balrog! What the transmitter has to do with my CPC and bow the pirate program got on the machine, I have no idea!

To help you on your quest you have a droid called ZED (Zetetic Enumerative Droid) which is controlled by a ZIP (Zetetic Instruction Parser unit) By using this ZIP you can swap control between yourself and ZED. This makes for some very clever puzzles where you swap between two totally different, characters - a little like the robots in Infocom's Suspended.
