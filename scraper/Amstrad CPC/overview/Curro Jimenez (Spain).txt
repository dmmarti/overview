In 19th century Spain, the French army is occupying large parts of the country. Now they have amassed enough firepower to destroy the entire country ? but one warrior, Curro Jim√©nez, has the courage to confront and defeat the French single-handedly! You must travel on foot, on horseback, and even on a hot air balloon, through towns and across countryside to reach the French army camp. You are armed with a gun to shoot the French invaders, and along the way, you need to collect treasure chests to obtain dynamite; some chests may give you an extra life instead.
