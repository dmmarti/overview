	"Sito Pons" is a popular motorcycle game based on the same named Spanish motorcycle driver. It was the Zigurat's second fruitful game dedicated to a national pilot (the first game was Carlos Sainz).    In this game, we will pilot as Sito Pons -obviously- on the 500cc World Championship, through 14 exciting circuits, starting the official training to classify, and later running on the race.
