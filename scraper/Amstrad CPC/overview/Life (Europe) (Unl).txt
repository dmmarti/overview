Life is a simulation of Conway's Game of Life. They player can draw his or her own patterns and watch how they evolve based on the simple rules of Conway's Game of Life. 
Any live cell with fewer than two live neighbours dies, as if caused by under-population.
Any live cell with two or three live neighbours lives on to the next generation.
Any live cell with more than three live neighbours dies, as if by overcrowding.
Any dead cell with exactly three live neighbours becomes a live cell, as if by reproduction.
The player can let the simulation play out, pause, reset, place cells and clear the screen.
