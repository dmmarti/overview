You are alone in bed with a bad storm raging outside with no lighting as the power lines are down and the branches of trees banging against your window keeps waking you up. When you do sleep the you have a weird dream of being on an endless woodland path and once again you are woken up but you aren't in bed anymore. You are actually on the woodland path but you are unsure whether it is another dream or real but you have no option but to explore trying to get back home. Forestland is a text adventure where the screen has text describing each location you visit and you type in commands with the keyboard to interact with your surroundings.
