The setting is ancient Greece. You are one of the gods of Greek mythology who has incurred the wrath of the all-powerful god Zeus. As a punishment, Zeus has cast a curse of forgetfulness upon you, and now you don't even know who you are. The only way to restore your memory is to enter the realm of Hades and drink the water from the Pool of Remembrance.
