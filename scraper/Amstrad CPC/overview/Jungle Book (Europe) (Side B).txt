Deep within India's Black Jungle, a scandalous crime has taken place. Someone has stolen the jeweled crown of King Louie, the orangutan who rules Monkey City. Now he's hoppin' mad and there will be no peace until his crown is returned. Mowgli and his friends are counting on you to help recover this sacred treasure and restore calm to the jungle world.  

Not to be confused with the Disney title of the same name, yet based on Disney's 1994 live-action adaptation of the acclaimed book, you must get the crown back by solving puzzles and watching FMV sequences. The game comes with a microphone that lets you interact with the game.
