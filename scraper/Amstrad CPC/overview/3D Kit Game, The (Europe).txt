The 3d kit game has been included as an example to illustrate some of the environments that are possible with the 3d Construction Kit. This is supplied as a data file and can be played as a stand alone game by using the Freescape Compiler or within the condition editor.nnnnThe objective of the game is to escape from the mysterious world in which you find yourself, and return to Earth. Some sort of space vehicle will probably come in handy (large clue).
