	Like in the prequels you empty areas infested by all kinds of enemies while running for the exit. Like this was rather a straight forward thing in the first two games, it's not that easy to finish a level anymore. While you only had to run until you find the exit (and besides killing hordes of enemies you probably find some keys to unlock doors leading to deeper dungeons) you might have to solve a few "quests" to proceed to the next level in this installment.  These "quests" are very basic, for example you have to find object A, then bring it to B, advance to C and finally go to D to uncover the exit.  The big difference is the graphics. While you had a top down view in the first 2 games Gauntlet 3 has an isometric kind of view.  The old 4 characters (warrior, wizard, elf and valkyrie) are ready for action again and this time they get backup by 4 new characters which include the Lizard, Neptune, Stoneman and the Iceman.
