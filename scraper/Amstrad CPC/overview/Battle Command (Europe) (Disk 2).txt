Battle Command is a 3D arcade/strategy game, loosely derived from the same developers' Carrier Command. In a near future alternate reality, the Ultra War is fought between the two dominate races in the New World. The 'Mauler' is the latest technology - an Armored Fighting Machine capable of being lifted in and out of hostile territory by a fast Stealth Chopper, and armed with the most advanced weaponry science can devise. You command a single Mauler assault tank in one of a series of scenarios. These range from a railway ambush to escort duties and a raid on a riverside hideout. Before starting you must choose the right weaponry based on the mission briefing.
