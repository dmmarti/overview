	An imaginative action game in which you must guide a ball-shaped craft through a succession of levels. These have a patchwork-quilt type display, with holes to avoid, and squares of various colors, which affect the craft's speed, both within its power potential and into warp, as well as a control-reverser and lots of holes. You can jump these holes by pressing fire, although you have a limited number of these for each level, and adjust the speed by pulling the joystick forward or backwards.  You face a time limit on each of the 21 levels, although your time is boosted every time you complete one. A simultaneous 2-player mode is included, similar to the split-screen mode in the Lotus games (by the same authors).
