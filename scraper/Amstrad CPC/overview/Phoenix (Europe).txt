Emulator for Amstrad CPC of the classic arcade game Phoenix from 1980. The original arcade machine was made by the American company Amstar (sounds a little bit like Amstrad, doesn't it) and had a 8085 CPU. So, the Amstrad CPC can directly run the original game program on its 8085-compatible Z80 CPU. To emulate the arcade machine's video and sound hardware on the Amstrad home computer I wrote specific Z80 routines. These are still a little bit buggy now. Made two versions. One with sixteen colors but lower resolution, and a second one with the original resolution but with only four colors.
