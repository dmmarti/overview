Q*Bert lives on in budget form on the Amstrad, although this clone has a couple of features that distinguish i- from other versionsnnInstead of the normal pyramidal structure of cubes the layout is instead rectangular. At first it is complete, but as you make your way through the screens more and more blocks disappear, leaving some dangerous holes for you to negotiate.nnnnYou. the eponymous Screwball, have to change the colour of each cube within 60 sec ends or lose a life You achieve thin by bouncing around and landing on each square Unfortunately there are some very nasty black bugs around who no: only sport bizarre fuzzy red hair-dos, but also do for you if you find yourself on the square as them.
