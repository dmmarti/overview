Deep within a labyrinthine mine lie deposits of gold, and being the intrepid miner that you are, your aim is to retrieve as much treasure as you can from the mine while dodging the many hazards that lurk within it ? including dragons! You have an oxygen tank for travelling through flooded areas, and a battery for your lamp; if it runs out, the game is over. You have a supply of spare batteries and oxygen tanks, but you can only carry up to four items at a time while you're in the mine.
