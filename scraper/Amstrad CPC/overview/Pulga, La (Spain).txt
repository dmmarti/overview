A Flea arrives on board of a space probe to the Cebolla-7 planet, which is an intricate labyrinth of caverns. The objective is to find the exit of each maze-like level. It isn't so easy, as the player must ascend very carefully, avoiding protruding rocks and branches, taking care to not fall (which forces the player to start again from the ground level). The only enemy here is a Pterodactilous that will do everything it can to devour the flea. It is not always present, but when it attacks, the flea must avoid it.
