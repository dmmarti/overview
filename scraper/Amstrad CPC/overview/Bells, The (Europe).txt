This is a fairly close copy of Ocean/Century's arcade platformer, Hunchback. Your goal is to traverse each screen filled with perils, so that you may reach the bell that is placed on the right side. The first screen contains only a ball or bullet that crosses the screen, which you must jump over. Jumping straight into the bell rope will kill you, however. The next screen has gaps which you must jump across, with the right distance in mind. After that comes a similar screen, only the pits are filled with pikemen who lower and raise their pikes. Timing is necessary in order not to be impaled as you jump over the pikemen. The fourth screen has the object from screen one hurtling across the screen, so your jumps across the pits must be timed so that you don't jump into its path. The fifth screen is a variation on the third, but with an arrow shooting over your head so that timing must take both the pikemen and the arrow in account. The game procedes in a similar fashion, with different combinations of projectiles, pikemen and pits.

Your bell-ringer has two different jumps. One is for jumping up in the air, so that you can avoid projectiles, and the other one is a long jump for bridging gaps. Each screen must be crossed within a short amount or time, or Quasimodo will be struck by lightning.
