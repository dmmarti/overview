You have been assigned to rid several planets of an army of mutant aliens. Although there are a variety of aliens, the ones you must eliminate are the spider-like creatures, but instead of shooting them, you must trap them by lifting a grille off the floor, letting them fall into the hole, then replacing the grille.
