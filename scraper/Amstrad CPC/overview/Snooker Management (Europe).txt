Snooker allows you to play a game of Snooker on your own or against a friend following the rules of the game. Before you start a game you can select one or two players (The C64 version allows you to watch the computer play) and if you want a 10 ball or 15 ball game. When you play an actual game the whole table is shown on screen and is viewed from above. To take a shot you position a cross to where you want to hit the ball and when your happy with your position you hold down the fire button and a power bar grows. As the bar is growing you can adjust the spin of the ball. When the bar reaches the power you require you let go of the fire button. In a one player game you keep playing until you pot every ball and in two player the winner is the player with the most points when all balls are potted.
