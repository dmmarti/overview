	Wizard Warz is an overhead view action RPG using "classic" graphics. You start of the game as an apprentice wizard with four minor spells, and aim to defeat 7 master wizards to become the chief wizard yourself. To aid you in your quest you must return six treasures to their rightful owners and find more powerful spells.     There are also numerous monsters to fight on your travels, each with their own strengths and weaknesses to your offensive magical barrage.    You can also use a familiar to help your mission - for example, having a crow will let you see the furthest distance.
