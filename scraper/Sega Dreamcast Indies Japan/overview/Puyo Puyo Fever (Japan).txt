Puyo Puyo Fever (ぷよぷよフィーバー), renamed Puyo Pop Fever for international release, is the fifth "main" installment in the Puyo Puyo series, originally developed for Sega NAOMI arcade hardware by Sonic Team. It was the first completely original Puyo Puyo title to be produced after the original developers, Compile, filed for bankruptcy.

Puyo Puyo Fever is as close as the series has come to a reboot, abandoning most of Compile's Madou Monogatari characters and settings in favour of a new, original cast engineered by Sonic Team. However saying this, the game's story still remains canon with prior games, as Arle and Carbuncle are transported to this new world after the former's magic fails.
