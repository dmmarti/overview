Chaos Field is a Sega NAOMI GD-ROM arcade and Sega Dreamcast game developed by Able and Milestone Inc. in 2004. It was the first game by Milestone, and, like their other games, is a vertical shoot-'em-up. The game was only released in Japan, but eventually made it to the west after being ported to the Nintendo GameCube in the following year.
