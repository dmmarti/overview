You are the guardian of the 21st century undersea farm. Not only is this important to the survival of the people on earth but the company you work for have risked millions on this venture.    Zardos, the evil king of a distant planet, needs this food for his-self and has sent android divers with other sea creatures to steal this food.    You are provided with the under sea hi-tech, sub-surface cruiser. Sea Devil, equipped with the latest in sonar screens. You can spot targets at a great distance. As they come into range your laser makes quick work of the poachers and accumulate valuable sub credit points for yourself.    Zardos personally is commanding a submarine which will fire cluster bombs to keep you at bay.    Can you get Zardos in his sub? Hes worth 1000 points if you can.
