It's like actually being at the alley. The game has all of the action and sounds of the real thing. Direct your ball with as much hook as you want. Make strikes, spares, but watch out for splits and gutter-balls! Keeps score according to official rules. Try your hand at a perfect game! Can be played alone or by up to 4 players.
