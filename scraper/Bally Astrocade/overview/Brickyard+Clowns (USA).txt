This cartridge consists of two games: Brickyard and Clowns. Both games can be played by one to four players.    In Clowns you get points for popping balloons at the top of the screen. To reach them, you have to move a seesaw under a jumping clown. This will launch away the clown already standing on the seesaw, hopefully towards the balloons.     Brickyard is a clone of Breakout. It is almost identical to the original game but differs in that the ball moves in a trajectory and not in a straight path. The game can be played in four different difficulties that alters the speed of the ball as well as the size of the paddle.
