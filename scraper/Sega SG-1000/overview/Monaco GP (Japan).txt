Monaco GP by Sega. The game is very simple - all the player needs to do is avoid cars and obstacles on a track. He/she can speed up and slow down and two players may play at the same time. Monaco GP was Sega's last arcade game to use discrete logic circuits rather than a digital CPU, meaning it cannot be emulated in emulators such as MAME. The player's score and time are also displayed on external LED displays, so it is impossible to re-create the game perfectly.
