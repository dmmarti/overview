Pronounced “show´ gee” (hard “g” as in “geese”) is the traditional chess of Japan. Modern shogi is approximately as old as modern western chess (what we call chess), about 500 years old. The game is probably derived primarily from Chinese chess, xiangqi, but also has interesting similarities to Thai chess, makruk.
