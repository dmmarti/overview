If it's raining on Sunday....it's “CHAMPION GOLF” day, You can enjoy hitting the ball with the appropriate club to match the shot, walking around the coarse with the considerate caddie over its extensive fairways, roughs, green, ponds and bunker areas. Getting a “Birdie”, “Eagle” or an amazing “Hole in One”, or even more miraculous “Albatross” will make you feel like you are on top of the world.
