The alien monsters have arrived, and it's up to you to destroy them with multicolored bombs. Create bombs on the lower screen, and fling them at the invaders at the top. Match up the colors correctly to destroy an invader, or knock them around to create a chain attack. This makes the game halfway between an action game and a puzzle game. You'll need reflexes to destroy the aliens fast enough, and brainpower to attack them correctly.  Monster Bomber features a scenario mode, with a branching series of challenges, (complete with save/load) as well as survival mode and multiplayer.
