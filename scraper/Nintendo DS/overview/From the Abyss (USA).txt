From the Abyss is a dungeon crawling RPG where the player takes command of a custom created character.  The story takes place in a small country called Rubenhaut where for many years the world has been free of monster when the Dimensional Abyss was created by the Saint of Light to seal them off in a parallel dimension, afterwards Rubenhaut was built to guard the gate.  However, one day the seal was broken and the monster that was once sealed off have been released again and is wreaking havoc on the world and it is up to the player to explore the dungeons of the world and collect parts of a magical crystal called the Abyss Gate in order to re-seal the rift.  The gameplay consists of exploring the world and dungeons, collecting items, defeating enemies afterwards absorbing their souls and steal their skills and combine them with their existing skills and weapons for a multitude of different attacks.  What makes From the Abyss different from other RPGs is that every time the player starts a new game, everything is randomized ensuring an unique experience each time.  There is also multiplayer mode where two friends can play co-op and advance through the game and fight the main boss, The Abyss Lord.
