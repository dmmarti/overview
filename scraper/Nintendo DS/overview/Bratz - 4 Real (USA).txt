The Bratz are in their first year of high school! They're going to be the most fabulous friends ever to grace Carry Nation High School! But the school class president has different plans and breaks up the Bratz girls into designated cliques. The girls want to find a way to bring all the cliques in the school together...and what better way than through a fabulous talent show!
