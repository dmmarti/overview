A new fun and crazy action/adventure game in which you control a team of unlikely heroes with suspicious biography to undertake the maddest quest ever.  Play a delirious trio: Glandalf, the cinema loving wizard, Luigi, the failed thief, and Extermino, the executioner who thinks with his axe rather than his head! Visit the huge dungeons scattered with countless traps, repel the onslaught of hundreds of wild creatures haunting the place and determined to stand in your way, and solve dozens of riddles and puzzles. From the Pirates caves to the heart of the Egyptian pyramids, through the corridors of the Dracula's castle, Dungeon Raiders will carry you into the world's craziest places through the most delirious quest.
