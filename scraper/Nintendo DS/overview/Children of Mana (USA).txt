Some years before the action begins, a great catastrophe began at the base of the Mana Tree. This gives the main characters, Ferrik, Tamber, Poppen and Wanderer, who's parents were killed in the disaster, reason to find out what happened. The game takes place on the Island of Illusia, at the center of which lies the Mana Tree.  The game is a real time Action/RPG very similar to the style of Secret of Mana. New features include dual weapon systems, so characters can use one long range and one melee weapon at a time.   Although there is much more that can be done with each weapon, there are only four in the game, as opposed to twice as many in previous titles.  The game supports Wireless LAN for 4 players.
