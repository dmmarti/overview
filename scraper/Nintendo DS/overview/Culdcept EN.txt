Culdcept is a turn-based strategy video game, with elements of board games and collectible card games. In Culdcept, the player takes on the role of a Cepter. Cepters are beings that have the ability to use magical cards to summon creatures, cast spells, and perform various other feats of wizardry. As players advance through the game, they earn additional cards that they can use to create customised "books" (decks of 50 cards) with which to better defeat their foes.This is a port of the original version to the Nintendo DS with added content.
