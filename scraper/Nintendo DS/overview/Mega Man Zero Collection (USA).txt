Mega Man Zero Collection is a set of all four games in the Mega Man Zero series on a single game cart.  It includes:  Mega Man Zero Mega Man Zero 2 Mega Man Zero 3 Mega Man Zero 4  In addition to the four games, Mega Man Zero Collection also features an art gallery with works from the games in the series.  The e-Reader cards that were exclusive to the Japanese version of Mega Man Zero 3 and provided in-game enhancements are now discoverable throughout that game as collectibles.  There is also the option to play through all four games in one continuous playthrough, rather than having to select each game individually.  Finally, an included "Easy Mode" makes the game more accessible to those not used to the game's tough difficulty level.
