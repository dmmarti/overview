      Looney Tunes: Duck Amuck lets players wield the Nintendo DS stylus to         irritate, aggravate and infuriate their own Daffy Duck in humorous ways.         In the game inspired by the classic Duck Amuck cartoon, players will         compete against Daffy through a series of mini-games that range from         retro inspired favorites to modern, innovative gameplay interactions,         with the goal of driving Daffy's temperature, and his temper, through         the roof. Looney Tunes: Duck Amuck will also feature wireless game play         allowing players to not only gang up on Daffy as a team but also battle         each other in head-to-head competition.
