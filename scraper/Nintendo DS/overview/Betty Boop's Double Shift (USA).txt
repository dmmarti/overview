Starring the animated cartoon character Betty Boop originally introduced in animated films starting from 1930, in this game she is a waitress helping Grampy run Betty's, a jazz club serving not only jazz music but also a selection of candy and milkshakes. With the money she earns, Betty wants a shot at stardom.  It is a classic waitress game where the player controls Betty to manage the crowd visiting the club. Gameplay is divided into two shifts. She has to direct customers to seats, take their orders and serve them. Orders include candy, a milkshake or a specific song from the band. Based on the speed Betty fulfils the requests, a tip is awarded. Serving is done through the stylus by matching the correct colours, but Betty also has to keep an eye on the crowd kept outside by doorman Gorilla and the rest the band needs between songs.  When the first shift is completed, Betty enters the stage to perform. A bar of notes is shown on the top screen and players need to select the corresponding notes in the correct order on the bottom screen to wow the audience.  By doing well through both shifts, a gold star is awarded. It can be used in the following shifts to trigger the power mode where Betty uses her charm to entertain all guests at once. Customers such as Snobby Sally, Goons, Lazy Bones, Slobs, Critics and Military boys all have different characteristics and needs that are to be taken into account.  In the multiplayer mode players go head to head in a first shift memory matching game or take the stage in the note tapping second shift.
