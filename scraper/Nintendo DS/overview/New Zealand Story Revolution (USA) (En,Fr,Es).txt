The game is a remake of the classic platformer The New Zealand Story. As in the original, the player takes control of Tiki the Kiwi, who sets out to rescue his friends from the clutches of an evil leopard seal. The goal of each level is thus to reach the cage of an imprisoned Kiwi bird and free it. To make it through the levels, Tiki is equipped with a bow the get rid of the constantly respawning enemy. The remake features some new mechanics, like a double jump and a different health system (Tiki dies at one hit in the old game) and several mini games played on the touch screen such as find the differences. In the normal game mode the bottom screen functions as a map of the current level. There are two difficulty levels.  The game features four player multi-player in wireless mode.
