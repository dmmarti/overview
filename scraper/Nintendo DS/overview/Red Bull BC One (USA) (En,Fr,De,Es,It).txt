Red Bull BC One is a Nintendo DS game based on a break dancing competition with the same name. It's a mix of a rhythm action game and a puzzle game where players get to compete against different break dancers from around the world.  Before starting the game players gets to design their own dancer. This is done in the dressing room where the players can customize their characters in different categories. It's possible to choose different body styles, hairstyles and clothing. Playing the career mode will let players unlock more clothing that their character can use.   The actual gameplay consists of performing different dance moves. These moves are shown on the top screen and are done by playing a simple connect the dots puzzle game on the lower screen. Dots of different colour are shown across the screen and the player has to create shapes by connecting at least three dots of the same colour using the stylus. For each turn the player need to create as many shapes as possible before the time runs out. There is also special star shaped dots. If these are included in a shape the player will perform special moves and gain more points. It's also possible to create perfects, which is the largest possible shape of the turn. By creating multiple perfects the player will gain multipliers that will multiply the overall score.   There's a couple of game modes. The main one is the career mode where players get to battle against different b-boys with the goal to reach the final of the Red Bull BC One competition. There's also the free mode where players can improve their scores of a specific battle. The game also has a multiplayer mode where players can compete against friends in a one-on-one battle via multi card play.
