A great war once raged across the land with many a valiant knight falling on the field of battle. In the end, the evil forces have prevailed, and have since taken over and corrupted the once great kingdom. On a stormy night a Wisp is awakened by a strange armored maiden. The wisp holds the memories of the war, and is now seeking all the valiant dead to be brought back to the world of the living in order to complete their mission and take back the land that was once theirs.  Knights in the Nightmare can be loosely summed up as a Strategy RPG, but it is played like no other Strategy RPG in existence. The game is almost entirely stylus controlled on Nintendo DS, and combines the active-timer turn-based combat of a game such as Final Fantasy VI with elements of bullet-hell top-down shooters, and relies on a set of unorthodox rules for completion of its goals.  Once in the field of battle the player controls the Wisp who can cause the spirits of fallen heroes inhabiting the area to temporarily reconstitute into their physical form and do battle with monsters that now roam the land. The player can recruit those warriors permanently into their party by seeking out objects that meant something to them while they were alive.  The game features a robust character customization system that includes many classes of units, multiple jobs per each unit class, and a soul transplant system that allows the player to transfer all attributes of one player into another.
