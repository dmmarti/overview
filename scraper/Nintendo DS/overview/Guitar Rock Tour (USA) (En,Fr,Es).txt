The first musical game for mobile phones devoted purely to the guitar and rock music has just received a massive facelift and been ported to the Nintendo DS.  In this outing the player has the choice to play either guitar or the drums as you tour the world. Unlike the Guitar Hero franchise, Guitar Rock Tour doesn't use any add-ons and instead players will use the stylus to hit the notes as they fall down. Moreover with the drums players are given the choice of using the stylus or shoulder buttons to hit the notes.  The game does boast some good quality cover songs such as Girlfriend, Underclass Hero, In the Shadow, Beat It, Rock You Like a Hurricane, and Message in a Bottle.
