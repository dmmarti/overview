Konductra is a touch-based game where players can challenge one another via the Nintendo Wi-Fi Connection and battle head-to-head by matching colorful tiles and attempting to block the opponent’s progress. Players can square off against the computer, complete challenging tasks, or rack up high scores to practice for matches against the greatest puzzle masters online.  Konductra challenges players to create and destroy lines with colored tiles to either earn points or attack an opponent. Four game modes are offered, including Task, Score, VS. CPU, and VS. Human. In both versus modes, the objective is to beat the opponent by filling up the rival’s board as quickly as possible by destroying lines on the player’s own board and sending them to the opponent’s board. Gamers destroy lines by matching tiles and using the stylus to trace from like colored conductors running along the four edges of the screen.
