A pseudo 3D (game is played on a 2D plane, but the stages will rotate around Spider-Man at certain points) beat-em-up/adventure game. Vicarious Visions' first title on the Nintendo DS, the game puts the player into the role of Peter Parker (AKA Spider-Man) playing through various missions with varying objectives and pitting him against the likes of Mysterio, The Vulture, and the main villain, Doctor Octavius. The missions themselves vary from missions requiring you to find all hostages to bomb defusal missions and fast paced boss battles.
