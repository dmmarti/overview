Hana Deka Club: Animal Paradise is a 2007 video game by Agatsuma Entertainment for the Nintendo DS. It was originally slated for release in the US as 'Pocket Pets', by O3 Entertainment. Empire Interactive later published the title as 'Animal Paradise', as it had already done so in Europe. The game features famous photographs from Japanese photographer, Yoneo Morita.    The newest addition to the Animal Paradise family will take players to Animal Island Park, home to wild animals from all over the world, where they will explore distinct areas of the island including the Savannah and Jungle, each boasting their own unique species.
