Renegade Kid returns to the DS with this second game, Moon. After updating the Renegade Engine, used for the first game, Dementium, this new shooter for the DS puts you in the role of Major Edward Kane, Chief of Military Operations for the Extra-Terrestrial Encounter Organization. The year is 2058 and you and your squad are sent to the moon to investigate strange things that have been happening at the new moon bases. An alien hatch has been discovered at the construction site of one of the bases. So you need to take charge and take care of business.  As its predecessor, it tries to fill the lack of shooters for Nintendo's handheld. With the stylus for aiming, the D-pad for moving and the shoulder buttons for shooting, Moon revisits the late 90's style of shooter started by the Quake series.  The game features 24 episodes, 7 different weapons, various levels of difficulty, bonuses and other game modes to unlock.
