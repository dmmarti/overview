Deep Labyrinth is a slow-paced first person dungeon exploration game for Nintendo DS. The movement is controlled with D-pad, while all of the game’s attacks are executed through touch-screen. Deep Labyrinth’s magic system requires the player to draw symbols – Kirie on a 3x3 grid, in order to cast spells. As the game progresses, the Kirie become more and more complex, eventually requiring strings of up to 9 unique symbols.  The game is split into two chapters different enough to be separate games.  In the first chapter tells the story of a boy named Shawn, whose family is stranded on the roadside by a blown tire. His parents go off to find help, but mysteriously vanish. As it’s getting late, and a storm is approaching Shawn and the family pet – dog named Ace, seek shelter in an apparently abandoned mansion close by, but as they do, both are transported into a bizarre fantasy world. Apparently, this world is a place where unneeded human memories are sent do be erased, and as we find out – Shawn’s parents’ memories of him and each other are scheduled for deletion. This sets our hero on a quest to save his family and, perhaps discover the dark secrets of the world of memories.  The second chapter casts you as a hero mysteriously transported into an unnamed dungeon, where he soon discovers a girl trapped in a crystal. The hero has a vague recollection of once knowing the girl, but it is suggested that she died long ago. From that point on the game becomes about escaping the dungeon and saving the girl.  The two chapters are different enough to be separate games. Chapter one is fleshed out with NPCs, dialogue, and story event cutscenes, as well as a several lengthy anime FMVs, while the second chapter is much darker, and features very little in terms of story, focusing on the combat instead.
