Bomberman arrives in his first adventure for the Nintendo DS. In Bomberman's single player campaign, there are 100 stages to conquer. You will gain abilities along the way that will aid you in your adventure. There is the Bomb Kick, Remote Bomb, Power Bomb, and many others. If a wall or enemy stands in your way, just blow it up. Many puzzles and bosses await you in this adventure.  Bomberman's main attraction is the multi-player mode. Up to 8 can battle with just a single game-card. There are 30 stages to play with many different options to choose from. If you are alone, you can still play the battle mode against up to 7 computer controlled bots. There are also voice controlled stages that allow you to plant or blow up your bombs at the sound of your voice.
