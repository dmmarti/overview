Chicken Shoot is a gallery shooting game based on free 2003 flash game of the same name. The player shoots all the chickens that appear on the 2D hand-drawn screens. The top screen is used to show the gameplay, while the bottom one shows statistics such as the remaining time, the score, the type of gun and the remaining ammo. The game can be controlled through the buttons, or in combination with the stylus to aim at the chickens.  The basic game modes are identical to those of the Wii version: Arcade (shoot a specific number of chickens), Classic (time limit) and Catch an Egg (a mini-game where eggs need to be caught before they drop on the ground). Different kinds of guns can be picked up and every now and then enemies thrown an egg towards the screen that needs to be blown up quickly. Extra points are awarded for shooting certain background items, bombs destroy everything on the screen, food can be picked up to refill energy (Arcade) and clocks add more time (Classic). There are six levels/environments: The Village, The Forest, Nevada Desert, Antarctica, Rocky Island and Sahara.  There are two multi-player modes: cooperative gameplay for two players or a four-player competitive game mode where players need to score as much points as possible in a set amount of time.
