Disney Friends DS lets players directly interact with their favorite Disney characters, including Stitch, Simba, Dory, and Winnie the Pooh. 

Using the touchscreen and microphone, players can talk and play with their new friends, join them in their favorite games, and take care of them by feeding them, petting them, and taking them on adventures in locations inspired by the classic films. As players befriend each of the characters, their relationship will grow and new antics and collectibles will become available, including pins and other unique accessories.

Disney Friends DS also features both local and wi-fi multiplayer minigames and trading.
