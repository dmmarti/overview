This handheld version is similar to its computer cousins.  Players build their own dream zoo with a variety of animals like lions, tiger, giraffes, polar bears and a variety of many more.  Players can also place gift shops, soda stands and food stands to satisfy their customers and make money.  Players can also unlock hidden animals and environments by completing certain achievements throughout the game.

While the game is much like the others with the obvious differences such as graphics and the ability to utilize the Dual Screen technology of the Nintendo DS, it also has 50 animal cards that gives players information of animals around the world.
