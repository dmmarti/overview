In this game based on the 2008 DreamWorks movie of the same name, the player is Po the panda. Po finds out that the best kung fu masters have been captured by the evil Tai Lung. Po is fat, loves to eat dumplings, and is pretty slow and clumsy at kung fu, so he is shocked when he is asked to go rescue them. Although some elements have been changed, the game's theme is largely identical to the movie and linear in design.  Po's journey consists of finding the five kung fu masters, mastering a new skill that they teach him, then continuing on to find Tai Lung. This game is a 3rd-person side-scroller with frequent use of the touch screen and seems largely based on the mechanics and engine employed in the DS version of Spider-Man 3.  Po's movements are controlled through the D-pad while attacks are performed by swiping the styles on the touch screen. These are also used to throw objects and perform the learned special moves. Most of the gameplay consists of hand to hand combat with enemies, and traversing levels by consulting your top screen mini-map. New moves are learned gradually and there are also small puzzle elements where Po needs to interact with the environment to progress.
