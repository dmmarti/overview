Puzzle Chronicles is a casual game that combines item-matching puzzling with RPG elements, including character progression and a fantasy story line in the vein of Infinity's earlier titles Puzzle Quest: Challenge of the Warlords and Puzzle Kingdoms.  The puzzle part is played on a board with vertical divider line in the middle. The goal is to push the divider line back to decrease the opponent's territory until no more moves are possible. This is done by matching groups of three gems into like colours along the divider line. These groups fall on the board horizontally. Pushing the divider line back is done by destroying rage gems. There are also special abilities and a sidekick known as a Warbeast that attacks the enemy when a sufficient amount of gems of certain colour has been cleared.  Removing gems also enables the player to collect mana, power spells and items that are then used to attack the opponent and reduce their board space. In addition to the main puzzle game, there are five other mini-games ranging from upgrading the Warbeast companion to crafting new items, while navigating a number of different maps and completing simple quests.
