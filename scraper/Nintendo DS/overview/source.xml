This game is a standard "point and click" adventure, with the player controlling Edgeworth's movements and what he interacts with. For each case, the goal is to collect evidence to determine who the perpetrator is, how the crime was committed and their motive. This is presented as a combination of a third-person view showing the characters at the crime scene and through animated close-up images of the characters, annotated by text dialog. In some cases, still images are used to highlight dramatic scenes.</desc>

	<desc>After arriving at the Animal Village, you try desperately to fit in and make friends.  After almost succeeding, a boxing gym opens and all the animals join up.  Looks like you'll have to take part, too.  Get ready to box!

Animal Boxing is a game that requires you to hold the Nintendo DS upside down to play. The player uses the touch screen to punch in a variety of ways - tapping your opponent throws a standard punch, swiping horizontally throws a hook, and swiping upwards throws an uppercut. By holding the stylus on-screen longer, you can charge power for a more powerful punch. The Control Pad is used to dodge left and right, as well as block.

As your boxer takes and delivers hits, their Anger Meter increases. When it is at its maximum, your boxer fills with rage, and all of their attacks become more powerful for a limited time. This can be used to turn the tide in a match. However, opponents can also use this tactic, meaning that blocking and dodging become very important during these moments!

As with other boxing games, your goal is to defeat your opponents in a series of bouts to win the championship belts. Once you defeat the champion, you'll win the belt and progress to the next championship. Each championship you win unlocks new animals to fight against in the Vs. Animal matches, as well as new items to decorate your boxer with.</desc>

	<desc>Aquarium by DS is a fish tank simulation in which the player can choose from 30 different underwater animals.  Additionally, the player can customize their tank in size and add different backgrounds and accessories like plants, rocks or even buildings like the Leaning Tower of Pisa. New fish types can be unlocked by taking good care of the aquariums residents.

And that's the aim of the game, taking care of the fish in the tank. They need to be fed, the tank has to be cleaned and water temp and salinity have to be adjusted to create a perfect environment. A wrong environment or an unsuitable mix of animals in the tank will result in the death of the players pets. Instead of swimming dead at the surface or bloody death animations they simply disappear from the screen. Not playing the game for a few days and therefore not feeding, will result in a deadly surprise, too.

Using the Wi-Fi-feature of the DS the player can swap fishes with other players.</desc>
	<path>./Arctic Tale (USA).nds</path>
	<desc>Arctic Tale is based on the National Geography documentary of the same name. Players control a polar bear (both cub and adult) trying to survive in a harsh climate of snowy landscapes. There are eleven stages where the little bear explores the environment, searches for foods and collects paw prints that unlock pictures in a photo gallery and additional chapters. Later, two other animals can be controlled as well: a walrus that is also able to explore underwater environment, the fast Arctic fox able to hunt down rabbits and an orca whale.

The levels consist of free-roaming environments, on land or underwater, where the animals need to gather food to avoid having the heart icon fade away. While playing 16 different mini-games can be accessed where the player can earn bronze, silver and golds awards to unlock additional chapters. These games include Ice Slide (obstacle course), Shuffle (slide to the center of a ring), Food Fight, Ice Flow Rodeo (control a broken piece of ice through rough currents), Survive the Cold (cross an icy area using shelters to hide from the cold), Catch-a-Seal, Ice Sheet, Clam Scavenge (find eight hidden clams), Herd Flow (guide an ice block without hitting anything), Walrus Hunt, Orca Race and more.</desc>

	<path>./Arkanoid DS (USA) (En,Fr,De,Es,It).nds</path>
	<desc>The latest version of Taito's classic game: Arkanoid.
It features the classic gameplay of the previous games, the player controls the Spaceship VAUS (a moving platform at the base of the lower screen) and its energy ball to destroy the color block (in the upper screen) through each levels.
As usual, there are various power-ups to help through the game (laser, slow ball, duplicate balls, next level, etc.)

The game has one player mode, multiplayer and vs COM modes.

The one player mode consists of the Clear mode and the Quest mode.

The Clear mode is a series of 7 zones of 5 rounds each. There is a total of 28 zones in the game. At the end of the Clear modes, Ananke (the main character and pilot of the VAUS) frees one of his captured friends, these friend's VAUS can then be used in the game.

In the Quest mode, each previously played round is available to replay with a specific challenge (Break all blocks of one color within time limit, or ball launch limit, etc.) Each round gives points that can be used at the shop to buy in-game features to customize it (Blocks shapes, VAUS, backgrounds, etc.)

The VS Com and Multiplayer are similar. You must defeat either the Com or another friend in either Bust All or Bust Color match. The quickest to achieve the goal wins. There is also new power-ups that hinder the opponent.</desc>

Unlike the version for Windows, Wii, Playstation 2 and Xbox 360, which is a full fledged 3D action adventure game combined with minigames, the Nintendo DS version focuses completely on the minigames. The plot, combat sequences and puzzle solving have been removed from the game.

The game does comes with 120 different Olympic challenges. The challenges are divided in 4 categories: Roman, Greek, Gallic and Egyptian. Each challenged is played by rubbing the stylus over the touchpad in a certain way or in a few cases blowing into the microphone. Challenges range from actual Olympic sports like disc throwing to children's games like hula hoops. Players need to obtain at least a bronze medal to continue to the next challenge.</desc>

There are a variety of ATVs and five modes to choose from. The modes are practice, quick race, championship race circuit, championship pro circuit and a multiplayer head-to-head mode.

The game includes a virtual garage in which players can upgrade their ATVs through a touch-screen interface. Tires, suspension, etc can be replaced.</desc>

	<desc>Avalon Code is a hack and slash Action-RPG that takes place in a world about to end.  Choosing between a male or female avatar, the player is given the Book of Prophecy from which the world will be remade.  Everything in the world can be scanned and recorded into the Book of Prophecy, and players can further redefine an entry's properties by mixing and matching pieces of code.  

Codes in Avalon Code are Tetris-like chunks which fit into each book entry's grid of available code space. Think of these codes like genes in a DNA sequence that you can grab and move with the stylus. For example, elemental properties (such as fire) can be incorporated into a weapon, allowing you to melt ice. Removing codes from enemies allows you to weaken them, making them easier to dispatch.

Players string together light combos and can perform charged special moves. Additionally, the player can begin a Judgment Link which juggles the enemy higher and higher (with proper timing) which yields precious HP, MP and Gem bonuses. Dungeons are somewhat unique in that each room is a timed challenge, with requirements such as hitting all switches, defeating all enemies, Judgment Linking xN, and/or various combinations of these.</desc>

With the original Regenerator destroyed beyond repair, the trio must head to planet Earth to rescue Stoker, who can help them create another.

Biker Mice From Mars is a hybrid of a racing game, and a side-scrolling beat-em-up. Take the role of Vinnie, Modo or Throttle, and race against opponents as well as beating them up in your quest to rescue the planet Mars. During the racing sections of the game, you can fire rockets at your foes (once collected from crates scattered on the track), or boost ahead of opponents. You're also racing against a time limit, and must make it to the end of the track before time is up. Destroying enemies will add precious seconds to your timer.

The beat-em-up sections are fairly straightforward. You walk to the end of each stage, beating up opponents with punches and kicks as you progress. The screen locks into place when a group of enemies appear, and you must beat them before you can move on. The mice can also pick up thrown grenades and throw them back at enemies, as well as climb up and down certain objects to take different paths.</desc>

Bionicle Heroes DS is a classic first-person shooter. As a nameless Matoran, you'll travel across 25 themed levels (including jungles, lava-worlds, ancient underground temples) discovering new weapons and new robotic foes to blast apart. Along the way, you'll use the masks' powers to survive the hostile environments as well as collect gears and robot parts to solve simple puzzles by assembling LEGO-style ramps, bridges, and doorways.

The levels in the game are populated by a large visual variety of Bionicle-inspired bad guys, including ones that transform, fly, roll, or charge at you with scorpion-like stingers. Fortunately, you'll be able to upgrade your weapons and destroy them with plasma blasts, lightning, and sniper lasers.

The game also contains a robust local multiplayer mode that allows up to 4-players to compete in deathmatches in arenas laden with weapon and mask upgrades.</desc>

You will gain abilities along the way that will aid you in your adventure. There is the Bomb Kick, Remote Bomb, Power Bomb, and many others. If a wall or enemy stands in your way, just blow it up. Many puzzles and bosses await you in this adventure.

Bomberman's main attraction is the multi-player mode. Up to 8 can battle with just a single game-card. There are 30 stages to play with many different options to choose from. If you are alone, you can still play the battle mode against up to 7 computer controlled bots. There are also voice controlled stages that allow you to plant or blow up your bombs at the sound of your voice.</desc>

	<desc>Bomberman Land Touch! is the second Bomberman game for the Nintendo DS (Bomberman being the first game) and it changes the usual gameplay of Bomberman for a mix of adventure and mini-games.

In the story mode, all the bombermen travel to Bomber Island, a pirate theme park, invited by Giant Gold (yellow bomberman), whose father is rich and has rented the park for a day. The goal of Giant Gold is to conquer the island with the help of the rest of the bombermen, all of which are named after their colors: Cheerful White (the player), Giant Gold, Cool Black, Kid Blue, Pretty Pink (the only girl) and Bookworm Green. 

Once the game starts, we control Cheerful White and we can explore the whole island, which consists in 5 different areas: Spades (the starting point), Diamonds, Hearts and Clubs area, where pieces of the same name can be collected, and the castle. This pieces are collected mostly by winning at mini-games, which are usually based on bombs and serve as the attractions of the park, and are used to open new areas of the map. There is also plenty of characters that give you useful information or send you to solve some quest. The rest of the bombermen will also give you info and quests, and sometimes they will wait you at some of the attractions that you finished and challenge you to it.

In addition to this game mode, there is the Attraction mode and Battle mode, both multiplayer. In the first one, all the attractions already won can be replayed. In the Battle mode, which is played only with buttons (unlike in the other two modes), the multiplayer mode of the previous Bomberman is recovered. The only difference between both battle modes (as modes, levels, option etc. are exactly the same) is that each of the contenders have to have their own cartridge of the game in the Land Touch version.</desc>

After enough experience is obtained, they will level up and gain a new skill like increased number of bombs or fire power.

There are also various types of bombs that can be obtained that have different functions. They are kept in a specific quantity and more can be found from inside soft blocks or defeated monsters.</desc>

In November 2006, PopCap Games released a sequel, Bookworm Adventures. Bookworm was released for the Nintendo DS digital distribution service DSiWare on November 30, 2009.[2] It has also been released on the regular Nintendo DS cartridge.[3]</desc>

This 3rd-person action game features intuitive controls enabling the player to shoot, take cover, flank, and out-maneuver the enemy in a variety of battles actually fought in by American paratroopers during the war, while the DS touch-screen allows for squad command. Multi-player features a variety of different gameplay modes for up to four players.</desc>
	<path>./Bubble Bobble - Double Shot (USA) (En,Fr,Es).nds</path>
	<desc>Bubble-blowing dragons Bub and Bob return (now with buddy Bubu in tow) for a more traditional 2D platform romp than earlier DS title Bubble Bobble Revolution, still however retaining some of its gameplay innovations.

The basic gameplay is as has lasted the test of time: expelling bubbles from their mouths, the adorable dragons first incapacitate monsters by enveloping them in bubbles, then put them out of commission by popping the containing bubble (replacing the enemy with a tasty piece of fruit!) -- each level ending with every enemy popped, through ten worlds of ten levels each with a boss fight at the end of each world. A trapped monster, if left unpopped, will eventually free itself, now red, angry, fast and aggressive, and if it takes too long for the dragons to clean up a level, the notorious invincible ghost whale "Baron von Blubba" appears to turn up the heat.

Things escalate in complexity quite quickly, however, considering that each dragon blows a different colour of bubble -- and that some enemies (designated by colour-coded stars) can only be trapped by certain-coloured bubbles. (Complicating things further, some enemies need to be trapped by combinations of two differently-coloured bubbles before they're down for the count. These elements remain even in single-player mode, where the player has the option of toggling their colour mid-game to produce the necessary bubble colour.)

An array of traditional power-ups (shot distance, movement speed, etc.), weapons (lightning bolts, floods and firebombs) and bonuses (freeze enemies, invincibility, flood level, etc.) remain in effect, as does the longstanding E-X-T-E-N-D bonus mechanism -- here regulated (among other effects) through subtle machinations of the new star bubble type.

When player lives are expended, the option of continuing is granted according to player performance in mini-games making use of the DS touchscreen and stylus, ramping up in difficulty through every continue used.</desc>

	<desc>After her sailboat crashed in Mount Tikikola Beach, Patty Melton decided to start a new life. She gets a work at Beach Burger. To her surprise, the owners decide to retire and leave her their business. Now, as the main "chef" in Beach Burger, Patty has to spread her franchise all the way to the capital city of Honochuchu.

Burger Island is an action game which simulates a burger restaurant. The player has to prepare burgers, shakes and fries made of over 30 different recipes. The gameplay consists in clicking in the ingredients and placing them in the correct order for each recipe. For a hamburger, for instance, the player has to click in the burger stack to pick one and then click in the grill to start frying it. The player has to wait for it to get well done and then place it in the bread, adding ketchup and the top slice. Each order has a time limit to be done, or else the customer will quit waiting. Also, Patty starts working at 10:30 AM and ends at 9:00 PM, and has to reach a daily goal. If she fails to reach it, she'll lose a life.

Each stage has a different kind of order to be prepared, being it burgers, shakes or fries. At first, Patty knows only one recipe of each kind of order, but in between levels new recipes can be bought. New recipes are harder to prepare, but are also more expensive. Earning more money is necessary as the stages go by due to the higher goals to be reached. As the daily shift remains the same, more expensive recipes are needed to reach the daily goal.

The game has a total of 60 levels and three difficulty levels.</desc>

	<desc>First installation of the Burnout-series on handheld consoles combines the best features of the first three games: Burnout, Burnout 2: Point of Impact, and Burnout 3: Takedown.  Aggressive racing is still the centerpiece attraction of Burnout Legends and the player's task is not only to win the races but also crash opponent cars as much as possible.  Opponent takedowns, drifts, and other stunts award Burnout Points which in turn unlock new cars and other awards.

One player games can be played as single events or as a World Tour where the player needs to compete in different races and succeed in them in order to advance through five car classes (Compact, Muscle, Coupe, Sport, and Super). In addition there is the Crash mode, where the goal is to create as much wreckage as possible by ploughing the player car into the traffic.

	<desc>Jill is a young baker who acquired her passion for baking from her grandparents in their bakery, Evans Bakery.  When she returned from culinary school, she discovered Evans Bakery closed down because a "Mega-Mart" moved in.  Jill decides to show the mega corporation what her family's baking is all about and opened her own bakery in order to earn enough money to buy back Evans Bakery. Can Jill handle the pressure of running her own business and beat Mega-Mart?

In Cake Mania, your job is to help Jill meet the monthly quota through 48 progressively difficult levels. This is no simple task because you will have to bake quickly as well as serve the customers quickly. 

There are a variety of different customers to serve. From nice old ladies to impatient holiday icons like Cupid! Each kind of customer have a different patience-level (indicated by the number of hearts). The longer they wait, the lower their patience. If they get too low, they will storm off and cost you money!

When a customer first enters your bakery, hand them a menu. Then they will give you their order (in the form of a thought bubble) and you will have to create that cake. If you create the wrong cake (wrong shape or wrong frosting, etc) then you will have to throw it away and start over (costing you more money). You start off with one oven and one frosting machine. Between levels you will have the opportunity to purchase upgrades or new items that will improve the bakery's. For example, you can purchase upgrade your oven to one that bakes faster or you can purchase a T.V. that will help improve customers' patience.</desc>

	<desc>Following the tradition of the Petz series for PC, the series starts now in Nintendo's handheld.

Catz, along with Dogz, is the first of this series for the DS. It's a pet simulation game, where the player can choose between 5 different races of cats. The goal is basically to care for you cat, that is, bath it when it is dirty, feed it when it is hungry, cure it when it is sick, etc. Additionally, many traditional toys for cats are present in Catz to play with your pet, such us, fake mice, small balls with bells inside, etc.

But once in a while, the in-game PDA will show an alert. Here, the game will give interesting real-life advices about cat-caring, and also tasks to be performed by the player. Succeeding at these tasks, like caring for cats of other non-player characters, will traduce into coins, that give the player the opportunity to buy both, toys and costumes for your pet or furniture and decoration objects for the house. And you can also be rewarded with "Kitty Cardz", that give hints on cat-caring or tell facts about them.

Catz is also a multiplayer game. In two-player multi-card mode, Cardz and photos of the kittens can be shared with friends.</desc>

Classic mode: Hunt as many chickens as you can in a single stage to reach the highest score under a time limit. It's essentially the classic chicken shoot.

Weight mode: In weight mode chickens approach by air. Move side to side and fire your hefty cannon to the right chicken depending of the color of your weight (your bullet). Three weights of the same color to the same chicken and you've done your main objective.

Gems mode: Here you cannot move side to side. You must shoot the chickens to make them release a gem where three metallic containers reside. Line up the gems to get extra points just like the classic Columns game.

Hotwire mode: A kind of racing game in which you control your car with your stylus. Your job is to drag your car left or right to avoid hitting the side of the track. Every time that you finish the track the speed is increased.

Spot the difference mode: Use Nintendo DS dual screen you'll have to find the differences between two images. The right picture is in the upper screen and you'll have to tap the differences in the touch screen with your stylus.</desc>

	<path>./Chicken Shoot (USA) (En,Fr,De,Es,It).nds</path>
	<desc>Chicken Shoot is a gallery shooting game based on free 2003 flash game of the same name. The player shoots all the chickens that appear on the 2D hand-drawn screens. The top screen is used to show the gameplay, while the bottom one shows statistics such as the remaining time, the score, the type of gun and the remaining ammo. The game can be controlled through the buttons, or in combination with the stylus to aim at the chickens.

The basic game modes are identical to those of the Wii version: Arcade (shoot a specific number of chickens), Classic (time limit) and Catch an Egg (a mini-game where eggs need to be caught before they drop on the ground). Different kinds of guns can be picked up and every now and then enemies thrown an egg towards the screen that needs to be blown up quickly. Extra points are awarded for shooting certain background items, bombs destroy everything on the screen, food can be picked up to refill energy (Arcade) and clocks add more time (Classic). There are six levels/environments: The Village, The Forest, Nevada Desert, Antarctica, Rocky Island and Sahara.

There are two multi-player modes: cooperative gameplay for two players or a four-player competitive game mode where players need to score as much points as possible in a set amount of time.</desc>

	<desc>Some years before the action begins, a great catastrophe began at the base of the Mana Tree. This gives the main characters, Ferrik, Tamber, Poppen and Wanderer, who's parents were killed in the disaster, reason to find out what happened. The game takes place on the Island of Illusia, at the center of which lies the Mana Tree.

The game is a real time Action/RPG very similar to the style of Secret of Mana. New features include dual weapon systems, so characters can use one long range and one melee weapon at a time. 

Although there is much more that can be done with each weapon, there are only four in the game, as opposed to twice as many in previous titles.

The game supports Wireless LAN for 4 players.</desc>

When Crono meets a young girl named Marle, little does he realize that this young girl, his best friend Lucca's invention, and a mysterious pendant will thrust him into the ultimate trip through time and space, encountering new friends, defeating the forces of evil, and encountering the one who would destroy the flow of time.

Chrono Trigger is a role-playing game, with the usual game mechanics fare for such: the player takes control of a variably large party, developing the combat skills of its members and managing their equipment. As the characters grow in power, not only their ability scores increase, but they also learn new "Techs" - special powerful attacks and maneuvers which cost them "Magic Points" to use in battle. 

The game utilizes the ATB (active time battle) combat system from Final Fantasy games - sort of a mix of turn-based and real-time combat - adding to it combo attacks. Apart from normal Techs, it is possible to use Double and Triple Techniques - super-powerful attacks which involve two or three characters using their abilities at once. There are no random battles in the game, as all the enemies are visible on screen, and it's even possible to just pass by them entirely. 

The game allows you to face your ultimate adversary at different points of time, which leads to several different endings. There is also a New Game+ option, which allows you to carry over your powerful characters to a new game, and adds even more endings to the already existing ones.</desc>
	<path>./Chronos Twin (Europe) (En,Fr,De,Es,It).nds</path>
	<desc>When a mysterious alien being arrives on planet Skyla, the planet's inhabitants tried to make peace with it.  However, its intentions were anything but... destroying all in its wake and forcing the planet's inhabitants to flee as none of their weapons could even harm it.  Study revealed that the alien was able to exist in two different times simultaneously, and could only be harmed in both.  A special time machine was built - one that can transport someone into the past and the present at the same time...

Chronos Twin is a side-scrolling platform game with a difference - the action takes place on both Nintendo DS screens simultaneously. The top screen shows the player in the present, while the touch screen shows the player in the past. Pressing the A Button will make both the past and present player jump simultaneously. While there are certain differences in the past and the present (for example, a platform in the past may not exist in the present), as long as the player is standing on the platform in one time period, they won't fall.

The player also has a weapon at their disposal - a gun which can be fired in the present with the X Button, and the past with the B Button. However - the gun cannot be fired in both time periods simultaneously. The gun can also be charged up by holding down the button, releasing a more powerful blast.

After a certain point in the game, the player is also able to stop time in one period while moving about freely in another period. This can be used to move blocks to allow both present and past players to get through, or to release platforms that a player in one time period couldn't reach.</desc>

	<desc>Code Lyoko is a game based on the French animated television series. Five boarding school students - Ulrich, Odd, Jeremy and Yumi - fight against a digital entity named X.A.N.A. They travel to the virtual world of Lyoko and help their virtual friend Aelita fend off X.A.N.A.s forces.

The game follows both aspects of the kids' lives, and the player can enjoy 3D Action Role Playing within the world of Lyoko and 2D Adventuring in the real world.

The game is made of 15 chapters, and each chapter is split into two portions. One portion is a PC-style 2D point-and-click adventure, where you take control of one of the characters to visit different locations, talk to people, gather items, and generally watch the story unfold. The other portion is a 3D action level where you swap among characters and use their abilities to fight monsters, hop between platforms, or climb up hillsides in search of the tower that'll put and end to whatever problem is currently pestering the real world. Occasionally, the player has to solve touch-screen puzzles and pass vehicle-based levels.</desc>
	<path>./Color Cross (USA) (En,Fr,Es).nds</path>
	<desc>Color Cross is a picture puzzle game similar to Picross, where the objective is to fill all the correct cells in a grid to form a picture. Each row and column has a series of numbers as clues, indicating the groups of continuous cells that must be painted. The player must use logic to discover the remaining spots and complete the figure.

The main difference this time is the addition of multiple colors per picture, instead of the monochromatic approach of other titles. Players can select back and forth between colors by clicking on the palette at the side of the screen. Cells can be painted individually or as a group by clicking and dragging across them with the cursor. In each color option, cells can be marked with an X to point them out as incorrect places. Any mistakes are corrected automatically, affecting the final score.

New levels are unlocked with each completed picture. They are organized by picture theme at the level selection menu. Every time a line or column is completed, the clue numbers become grayed out and a shower of candies, fairies and other theme-related items fall from it to the bottom of the screen.</desc>

He and his assistant, Terry, have crash-landed on an unknown island, and the professor needs to make repairs to his ship.  Subtly guide Terry around the island (and later on, the world!) to help them both.

Contact is an adventure game with a difference. The professor from the game is aware of your presence, but his assistant, Terry, is not. You indirectly control Terry by moving him around the game world and issue commands to him. Every action that Terry makes has a corresponding statistic, and these can be levelled up by using them frequently. Run everywhere, and Terry's speed will increase. Take damage, and while your health will decrease, your stamina will increase, allowing you to take more hits. Steal items and your thievery skills will increase, and so on.

The game also supports the Nintendo Wi-Fi Connection. Swap Friend Codes with other people, and when you connect to their game on the Internet, you'll be able to exchange data, as well as send an NPC version of your character into their copy of the game.</desc>

The heroes of the original Contra series - Billy Rizer and Lance Bean as well as two newcomers - Mad Dog and Scorpion are now humanity's last line of defense against total annihilation.

This installment of the long-running series adds dual screen gameplay, enabling the player a wider view, and a 2-player co-op mode via local Wi-Fi connection. Each player is now given two weapon slots which can be filled with any one of the game's many weapon power-ups and switched at will with a press of a shoulder button. The game features nine levels set in such classic Contra locations as Jungle, Waterfall and a pseudo-3D Base.
As a bonus, the cartridge contains an illustrated history of Contra, as well as the Contra and Super C original NES games.</desc>

The player takes orders from various customers and then has to prepare the to fit their order and to satisfy their tastes. The way the meal is prepared is up to the player, and a number of different ingredients are available.

Each preparation section is timed, as well as this, players are marked on the final product.

The touch screen is used to slice and soak vegetables, marinade meat, peel fruit and of course cook it on the stove.

The screen allows for more sensitive and easier interaction allowing a more realistic and hands on cooking experience than a mouse or controller could.</desc>

Crosswords DS uses handwriting detection to let the user input their answer into each crossword puzzle. Puzzles range from easy to master difficulty, with special 'themed' crosswords becoming unlocked after you solve a page of twenty crosswords. After you complete a puzzle, you are graded based on how many hints you used, and if you used Entry Assist to help you fill in the crossword. Your completion time is shown as well.

Word searches display a grid of letters on the touch screen. Simply drag the stylus across the letters you think form the word, and if you're correct, the word will be marked off the list. Anagrams gives the player a set of letters - these are used to try and form all the words possible with the combination of letters. Each time you successfully discover a word, it is filled into your list.</desc>

The story has the player's character joining the Robo Team 'Numero Uno' and the story unfolds as they attempt to win the Robo Cup. Like all the Custom Robo games, except the GBA incarnation, the battles are conducted in 3D, with the player attempting to defeat their opponent, in a Pokémon fashion similar to the previous games. The touch screen is used to clean off the player's Robo after it becomes dirty, as this reduces its efficiency.

In another first it offers 2 player multiplayer over Nintendo Wi-Fi and allows voice chat and utilises the rivals system seen in Metroid Prime: Hunters.</desc>

	<desc>In this throwback to the early days of CRPGs you must explore the Dark Spire dungeon with a party of up to four characters.

Party creation is basic by most modern standards. 
Four races, three alignments, four classes along with five different stat points are all there are to decide what your character is.

These four characters begin the game inexperienced and weak like almost every RPG. They gain skills, power and better quality items as they progress through the various dungeons.

Experience points are spent on skills for the characters, some of these opening the choice to upgrade one of the 4 basic classes to become a different prestige class, offering different abilities.

The game is played without use of the touchscreen and only uses the direction pad and buttons. The top screen displays the party location in 3d and the bottom screen has info on their status.</desc>

	<path>./Deal or No Deal (USA).nds</path>
	<desc>Deal or No Deal is based on the TV game show of the same name. It puts one contest against a banker. At the start of the game, the player choose one of the 26 briefcases. They contain prize money ranging from $.01 to $1,000,000. The different amounts are shown on a game board. Each round the player has to open a number of the remaining briefcases which are then marked on the board (six in the first round, five in the second, four in the third). Based on the remaining amount of money, the banker offers the player a deal, a certain amount of money, based on odds. The player can choose to accept the deal when large sums are gone, or decide to go through. After the third round the briefcase is opened and if it contains a higher sum than what the banker offered, the player has made a great deal.

In singleplayer, three modes are available: TV Game (classic gameplay), Vault Game (Find the 3-number combination to a vault in the correct order in as few turns as possible. The initial prize is $500,000 and each turn the prize fund is reduced.) and High Low (Pick a briefcase and then make a calculated guess if the next briefcase will contain a higher or lower sum. For each correct guess, the prize money is increased). Two-player multiplayer offers Head to Head (classic gameplay to get the best deal) or Best Deal where one of the players becomes the banker.

Gameplay consists solely of picking numbers and calculated guesses. No other interactive game elements are present.</desc>

	<path>./Deep Labyrinth (USA).nds</path>
	<desc>Deep Labyrinth is a slow-paced first person dungeon exploration game for Nintendo DS.
The movement is controlled with D-pad, while all of the games attacks are executed through touch-screen. Deep Labyrinths magic system requires the player to draw symbols  Kirie on a 3x3 grid, in order to cast spells. As the game progresses, the Kirie become more and more complex, eventually requiring strings of up to 9 unique symbols.

The game is split into two chapters different enough to be separate games.

In the first chapter tells the story of a boy named Shawn, whose family is stranded on the roadside by a blown tire. His parents go off to find help, but mysteriously vanish. As its getting late, and a storm is approaching Shawn and the family pet  dog named Ace, seek shelter in an apparently abandoned mansion close by, but as they do, both are transported into a bizarre fantasy world. Apparently, this world is a place where unneeded human memories are sent do be erased, and as we find out  Shawns parents memories of him and each other are scheduled for deletion. This sets our hero on a quest to save his family and, perhaps discover the dark secrets of the world of memories.

The second chapter casts you as a hero mysteriously transported into an unnamed dungeon, where he soon discovers a girl trapped in a crystal. The hero has a vague recollection of once knowing the girl, but it is suggested that she died long ago. From that point on the game becomes about escaping the dungeon and saving the girl.

The two chapters are different enough to be separate games. Chapter one is fleshed out with NPCs, dialogue, and story event cutscenes, as well as a several lengthy anime FMVs, while the second chapter is much darker, and features very little in terms of story, focusing on the combat instead.</desc>

	<desc>When Tiger Island is taken over by the evil Wizpig, Timber sends a letter to Diddy to request his assistance.  Diddy, Dixie, Tiny Kong and the rogue Kremling Krunch turn up to help Timber and his friends, Bumper, Tiptup and Pipsy.

Diddy Kong Racing DS is remake of the Nintendo 64 game of the same name. However, while the story and setting remains the same, this is more of an upgrade instead of a port. Players can still race around assorted tracks around Tiger Island via kart, hovercraft or plane, winning races to earn golden balloons to progress and defeating bosses to confront Wizpig.

There have been subtle tweaks to the gameplay. While you can still level up your balloons by collecting another of the same colored balloon in a row, collecting a different colored balloon will not change your weapon - you'll have to fire your current weapon first. The Silver Coin Challenge from the original game has been removed from the main adventure, and is replaced with a first-person touch screen shooter where you fly around on Taj's magic carpet and aim to pop as many balloons as you can. There's also an optional racing mode where you race by using the stylus to guide the vehicle through a top-down map.

The game now supports currency system for most unlockables - dotted along the track are coins, which can be used to buy 'wishes' from Taj the Genie. These include anything from new characters, exclusive tracks, a custom track editor, battle modes to unlock in multiplayer and so forth. The DS version of Diddy Kong Racing also heavily supports multiplayer. You can play with one game card or multiple game cards (to a maximum of eight players), or online to a maximum of six players. Similar to Mario Kart DS, you can design your own custom decal and have it as your visual representation for when you race around the world.</desc>

The gameplay uses many devices from traditional JRPGs, including random encounters and a battle field similar to Dragon Quest. The main goal of the game is to properly raise your team of digital monsters (or Digimon) either by leading them in battle or maintaining them in a Digi-farm. Along the way, you will have to complete dozens of quests which you discover by interacting with your Digimon. When you're not completing side-quests or moving along the main storyline, you can battle and trade with your friends via Wi-Fi.</desc>

Players use the stylus to draw shapes 'magical runes' on the DS touch screen, which then travel towards your opponent on the other side of the playing area. In the playing area is a circular drawing board on which you draw runes that activate your spells, assuming there is currently enough mana to do so. Once cast, a little icon starts moving anti-clockwise around the board, up towards an image of the opponent (at the 12 o'clock position). If it hits your opponent the effects of the spell are manifested, whether it's simply inflicting damage, cursing them with effects. 

Both players players have a shield which can be activated by pressing their own icon (at the six o'clock position). The shield only last few a few seconds before needing to recharge and some spells are able to cut through it, so players need to keep an eye on not only which spells are traveling towards them, but how their spells are likely to be received by their opponent. Tactics are used to combine these runes both in timing and effect.</desc>

	<desc>In the beginning, the Creator built the world and left its people, the lighthearted Raposa, his blueprint -- The Book of Life.

It's been nearly a generation since the Raposa have been in contact with the Creator, and most assume he's left them to take care of themselves. Still, the time has passed peacefully, and the Raposa lived in relative happiness and comfort.

However, the Book of Life has been stolen, and a madman has been reshaping the world according to his own whims. Most of the Raposa have moved away, looking for safer lands, and those who remain plead for the Creator to return and save them from the darkness, which has crept across their village. 

As the Creator, your job is to rebuild your fragmented world, and recover the now missing pages of the Book of Life. Use your stylus and draw your own hero to platform his way to saving the Raposa's world. Along the way, draw your own platforms, vehicles, and all manner of other things. It's up to you to bring color back into the darkened landscape.

The player's character can be drawn for various elements such as torso, head, arms and legs with different color schemes. In the village shop, games, songs, patterns and moves can be bought to travel through the world with 2D-platformer gameplay.</desc>

	<desc>In Electroplankton players interact with various "plankton" to create "media art". Using the DS touch screen, microphone, and other input methods, you can make the plankton to react, creating numerous audio and visual experiences.

There are two modes Performance and Audience. In Audience, the plankton will perform for you, as long as you see fit, or your battery will allow. In Performance you can interact with the plankton and create your own audio-visual show.

The Various Plankton are as follows 

1. Tracy: You will have several plankton. They will move along lines you draw for them, their speed varying on how quickly you drew the lines. The sound they create changes depending on their speed and where they are on the screen. 

2. Hanenbow: These little creatures launch out of a small body of water and bounce off the leaves of plants. Depending on the levees they bounce off of they will create different sounds. 

3. Luminaria: You will have four plankton on a grid. Each has a different speed. Depending on what point on the grid they hit they will make a different sound. Arrows on the grid, that you can alter, will determine where they move. 

4. Sun-Animalcule: You place these little creatures on the screen and they will grow. As the become larger they will create different sounds. 

5. Rec-Rec: Using the mic you can record four samples that then replay with various drumloops. 

6. Nanocarp: These little plankton move about the screen randomly, they will alter how they move according to what you input. Touching one will make it "pling" and clapping twice will make them swim in a circle. 

7. Lumiloop: You spin them around. They glow and make sound according to the direction and speed. 

8. Marine-Snow  Each of these plankton will make a tone when touched, and move about. 

9. Beatnes: Plays NES music and you can create repeating NES-esque music by touching the plankton on various parts of their bodies. 

10. Volvoice: This plankton will record you voiced and the play it back in different ways.</desc>
	<path>./Elements of Destruction (USA).nds</path>
	<desc>In Elements of Destruction the player can unleash the most volatile forces on Earth such as tornadoes, lightning storms, ice storms, earthquakes and meteor storms, wreaking havoc on unsuspecting cities and causing massive amounts of damage and creating complete and utter chaos.

The story tells of a TV weatherman by the name of Marty Storm who is fired from his job for reporting the truth about bad weather conditions instead of lying about good weather conditions in which the station's producer hopes will result in better ratings. Afterwards he vows revenge as his former co-workers ridicule him, unknown to them however, Marty Storm is also a part-time mad scientist that has created a device that can create disasters at will. With this device, Storm goes on a quest to bring the city and his former co-workers to their knees. The gameplay is divided into three weeks (levels) which have seven days, each with their own set of goals. Some consist of causing a set amount of damage, others consist of destroying a certain percentage of building while others consist of destroying certain buildings. These objectives must be done within a certain time limit.

To conjure these storms a menu is on the right side of the bottom screen which has a list of disasters available (some are only available on certain days). After selecting their disaster they use the stylus pen to create a path of destruction for the tornadoes and storms or pick a certain point for either the earthquake or meteors. For the storms and tornadoes, players can click onto them with the stylus and continue to change their path until the run out. Additionally, the player must have a certain amount of energy to be able to select them which regenerates over time or can be obtained by destroying buildings. To help the player, a mini-map is also located at the top of the screen which shows locations of buildings, which types of buildings they are and the buildings health status.

Each storm also has their own special attacks which are only available after they reach a level three later into the game and can be accessed by clicking an icon above the disaster. The tornado becomes much more powerful and has the ability to cause more damage. The lightning storm can cause fires to buildings which the player can then blow into the DS' microphone to fan the flames and spread them. The ice storm causes a blizzard which will weaken buildings for other storms. The earthquake will become more powerful when the player continually taps the center of the earthquake with the meteor storm has the same effect.

However there are attempts to halt the players progress which certain buildings that can instantly stop the players selected disaster. A tornado trapper can suck up a tornado while a cloud cruncher takes out lightning and ice storms. The seismic nullifer prevents earthquakes while the meteor shield keeps meteors from destroying buildings and the weather sucker stops both tornadoes and storms. The storm free zone building prevents any disaster from being performed around it and a weather repeller bounces storms and tornadoes off of them. There are also two types of drones that come in from time to time: a repairing drone will fly around and repair a building while a rebuilding drone will instantly bring a building back without any time to rebuild it. The player can use the lightning storm to hover above these drones and destroy them.

Power-ups are also scattered throughout the level which will upgrade their storm or disaster to the next level for a brief amount of time. To use these power-ups, the player must have their storm or disaster consume them, however the color much match the disaster that is being used, otherwise the power-up will have no effect.

There are also multiplayer modes that support up to three different players. A race mode lets players complete a certain set of objectives given to them with the winner being the first player to complete them. There is also a Tug-of-War where the main objective is to either have the largest amount of destruction monetary wise or through a certain percentage.</desc>

	<desc>Elite Beat Agents is the spiritual sequel to Osu! Tatakae! Ouendan!  In this rhythm-based music game, the Elite Beat Agents are a special task force dedicated to helping people in need and righting wrongs through the power of song. 

The game is played entirely through use of the stylus. Timing is required to line up the rings that close in on the circles to ensure the proper beat for the song. Beats can also be scored by dragging a glowing ball through a set line area until the end of a beat. Finally, players will be required to turn a spinner as quickly as possible during a music break.

The level stories are mostly comedic, where the Agents will help a girl and her jock boyfriend go steady, help a speeding taxi driver deliver a baby, and even help a weather reporter chase away rain clouds to go on a picnic with her son. Each level is accompanied by popular songs such as Madonna's "Material Girl", Chicago's "You're the Inspiration", or Jamiroquai's "Canned Heat", among others, for 19 music tracks total.

Multiplayer allows gamers to compete against each other via single-card or multi-card play.</desc>

	<path>./Etrian Odyssey (USA).nds</path>
	<desc>Far away in a vast fertile land lies a small town called Etria.  Peaceful and serene, Etria became famous when a labyrinth was discovered at the edge of its woods.  Those who heard of the labyrinth began to harbor dreams of exploring it.  And so many explorers from all over the world flocked to Etria in dream of achieving wealth, fame, and fortune exploring the vast and mysterious labyrinth.

Etrian Odyssey is a first-person RPG which pits you as an eager adventurer ready to face the dangers of the labyrinth. At the beginning of the game you are required to create your own "adventuring guild" by creating various characters out of 9 different classes. You can create as many as you want, but everything costs money, so strategic thinking is a must. As well, you can only take a party of 5 into the labyrinth, so the remaining characters have to stay in town at the guild hall. Battles are done in the traditional turn-based style, and he game contains over 125 monsters that guard the labyrinth and the area around it. Movement is done one step at a time, with players moving in restricted directions (forward, back, left right). Most of the game is focused on exploring deeper and deeper into the labyrinth while still returning to town in order to restock and resupply. During the return trips to town, you can also switch out characters in your party if a special class is needed to pass obstacles in the labyrinth. Also, players are only allowed to save during the return trip to town, making trips to the labyrinth both risky and exciting.

The labyrinth is completely unknown and unexplored, and so one of the important features of the game is the necessity to draw your own maps. The top screen of the DS shows the action, while the bottom screen shows a gridded area. In this area, you have to use the stylus to draw out all of your maps. This means not only marking where the walls and doors are, but having to mark where enemies, treasures, special areas, and staircases are. It is completely up to you how accurately or haphazardly you want to draw your map. However, the only way to get out of the labyrinth is to return to the start, so the gameplay becomes even riskier the further you venture into the dungeon. Managing your map poorly may risk you and party's lives. Map making is a key concept of this game because it emphasizes adventuring into the unknown and finding out what's around the very next corner.</desc>

To do so, the player must move Mr. Esc and the Escapees, either with the stylus or the control pad, and have them perform various actions throughout the puzzle-like levels, such as moving boxes, extinguishing flames and breaking icicles.

Each different character possess a different set of abilities and problems. For example, Large People can push heavier objects, but need the help of two Adults to climb higher than 1 meter.

Each level has a timer that indicates the time limit for the current stage. Depending on how fast the level was completed, the player gets a score up to 100%.</desc>

	<desc>Fantasy Aquarium by DS is a fish tank simulation. Contrary to Aquarium by DS by the same developer, which is limited to "normal" aquarium suiting fishes, the player of this game can choose from 30 different underwater animals which can't be held in fish tanks in real life (e.g. whales, dolphins, sharks, penguins). Additionally, the player can customize their tank in size and add different backgrounds and accessories like plants, rocks or even buildings like the Leaning Tower of Pisa. New fish types can be unlocked by taking good care of the aquariums residents.

And that's the aim of the game, taking care of the fishes in the tank. They need to be fed, the tank has to be cleaned and water temp and salinity have to be adjusted to create a perfect environment. A wrong environment or an unsuitable mix of animals in the tank, for example killer whales and penguins at the same time, will result in the death of the players pets. Instead of swimming dead at the surface or bloody death animations they simply disappear from the screen. Not playing the game for a few days and therefore not feeding, will result in a deadly surprise, too.

Using the Wi-Fi-feature of the DS the player can swap fishes with other players.</desc>

The game can be played with either buttons, or the for the DS unique stylus control. Movement is done with the control pad, all other actions can be done with the stylus. Shooting is done by sliding the stylus towards the goal, while passes are made by touching in the direction of a team mate. When defending a slide is used for tackling. 

Doing tricks is a central part of the series and this DS iteration is no different with a number of different moves. These are done by combining different stylus slides. For each successful trick, the player is awarded trick points that increases his gamebreaker meter. Once full the gamebreaker can be triggered.

Raised as an orphan by Nina and Elder Topapa in the village of Ur, Luneth, his shy friend Arc, the rebellious Refia and the brave soldier Ingus are chosen as the Four Warriors of Light to send to restore balance to the crystals, and save the world from imminent destruction.

Taking the original game which debuted on the NES, Square-Enix had updated the title with a new cinematic intro, improved graphics and a touch-screen interface to move characters and utilize selection menus. There is also Moogle Mail, a Wi-Fi feature that allows players to send messages to each other via their DS systems. The game has also some revised story elements, detailing the adventures of four friends who find each other, each with new backstories.

Final Fantasy III is a traditional turn-based RPG, which were popular back in the '80s and '90s, but introduced refinements to the genre, such as smarter battle AI. Final Fantasy III is also known for two major milestones in the history of the series: Its introduction of the cheerful Moogles, as well as the introduction of the job system, allowing characters to switch professions throughout the game for new abilities.</desc>
	<path>./Final Fantasy IV (USA) (En,Fr,Es).nds</path>
	<desc>Final Fantasy IV is a remake of the classic Japanese RPG that was first released for SNES, known as  Final Fantasy II in the West. 

Unlike the many subsequent ports (to Playstation, GameBoy Advance, etc.), this release is a full remake, programmed from scratch with real-time 3D graphics. The characters have a "super-deformed" touch. There is also voice acting during cut-scenes. A new option has been added to the menu, which allows the player to read a conversation between party members and receive advice from them.

It also features many gameplay additions. The difficulty level has been increased, not only beyond the difficulty of the Western SNES release (which was reduced compared to Japanese original and subsequent ports), but even beyond the original difficulty. The party members are still bound by class, but they can now hunt for so-called "augments", which can be found or stolen from enemies and which grant the characters additional bonus abilities, resistances, spells that their class would normally not allow, etc. 

Beside those major changes, there are also plenty of minor additions. It is possible to obtain bonus items after exploring every corner and filling 100% of an area map; Rydia, the summoner girl, has a new monster summon who can be customized in various ways; there is a new quest involving the "naming" moogle of the original game, etc.</desc>

This game is an action flight sim with a twist - it also has RPG elements. Each enemy plane you shoot down earns your experience points and gold, which unlocks better parts and planes for you to buy. Occasionally during flight you receive mayday calls from other planes under attack - if you are able to save them you can meet them back at the nearest airfield for a reward.

If the action is too much for you to handle, it has an autopilot mode which allows you to select targets and waypoints via the touchscreen. There is also a 4 player multicard mode where you can go head to head with friends.</desc>

	<desc>Glory Days 2 takes the premise of Choplifter! and cranks it up a few notches. A strategic component was added that melds old gameplay with new game concepts. There are a lot of playable vehicles that become unlocked as you advance in the game.

The overall goal of the game is to provide air support for your ground troops as they advance and capture enemy bunkers, ultimately pushing them back enough that they retreat. Players can choose from three aviators and there are sixteen missions in total, moving on in time from classic WWII aircraft to modern day helicopters and F14's.

The strategical component allows the player to take command of ground units and manage funds to build new units. These funds are acquired by completing missions such as saving civilians or capturing bases. Progressively, more powerful units and weapons become available. Multiplayer is supported for up to eight players over Wi-Fi, split into two cooperative teams where the enemy's command centre needs to be taken out. The setup of the battles is completely customizable for different parameters.

Optionally, 3D glasses are supported to add more depth to the action on the screens.</desc>

	<desc>Following the tradition of the Petz series for PC, Ubisoft brings now the series to the DS. This time with hamsters.

Like in other games of the series for the DS, the player has to care for his/her pet by feeding it, bathing it, brushing it and other such tasks. There are five different breeds to choose from and seven mini-games that randomly appear to give you food, costumes, toys and items for the cage where the hamsters live. And thanks to the wireless connection to other DSs, hamsters and other items can be shared with friends. The player can even store information on up to other 20 different owners.

Due to its Japanese origin, there are plenty of anime art elements in the game, for instance, and many other Japanese oddities like the possibility to teach your hamster to talk or store the blood type of other players. In addition, in Hamsterz the main goal is to raise your hamster in order for him to make itself a complete "Ham-country" (sic.), where it can build plenty of buildings like a school, a bakery, etc., making this the game of the series where the pet can behave closest to an actual human.</desc>

Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire for the Nintendo DS and Game Boy Advance is a top-down action/adventure game where you play as the three friends and progress through the story based on the book and film.

Make your way through various scenarios by attacking enemies and solving puzzles using spells. One button fires a ranged spell, such as Confoundus, while another is used for stream spells, like Wingardium Leviosa, which can be moved around with the Control Pad. You can also call your friends for added power to your magical spells.

The DS version includes a small bonus game where you take care of a magical creature called a 'Niffler'. It is a simulation game, like a very simple Tamagotchi. You can feed the Niffler, clean it, and give it toys - depending on what you do, it will become more or less pleased with you. Perform well enough, and it will become really happy, and let you pat it to make it even happier.</desc>

The gameplay consists in various minigames, which you play either by pressing buttons on the right timing (GBA) or by doing different kinds of moves with your stylus on the touch-screen (DS).</desc>

	<path>./Hello, Pocoyo! (Europe) (En,Fr,De,Es,It).nds</path>
	<desc>Hello Pocoyo! is the first console game based on Pocoyo, the award winning animated series created and developed by Zinkia. 

The story takes place when Pocoyo, a curious, fun-loving and friendly little boy, makes disappear all his friends using a magic marker. Pocoyo will travel through the desert, the space, the forest and the rest of scenery's of the series until finding all of them. 

The game is a graphical adventure specially designed for players from 6 years old. Puzzles require some creative thinking but also a little bit of skill from time to time. Everything is placed in the world to make the player feel he is involved in an adventure in which his teammates are Pocoyo and the rest of the characters.

Players will have to use his memory and musical skills, color lots of paintings, use a magnifying glass to decipher images, blow to the microphone to make characters fly using a balloon Besides, the player will take control of Pato, Elly and Loula, who will be joining the troupe as the player and Pocoyo find them. Each of these characters have some unique abilities that will be needed in certain parts of the game. 

Hello Pocoyo! includes a contextual help system to prevent players getting stuck. Also, the amount of text used in the game is minimal, since the main part of the story is told with pre-rendered cinematics, the voice over of the narrator of the series, and lots of pictures and images spread around the levels of the game.</desc>

	<desc>Heroes of Mana is a continuation of Square Enix's, World of Mana series, but with a new twist in the gameplay.  This time around the gameplay is now real-time, where players can build bases and their own armies consisting of humans, monsters and rabites throughout the Mana series.

The story takes place when a witch by the name of Anise brought darkness to the land, unleashing hordes of monsters on the world. She is eventually defeated by the guardians of the trees, but the evil she unleashed was unable to me stopped until the Mana Goddess uses the Mana Sword to seal off the darkness in eight stones, bringing peace to the world. This is where the players takes control of the main protagonist, Roget, a younger warrior who has learned that somehow the evil is coming back into the world and must embark on a quest with 10 other comrades and countless created units and stop the evil forces from being unleashed again.

The player uses the stylus mostly throughout the game, touching on a certain character and touching somewhere on the screen to move them around or draw circles around multi characters to move them all at once. Players do battle by selecting their unit and tapping enemy units with the stylus to use that units attack skill on that selected enemy. Players can also build building and units to help them out by gathering two resources throughout the game, Gaia (which is responsible for buildings) and Treant (for units) all of which is located in the players main base, a large ship. Each unit has a different skill, some are good against enemy units others are used for resource gathering.

Friends can also compete through Wi-Fi head-to-head as well as see their ranking against other players. Players can also earn bonus items and maps through this if their ranking is high enough. The music is also composed by Yoko Shimomura who is also responsible for music in games such as Kingdom Hearts, Legend of Mana and Super Mario RPG as well.</desc>

	<desc>Following the tradition of the Petz series for PC, Ubisoft brings now the series to the DS. This time with horses.

In Horsez the player plays Ginger, a young girl that receives a pony from a friend that leaves the country. Horsez is one of the Petz games that focuses mainly on training your pet in order to participate in competitions. As usual, there is also caring tasks like feeding, bathing, brushing, etc. so the pony grows healthy and strong, but the final goal will still be to train your horse in cross, jump and dressage and win at horse sport events worldwide. Other traditional elements of the series, like dressing your horse and Ginger for exhibition purposes or even toys when the player still owns a foal, also appear in Horsez.

As for the wireless gameplay, in addition to the usual sharing of pets with other game owners, there is also the possibility to send sick horses to the Imagine: Animal Doctor.</desc>

	<desc>In Hotel Giant DS the player is responsible for managing a hotel. In principle the game is played similar to Hotel Giant 2 but adjusted to the capabilities of the platform. The first big difference is that there is no classic free playing mode but only 15 missions where the player needs to reach certain goals. Mostly the player takes over a half-finished hotel and needs to finish furnishing the rooms. The available items were reduced to the most necessary.

When the hotel opens its doors the most time is spent with attending to the cusomer's complaints. After beating a mission it can be played again with self-determined goals. The game is played in real-time but can be paused at any time. A save option is available after every day. There is also a mini game when the player doesn't want to hire cleaners: troubles are indicated with a flash on the mini map. When clicking on it the player needs to make a fast move with the stylus.</desc>

	<desc>I Spy Fun House is another digital adaptation of the long-running series of children's books by Walter Wick, this time with an amusement park theme. The objective is to find and click on all the objects described in a verse at the bottom, on screens depicting locations and attractions of the park. The objects move or display a little animation after being clicked to indicate the correct selection. After all the required items are found, the verse is replaced with a final clue to a hidden ticket.

The tickets unlock new areas and mini-games. Eleven tickets are necessary to enter the Fun House area, while extra tickets open the mini-games. These bonus games are implementations of classic concepts, where the player has to match tiles by swapping pairs on concentric circles, fit tetrominoes shapes inside the limited space of a box, click on the differences between several similar pictures and other challenges. There are no hints or hint button available to show the location of the objects, and no time limit or penalty for wrong clicks.

The Windows/Macintosh CD-ROM release includes a 3-inch promotional mini-disc, containing one riddle from each of three earlier I Spy games: I Spy Fantasy, I Spy Spooky Mansion Deluxe, and I Spy Treasure Hunt.</desc>

	<desc>In six hours the evil Professor Elvin Atombender's nuclear missiles will launch and destroy strategic locations on the earth. Only one agent can infiltrate his secret base and undertake this Impossible Mission.

The goal of Impossible Mission is to acquire nine passwords and bring these to Atombender's Control Room in time to shut down the rockets. Unfortunately these passcodes (contained on punch cards) have been broken into four pieces each, and each piece hidden in computers, furniture, and waste bins throughout the base. On top of that Atombender has an entire army of robots patrolling the base. If a robot touches or shocks the agent then ten minutes are removed from the clock and the room is reset. The agent can jump over robots, but the only way to stop them is to expend a specific item on a room's computer terminal, and even that only disables them for a few seconds.

The 2007 release of the game has a few improvements over the original version, mostly to improve the graphics and make the game easier. The player can select one of three agents, although all of them possess the same abilities. Robots are now color coded according to what they are capable of doing (yellow only patrol, red patrol and shock, blue can follow and shock), but some aspects of each robot's personality can still only be figured out by watching or approaching them. Finally an easy mode has been added that adds an extra two hours to the clock and marks rooms which you have cleared out of items. The original mode with the original graphics can also be played, as well as a "mixed" mode that uses the old avatar graphics, makes all robots the same color, but keeps any other graphical upgrades.</desc>

	<desc>Growing up as a second class citizen on a back-water planet, Yuri dreamed of being able to travel the stars. After many years he saved up enough credits to buy transport off the planet, but space travel is forbidden to second class citizens, and he is chased by the security forces of the corrupt owner of the planet. To survive the dangers of space Yuri must become a captain, buy and customize star ships, and fight against hostile enemies both on the ground and in space.

The majority of Infinite Space's gameplay involves space ships, both in fighting and in modifying. All ships have a certain amount of space for extra modules to be added, and the abilities and shape of modules must be considered when choosing how to outfit a ship. In ship to ship combat you can control the distance your fleet is from the enemy fleet. During combat a command bar charges. You can use a small amount of the command bar to Dodge, use more to fire a Normal salvo, or expend almost all of it for a Barrage, which fires three times as many shots as Normal. If the opposing fleet uses Dodge before a Barrage then every shot will miss, leaving the attacking fleet at a disadvantage. If a Normal salvo is fired while the opposing fleet is Dodging, then every shot will hit and deal extra damage. Extra combat options come into play with larger star ships equipped with fighter hangars, special weapons, boarding parties, and officers with unique abilities.

The story progresses primarily with text dialogue and the occasional FMV. Sometimes the player is prompted to make a decision in dialogue for Yuri, and these decisions can have far reaching consequences. Additional officers can join Yuri through the story, by hiring them at a mercenary office, or by finding them on various planets. All officers have unique stats and abilities that make them better for a particular role, such as doctor, engineer, or pilot, than others, and these stats and abilities increase in level from combat.</desc>

The player takes control of two insects by the name of Detective Chrys Liszt and partner Roachy Caruthers as they investigate a murder at the Nectarola Soft Drink Company.

There are many elements to the game, having the player interrogate suspects using good cop/bad cop techniques and interview witnesses in a story-based style. Players can also explore environments for clues, track suspect bugs and attack enemies with gameplay for this utilizing the stylus for aiming and the D-pad to move the main character and the L&amp;R shoulder buttons to fire the weapon of choice.</desc>

	<desc>Mostly based on the 2008 movie Iron Man, this videogame of the one-man-army hero has been released for seven different platforms. The NDS version, by A2M, is the most different one.

The game of Iron Man puts you under the skin of Tony Stark. He is a billionaire weapon-industrialist and genius inventor who, after being kidnapped by terrorists who want to force him to build weapons for them, builds an armor instead to escape. Since then, he decided to stop producing weapons and keeps on working on the suit to fight them back.

The games take the story further, giving the player the chance to go through 8 different missions, divided in by air and by foot missions, and even fight villains that do not appear on the movie, like Whiplash and Titanium Man. All this is shown through images between every mission, which use the voices of the actors of the movie like Robert Downey Jr. and Terrence Howard.

As for the game mechanics, by foot or by air, with the first armor at the beginning and in the characteristic red and gold suit later, using range weapons or melee attacks, the game features Stark fighting with armies of soldiers, tanks, helicopters, canons, etc. with the help of an array of upgradeable weapons like missiles, micro-grenades, repulsive shots, EMP blasts, a flame thrower and the powerful "Unibeam". Both the weapons and the suit (propulsion and armor systems) are upgradeable using the points that each mission regards you.

In the handling section, the next approach is used: move with a given set of controls, aim with another. In addition, there is also a button for repulsors (extra propulsion) to fly faster. The NDS touchscreen is used for aiming 360-wise, touching in a given direction from the center of the screen, and the pad is used for moving.</desc>

	<path>./Jenga - World Tour (USA).nds</path>
	<desc>Jenga World Tour is a take off of the popular board game in which you take blocks from the lower part of a block tower and set it on top without toppling it.  The premise is the same for the video game, using the Wii remote, you pull the blocks while moving the remote and using "A" button while using the "B" button to tap them out gently to keep the stack from toppling over.

There are several different backgrounds (in the pit of a volcano, medieval England, underwater, prehistoric times or even the Himalayan Mountain) you can play in, each having their own special differences, such as blocks freezing in the Himalayan stage or only being able to hold onto hot blocks in the volcano for a limited time or even avoiding catapults in the England stage.

There is also an arcade mode where you play a continuous game of Jenga or you can play against a friend in multi-player mode. The Nintendo DS runs along similar lines, using the stylus pen to pull out and tap blocks out of place, but doesn't have the same levels as the Wii version, but does have the same kind of effects (i.e. ice blocks, cement blocks and even UFO attacks). You can also play against a friend using Wi-Fi.</desc>

	<path>./Jewel Match (USA) (En,Fr).nds</path>
	<desc>This is the Nintendo DS release of the well-received match-3 game Jewel Match for Windows/Macintosh. Due to the limited screen size of the handheld, the grid size of the levels had to be cut down from 14x14 to 12x12 tiles, thus forcing a complete redesign of all the levels. While at it the developers added some DS-only gameplay options like the new magical storm where the player can blow into the microphone to reshuffle the jewels. 

The basic idea of Jewel Match comes from Bejeweled / Diamond Mine - the player is presented with a grid of jewels. By swapping pairs of tiles which are next to each other, rows of three or more identical jewels can be formed that will disappear instantly, giving points to the player and making room for other gems falling from above to take their place. The levels have gaps and shaped areas, though, so pieces do not simply fall vertically but also can fall diagonally.

Jewel Match has its own victory criterion though. On each of the 150 levels, a selection of squares have gold or even silver backings. One match (gold) or two (silver) must be created over each of these against a ticking clock to clear the level. Later in the game there are jewels tied to their square with a golden or silver chain, which thus are not falling down and blocking empty squares beneath them. These jewels can be freed by matching them once or twice, too, which means that the most difficult squares must be matched four times (silver chain and silver background) to be cleared.

A succession of hammers are unlocked once you have scored a certain amount of points. The first removes a particular jewel, the second not only removes the gem but also any effects (background or chains) on the square, and the final one removes all gems of that colour. Another extra to be unlocked is a magical storm that will have the player blow into the DS microphone to mix up the jewels. Moreover, matching more than three jewels in a row will create gems with special powers. Matching four will create a joker gem while matching five gives a gem that, once activated, will destroy the whole row it is in. 

The game also offers a hot seat mode where two players can play the same level right after another, competing for the better clearing time.</desc>

It takes a different approach to the formula, by delivering information in smaller sessions, making it easier to take in. Gameplay is designed to suit a childs attention span and ensures they are frequently occupied.

Unlockable games include:

1. Ghosts - use the stylus to touch a ghost and capture it. As many as possible must be caught within the time limit.

2. Twins - a memory game requiring pairs of people to be matched up against a time limit.

3. Snakes - a game of skill and timing that requires a snake to be guided around the screen to collect coloured sweets.

4. Football  the stylus is used to move a football boot across the screen kicking a ball against the wall to remove bricks.

5. Beggar My Neighbour  tap on a pile of playing cards with the stylus to play a move against the console. Whoever has the highest card wins the hand.

6. Balloon Pop - the D-pad is used to move a sling shot to the left and right. The A button fires at the balloons and pops them.</desc>

	<desc>The DS version on Justice League Heroes, while not following the plot of its console brethren, has a similar premise where you play as a member of the titular super-hero team and travel to a number of locations where hordes of enemies run amok.

The game is played with a top-down view of the environment on the lower screen and a map on top. The map displays the location of your next checkpoint and the positions of the enemies along with the status of your characters. The lower screen, in addition to the action, has various function icons that can be activated with the stylus.

There are about a dozen missions broken into about forty sections. Before each, you must pick two heroes from the line-up of Superman, Batman, Wonder Woman and Flash. Each has regular melee attacks, strong melee attacks, a ranged attack and a unique super-power move. They must use these abilities to defeat many enemies and move to the next checkpoint, completing objectives such as switch-flipping and item collection along the way. You may swap between your two heroes at any time by tapping an icon on the screen. Another icon lets you call in an AI-controlled hero for brief support. There are six of these to choose from: Martian Manhunter, Zatanna, Green Lantern, Aquaman, Green Arrow and Huntress. Each of these has a unique ability based on their powers.

In addition to the main game, there are two minigames and a third can be unlocked by inserting Justice League Heroes: The Flash into the GBA slot.</desc>

The touch screen displays the melody at the top that you must follow, and the three bars below represent the different note 'types' that you can play - either by tapping, or by sliding the stylus along the note (depending on the difficulty level). Based on the accuracy of the note press, you'll be awarded "GOOD", "KIRA²" "RAINBOW", or "MISS" if you fail to hit it.

A story mode is included, where the player progresses by completing songs and unlocking new ones for play. They also earn money, which can be used to purchase clothes and accessories for their in-game avatar to wear. There are also photo booths where the avatar can pose in a variety of ways for the camera.</desc>

Kirby Super Star Ultra is an updated remake of Kirby Super Star, a popular SNES game which is broken up into seven main games. In addition to those previous games, Ultra includes five new games and three new sub-games. Listed are just some of the new ones:

Revenge of the King: King Dedede wants a rematch! This game is a toughened up version of Spring Breeze, the opening game.

The Arena: Every boss that Kirby has met throughout the game, one after the other! Try to beat them all!

Meta Knightmare Ultra: Play through the first five games as Meta Knight, with his own special abilities and powers! Speed is the key!

Kirby Card Swipe: Watch the top screen, and quickly pick the correct card. Be the first to do it thrice!

Kirby on the Draw: Enemy targets pop up, tap them as they appear. Don't tap the bombs!

Snack Tracks: Eat all the food on your tracks. Don't eat the bugs, bombs or rocks!

As with the original, Ultra features a heavily featured multiplayer mode. All games can be played either co-operatively or competitively. Spring Breeze can even be played co-operatively if your friend doesn't have a copy of the game!</desc>

	<desc>A great war once raged across the land with many a valiant knight falling on the field of battle. In the end, the evil forces have prevailed, and have since taken over and corrupted the once great kingdom. On a stormy night a Wisp is awakened by a strange armored maiden. The wisp holds the memories of the war, and is now seeking all the valiant dead to be brought back to the world of the living in order to complete their mission and take back the land that was once theirs.

Knights in the Nightmare can be loosely summed up as a Strategy RPG, but it is played like no other Strategy RPG in existence. The game is almost entirely stylus controlled on Nintendo DS, and combines the active-timer turn-based combat of a game such as Final Fantasy VI with elements of bullet-hell top-down shooters, and relies on a set of unorthodox rules for completion of its goals.

Once in the field of battle the player controls the Wisp who can cause the spirits of fallen heroes inhabiting the area to temporarily reconstitute into their physical form and do battle with monsters that now roam the land. The player can recruit those warriors permanently into their party by seeking out objects that meant something to them while they were alive.

The game features a robust character customization system that includes many classes of units, multiple jobs per each unit class, and a soul transplant system that allows the player to transfer all attributes of one player into another.</desc>

	<desc>Konductra is a touch-based game where players can challenge one another via the Nintendo Wi-Fi Connection and battle head-to-head by matching colorful tiles and attempting to block the opponents progress. Players can square off against the computer, complete challenging tasks, or rack up high scores to practice for matches against the greatest puzzle masters online.

Konductra challenges players to create and destroy lines with colored tiles to either earn points or attack an opponent. Four game modes are offered, including Task, Score, VS. CPU, and VS. Human. In both versus modes, the objective is to beat the opponent by filling up the rivals board as quickly as possible by destroying lines on the players own board and sending them to the opponents board. Gamers destroy lines by matching tiles and using the stylus to trace from like colored conductors running along the four edges of the screen.</desc>

	<path>./Kung Fu Panda (USA).nds</path>
	<desc>In this game based on the 2008 DreamWorks movie of the same name, the player is Po the panda. Po finds out that the best kung fu masters have been captured by the evil Tai Lung. Po is fat, loves to eat dumplings, and is pretty slow and clumsy at kung fu, so he is shocked when he is asked to go rescue them. Although some elements have been changed, the game's theme is largely identical to the movie and linear in design.

Po's journey consists of finding the five kung fu masters, mastering a new skill that they teach him, then continuing on to find Tai Lung. This game is a 3rd-person side-scroller with frequent use of the touch screen and seems largely based on the mechanics and engine employed in the DS version of Spider-Man 3.

Po's movements are controlled through the D-pad while attacks are performed by swiping the styles on the touch screen. These are also used to throw objects and perform the learned special moves. Most of the gameplay consists of hand to hand combat with enemies, and traversing levels by consulting your top screen mini-map. New moves are learned gradually and there are also small puzzle elements where Po needs to interact with the environment to progress.</desc>

	<desc>Labyrinth is the sequel to a SNES game called On the Ball.  The object of the game is to manipulate a ball through a maze to the checkered goal line.    To do this, players must rotate the level around to navigate their way through obstacles.  The ball is constantly falling towards the bottom of the screen, ignoring whatever direction the maze is facing.

There are two ways to control the ball. The first is by using the L and R Shoulder buttons to rotate the maze left or right. The other method is to rotate the maze map on the touch screen using the stylus. Players can also briefly surround their ball with lightning which will shatter certain blocks. It's also possible to customize your ball - you can increase or decrease the weight of your ball, as well as change the colour and material it is made from.

In addition to the single player mode, Labyrinth also features a Single-Cart Multiplayer mode. In this mode, up to four players can take part in making their way through the maze. The first player to reach the goal is the winner.</desc>

You play as Keith and Skye, two teenagers who wake up on an abandoned island following an ocean disaster. The two must learn to make fire and provisions, gather food, and look for a way to get back home.

Mini-games include making fire, digging for shells, trapping, bow hunting, fishing, and cooking. All must be done with a sense of urgency, as your characters' fatigue slowly builds throughout the day as they continually approach starvation.

The game is the spiritual sequel to Survival Kids.</desc>

	<desc>Lost in Blue 3 is a continuation of the Lost in Blue series where once again the player must survive and escape a deserted island while trying to survive adverse weather conditions and hunt and forage for food.  This version features four playable characters (two at the start and two more when the game is beaten), each with their own strengths and weaknesses as well as different storylines for each.

The game is told through a series of flashbacks that will give the players clues on how to escape. Players must survive various natural disasters like freak lightning storms and earthquakes that can drain their characters health and stamina. Players can also explore the island and play in one of 20 different minigames such as river rafting and playing with dolphins. Players can explore various different environments on the island from the beach to the jungle interior.

There is also online capabilities through either single card play in a series of mini-games or use multi-card play to play a cooking minigame head to head.</desc>

Lost Magic is a game that where the primary focus is combat, with little in the way of exploration to interrupt the main theme of the game. The stylus is used to direct the player's allies, (monsters captured by Isaac)and to cast spells.

The focus of the game is capturing monsters to later help the Isaac defeat the more powerful foes. Up to 400 different spells can be cast, many in combination with others to create new effects. The challenge lies in using the stylus quickly and accurately to not only combine these spells, but to effectively direct the real time battles.

The game supports Wi-Fi as well as both single and multi cartridge versions of multiplayer.</desc>

	<desc>Luminous Arc is a strategy role-playing game. 

The story is set in a world in which there are two groups in apparent opposition: the Luminous church, and the witches. 

During the course of the story, the player controls a party made up of orphans who have been raised by the Luminous church. They are called the Garden Children, and are tasked with the condemnation of witches. However, soon after the beginning of the story, it becomes evident that things are not as clear-cut as they initially seem.

Structurally, the party moves from area to area, and the plot advances as the player progresses through battles. Equipment may be powered up through the use of a vitae forging system. Also, relationships with characters may be strengthened during post-fight "intermissions," leading to some bonuses in future battles.</desc>

	<desc>Many years into the future, a race of vampires have emerged, plunging planet Earth into darkness with an environmental control system called the 'paraSOL'.  They now control the planet, with humans living in fear.  When all hope seems lost, two boys with amazing power emerge to save the planet.  The Dark Swordsman, Lucian, and a rookie member of the vampire fighting 'Guild', Aaron.

Lunar Knights is an indirect sequel to the Boktai series of games, which takes place many years after. Its focus is much more on action as opposed to stealth, although some stealth elements from the earlier games remain (for example, you can blow into the microphone to whistle and attract the attention of enemies). Players control the two characters, Lucian and Aaron. Lucian fights with a huge sword called 'Vanagand'. As a result, Lucian has a close combat style. Lucian uses the power of moonlight to fuel his special attacks and moves.

The other character is Aaron, a gunslinger for the Guild. He fights by using sunlight to charge up his gun, the Knight, and shoot ranged shots at foes. Aaron's special attacks and moves use up sunlight. Both Aaron and Lucian can use junk materials to increase the level of their weaponry, giving them more power.

The main goal of the game is to make your way through the dungeons and purify the vampire at the end. The dungeons themselves are fairly standard - you search for treasure chests, avoid traps and solve puzzles. At the end, you'll fight a boss vampire, and once you've defeated them, the Casket Rocket will be called. Because the vampires have blocked out the sun on Earth, you'll need to take the vampire into space to purify them.

At this point, the game becomes a touch screen controlled shooter. To control the ship itself, you drag it around the screen with the stylus. To shoot enemy ships, you tap them with the screen. Once you reach the end, the vampire will be purified by the magnified power of the sun.</desc>

	<desc>Madagascar Kartz is a racing game based on DreamWorks Animation's Madagascar. It was released on October 27, 2009 and the second game on Madagascar's spin-off series.

Gameplay[edit]
The game is a basic kart racing game, and the player can perform jumps, flips, rolls.[1] There are many different stages from scenes of the franchise.[1] Playable characters include Alex, Marty, Gloria, Melman, King Julien, Mason and Phil, or all four of the penguins.[1] The Madagascar Kartz Wheel is bundled with the Wii version of the game. This wheel is optional. This wheel's look is different from that of the Wii Wheel from Mario Kart Wii.[1]

Playable characters include Alex the Lion, Marty the Zebra, Melman the Giraffe, Gloria the Hippotamus, The Penguins, The Chimps, and King Julien from the Madagascar. Two characters from other movies are included alongside the Madagascar, Shrek from Shrek, and B.O.B. from Monsters vs. Aliens, all DreamWorks Animation franchises. Race types include Quick Race, Championship, Time Trial and Checkpoint race. A Championship race is one where the player collects mangoes and tries to finish first place in order to unlock higher speed classes (50cc, 100cc, 150cc, 200cc, the last one is raced in reverse direction/mirror mode), more karts and tracks. In Time Trial, players beat their own times and earn medals (gold, silver and bronze). In Checkpoint Race, players collect as many hourglasses as they can before the time runs out. There are several tracks in the game. Also, in a track, most tracks have 2 shortcuts. "I Like to Move It", sung by Reel 2 Real, is the menu theme. The game's gameplay is similar to those of Mario Kart Wii, by Nintendo. The sequel is Super Star Kartz.</desc>

	<desc>Magical Starsign is Role Playing Game about a group of students at the Will O Wisp magical academy. When their teacher mysteriously disappears they set out to find and rescue her. As she is on a different planet, this involves space travel. The player starts out alone, but one by one the classmates join the quest.

The students are each specialized in a different art of magic, linked to a starsign. As the planets move through the sky (as seen on the 'astrolog') the magic associated with that sign grows stronger and weaker. This applies to the monsters as well, which adds a strategic element to the gameplay. 

As characters grow stronger, they learn new spells. During combat, players tap on the attacks they want to use and then tap on an enemy to target. By tapping the character's head at the exact moment they release the spell, the attack is extra effective. 

There are two multiplayer options. The first, tag mode, allows players to exchange data with one another. In the magical rocket, an egg will hatch that will slowly develop into a new unique character. In the amigo dungeon mode up to six people can explore an 'amigo dungeon'.</desc>

Marbles will relentlessly roll across twisted tracks and into a hole in its center. When three same-coloured marbles touch each other, they destroy themselves. With the DS Stylus, players must shoot same-coloured marbles into the oncoming rows in order to prevent them from falling down the hole and thus clear a track. The twist is that now, marbles that share the same color will attract each other!

Magnetica takes advantage of the Nintendo DS hardware for precise touch-screen functionality and brings a new play mechanic to the famous puzzle. Test your ball-shooting skills in Challenge Mode, Puzzle Mode, Quest Mode and more.</desc>

There are different themes of blocks to choose from, including classic Chinese characters but also more general symbol.

	<desc>Based on the documentary March of the Penguins, this game follows the story of the emperor penguins as they embark on a long journey to breed their young. The game has been divided into twelve chapters, with different gameplay. The penguins need to be navigated through the environment, find a suitable mate, find food, take care of the egg, guard the young ones and finally make it all the way back.

A large part of the game is based on the concept of Lemmings. As the penguins march on, players need to help them land softly, melt obstacles, attract them in a certain direction using fish and place trampolines, ramps, slides, bridges and steps to make them access new areas. The levels can be explored using binoculars and the penguins need to collect a certain amount of snowflakes to pass. The penguins cannot die. When they fall off a cliff, they simply restart at the beginning of the level, but the players needs to bring them to the end as a group to succeed.

Other levels have the penguins slide down hills with faster gameplay, feature mazes, or take place underwater where predators need to be avoided while collecting food. In the later parts of the game, guarding the eggs adds an new layer of difficulty. As soon as a penguin hits an obstacle it is dropped. There is little time to pick it up again or it freezes. It also need to be taken to a warm spot before the thermometer time runs out.

Some educational content has also been included. Next to the habits, more information about the penguin migration in provided in between levels.</desc>

	<desc>Square and Nintendo reunite for a unique take on the basketball genre in Mario Hoops 3 on 3. Mario Hoops uses almost exclusively the DS stylus to play both offense and defense. Despite having all the moves you would expect from a basketball game the rules are quite different. Instead of 2-3 pointers. You collect coins along the ground which affect your score if you make a basket. Games can get on average up to 300 points.

On the offensive side you can tap the screen to dribble the ball, swipe in your teammates direction to pass, stroke up to dunk, and show your impressive ball handling skills by dribbling the ball in full 360 degrees around your character.

On the defensive side you can do everything from jumping, to stealing, to blocking. The game even allows for goal tending. This isn't your fathers basketball game.

Included in the game is the ability to rise through the ranks in tournament mode, play against your friends in multiplayer one on one, and hone your skills in challenge mode. With over 15 courts, unlockable balls, and more than 18 of the most popular Mario and Square characters.

Playing tournament mode pits you and your team of 3 players up against 3 teams in a battle for the typical Mario style cups. While doing so new characters, courts, and balls will be unlocked all of which you can use in singleplayer or multiplayer.

There are two multiplayer modes. One of which is a race to see who can get 100 points by dribbling. This game is 4 player and supports DS download play. The main multiplayer mode is a 1 on 1 battle. Each player has 3 teammates and battles in two periods to see who can get the most coins.</desc>
	<path>./Mario Kart DS (USA) (En,Fr,De,Es,It).nds</path>
	<desc>Mario Kart DS is the continuation of the long running racing game series that began on the Super Nintendo. It features 16 new tracks as well as 16 tracks from the previous 4 games, with each set split up into the Nitro and Retro Grand Prix respectively. Eight racers are initially available, each with two go-karts to choose from. A number of characters and additional karts are also available to unlock. New items have been added to the arsenal, including a Blooper squid that squirts ink onto the screens of other players and a Bullet Bill power up that transforms the player into a giant, fast-travelling bullet on autopilot.

One of the features of this version is its support for online Internet play through Nintendo's WiFi service. MKDS owners can challenge up to 3 other people in Grand Prix mode on 20 of the 32 tracks. Players can also match up with friends by trading "Friend Codes" that are generated based on the DS that is used and the copy of the game owned. Custom emblems to use on karts are supported through the game's paint program.

Battle mode is also present with 8-player support and 6 tracks. This time, there are two modes to choose from: "Balloon Battle" and "Shine Runners." Balloon Battle is similar to the previous versions of this mode, with the exception that every player starts with only one balloon, and 5 in reserve. Players can have 2 additional balloons by either holding the Select button while standing still to inflate them, or by blowing into the DS's microphone. "Shine Runners" tasks players to collect "Shines," with the winner being the one that has the most.

New to the series is "Mission Mode," which consists of a series of single player objective-based missions. Each mission takes place on a section of a race track and tasks the player to accomplish goals not normally seen in the other game modes. Such tasks include picking up coins on the track, using items to take out enemies, and racing through numbered gates. Missions are split up into 6 sets of 8, with a 9th mission for each where players must battle against a boss character. 

Local wireless multiplayer is supported for up to 8 people in Grand Prix, VS, and Battle Modes.

	<path>./Mario Party DS (USA).nds</path>
	<desc>Mario Party DS continues the Mario Party gameplay on the Nintendo DS. It is a multiplayer game played as a board game. Each player can choose between well known characters from the Mario universe such as Mario, Luigi, Princess Peach, Yoshi, Princess Daisy, Toad, Wario and Waluigi. Players play mini-games to earn stars. At the end of the game the player with most stars wins the game.

It is possible to play the game with four players in multiplayer. With download-play only one cartridge is required. Each round the players roll dice to advance on the board. Somewhere on the board a star is located, which can be collected by the first player to reach that spot. After each round the players play a mini-game, this can be free for all, 1 vs. 3 or 2 vs. 2. The game includes 74 different mini-games and some of them use the stylus or microphone.

At the end of each game more stars are rewarded for the player who for example won most mini-games.</desc>

	<desc>Marvel Trading Card Game is a strict electronic conversion of the Vs. System collectible card game rules by Upper Deck. It includes cards from all of the Marvel-based Vs. sets through the X-Men set.

The gameplay involves head-to-head battles where players recruit superhero characters with various strengths and powers onto the playfield. Each character has a basic Attack and Defense value which determines the outcome of individual character battles. This basic mechanic is augmented by character powers, Equipment cards (which give the character additional powers/stats), Location cards (which affect multiple cards or game rules while they are face up), and Plot Twist cards (which are often played to change the outcome of individual character battles by boosting Attack or Defense values).

The game features two single player campaigns, tutorials, puzzles, and an online mode similar to Magic The Gathering Online. The online mode supports cross-platform play between the PC and PSP versions.</desc>

	<desc/>
	<path>./Master of Illusion (USA).nds</path>
	<desc>Master of Illusion is different from other exercise games. This one is a take on magic, teaching the player but also performing magic tricks against the player itself. There are three different modes including Solo Magic, Magic Show and Magic Training.

In Solo Magic, a magician performs parlor tricks such as guessing what card the player has just picked out or guessing by the hand gestures the player makes over the DS screen.

In Magic Tricks, there are fourteen different tricks to try where the game is more of an assistant, helping the player out performing your tricks including having a friend pick out a card and drawing a face at the bottom of the screen that will guess the card picked out. It can also guess a person's birthday or where they are going on their vacation. Some of the tricks have the player recite different things through the microphone, for instance the vacation trick, or the player needs to blow into the microphone.

The third mode is called Magic Training, which is more of a series of mini-games to help test reaction speed. There are step by step instructions of how to perform tricks and there is also a special deck of cards that comes with the game.</desc>
	<path>./Master of the Monster Lair (USA).nds</path>
	<desc>Master of the Monster Lair is a dungeon crawling RPG with a different twist, whereas in previous dungeon crawlers the objective is to find the dungeons and monsters to clear them, the player creates the dungeon (or a monster lair in this case) in order to attract the monster and trap it to destroy it.  There are 23 different rooms to customize for the player's Monster Lair.

The story takes place in a small town called South Arc where the nearby forests are harboring monsters who regularly invade the town and scare of the citizens. This is where the player takes control of an orphan called Owen who is searching for his first job where he encounters a magical talking shovel. After realizing his destiny, he decides to start digging a lair and destroy the monster infestation.

The view of the game uses the DS dual-screen technology, showing the world in the top screen while the bottom screen will show maps and item menus. The gameplay is the standard turn-based RPG battle, selecting options from a menu such as attack and casting spells as well as the option to turn and run from the battle.

Players can pick up items and currency from monsters that are defeated in battle and use them to buy new weapons and armor for future battles or even furniture for Owen's house. There is also wireless capabilities where players can view and exchange dungeons through Wi-Fi.</desc>

Mega Man Zero 3
Mega Man Zero 4

In addition to the four games, Mega Man Zero Collection also features an art gallery with works from the games in the series. The e-Reader cards that were exclusive to the Japanese version of Mega Man Zero 3 and provided in-game enhancements are now discoverable throughout that game as collectibles. There is also the option to play through all four games in one continuous playthrough, rather than having to select each game individually. Finally, an included "Easy Mode" makes the game more accessible to those not used to the game's tough difficulty level.</desc>
	<path>./Mega Man ZX - Advent (USA).nds</path>
	<desc>Grey was a Reploid found in a hidden factory in suspended animation, accidentally awakened during battle.  Ashe was a human Hunter, chasing after treasures and bounties.  After their encounter with the evil Prometheus, they were rescued and taken to a Hunter Base, where their first mission was to help transport a mysterious Biometal.  With another attack on the train occurring during their mission, they attempt to protect it - the Biometal, Model A, fuses with them, allowing them to become a powerful Mega Man!  But other people are after Model A as well...

Mega Man ZX Advent is the sequel to Mega Man ZX. Players can choose to play as either Grey or Ashe, each with their own storyline and slightly different weaponry, but the overall game remains the same. The game itself plays much like the side-scrolling platformer Mega Man X. However, once the main character fuses with the Biometal, they can transform into Model A, which allows them to steal the data of bosses, taking on their appearance as well as their abilities.</desc>
	<path>./Mega Man ZX (USA).nds</path>
	<desc>Many years after the events in the Mega Man Zero series, humans and Reploids (humanoid robots) have at last found peace.  Two humans, Vent and Aile, work for a delivery company called Giro Express.  After being ambushed during a delivery, they come in contact with something called 'biometal', which transforms them into the Maverick Hunter, X.  Using their new powers, they decide to work for a group called "The Guardians", who protect civilians from Maverick attacks.

Mega Man ZX is a side scrolling platformer for the Nintendo DS. While the gameplay is similar to the Mega Man X series, in that you find powerups to increase your health meter, gain subtanks to store surplus energy when needed, and gain new abilities such as swimming and flight through acquiring boss powers, the art style is more similar to the Mega Man Zero series of games.

As players progress through the game, they gain the power of different types of "biometal", which gives them robotic weaponry and abilities. Different situations require different biometal suits, and sometimes (such as in civilian areas), it's best to return to your human form so that you can make your way through areas without being hassled. New models of biometal can be acquired from boss enemies. While you can hit their weak spots for more damage, it's actually beneficial not to, as the more damage you do to the weak spot results in more repairs that you need to make to the biometal later.</desc>

	<path>./Metal Slug 7 (USA).nds</path>
	<desc>Metal Slug 7 is the eighth entry in the Metal Slug saga and an exclusive to Nintendo's DS handheld system. The player chooses from six different heroes (Marco, Eri, Tarma, Fio, Ralf and Clark) as the embark on a mission to stop the diabolical (and persistent) General Morden as he unleashes hordes of henchman and machinery to stop the player, as well as make allies with a new and more dangerous army in the process.

Like many others in the series, the gameplay is basically the same, having the player using the D-pad to move their character around on the screen and using the "Y" button to fire their primary weapon. The "A" button is used for throwing grenades and the basic melee attack as the player comes in close quarters with an enemy with the "R" button to change their primary weapons.

There are some new melee attacks as well when using the D-Pad and pressing the "Y" button to unleash the attack, each attack differ depending upon the character selected. Also, four characters (Marco, Tarma, Ralf &amp; Clark) have a special attack that can be used by pressing "Up" on the D-Pad and hitting the "L" button and the "Y" button. Along with these new attacks, the game also utilizes the DS' dual screen capabilities with the main game being played on the top screen and a scrollable map on the bottom screen that show's locations of freed POW's and items picked up as well.

The standard power-ups are also present such as heavy machine gun, rocket launcher and laser gun to name a few as well as the ever dangerous "Metal Slugs" that are scattered throughout the seven stages of the game, ranging from the standard tanks to jet fighters and even bi-pedal tanks. There are also three difficulty settings to choose from: Beginner, Normal and Hard.

A new feature is the 80 mission Combat School option which allows players to partake in a series of special missions that will award players depending upon the required action of the stage (ex. some stages will score the player on how many soldiers they destroy while other's will score the player depending on how many POW's they rescue). The better the player does during these missions, the more points they will be awarded and raise their ranking which ranges from "Recruit" to "General of the Army".</desc>

	<path>./Meteos (USA).nds</path>
	<desc>Designed by Masahiro Sakurai and produced by Tetsuya Mizuguchi, Meteos was the DS's second big-name puzzle game (after Polarium).  

Most of the game's action takes place on the bottom of the DS's two screens, where colored meteors plummet downwards towards a planet's atmosphere. There, they form columns that the user can manipulate with either the stylus or a combination of the D-pad and A button. When three or more meteors of the same color are arranged either vertically or horizontally, they "ignite" and rocket up towards the top screen. Rockets carry upwards any other metors that happen to be above them, and by stringing together several ignitions it is possible to lift many blocks at once. The ultimate objective of the game is to lift as many metors as possible back into "orbit" in the top screen; the game is over if the bottom screen fills up completely with meteors. Meteos features many different "planets" that the user can play on, each with subtle variations (such as in gravity) that affect gameplay.</desc>

	<desc>In this pinball game based on Metroid Prime, Samus gets knocked and rolled around the table in Morph Ball form; the table contains Metroids, which can latch onto her and suck away health. Tables include the surface of Tallon IV, the Space Station, the Phazon Mines, and more can be unlocked by searching for artifacts and collecting bounties, which are found by destroying Space Pirates and other dangerous creatures.

Metroid Prime Pinball is a pinball game with a Metroid theme. Players can collect power-ups such as missiles and super bombs, which can be helpful when defeating bosses. There are also missions to be completed within a time limit; these missions can involve defeating unique enemies that appear on the table or completing tasks such as wall jumping. Completing missions earns either artifacts or special tokens.

The game also features a single-card multiplayer mode. In this mode, up to eight players can play. The game is a race to see who can reach a certain score first. Players lose points if they lose their ball. It is also possible to dump enemies onto opponents' tables to cause trouble for them.</desc>

The monsters who feature in all of the fairy tale stories don't like this at all, so they take it upon themselves to rescue their world.

Monster Puzzle is a puzzle game similar to Zoo Keeper or Bejeweled. You have a set grid of monsters that can be dragged with the stylus either left and right or up and down (up to a maximum of three spaces). If you match at least three monsters horizontally or vertically, that row of monsters will disappear. If you match up a 2x2 square of monsters, a 4x4 square of monsters will be deleted.

Unlike Zoo Keeper and Bejeweled, the goal is not to just eliminate monsters. Instead, players must 'claim' spaces where the monsters lie, which is done when you clear a set of monsters. In most stages, you will just need to claim the space once (which turns it orange), but in later stages, you will need to claim space twice (which turns orange spaces to red). After a certain percentage of space is claimed, the player moves onto the next stage.

The game can also be played in versus mode with a friend. In this mode, the player who runs out of time first is the loser. Time can be added by continuing to clear monsters. If you clear multiple monsters simultaneously, a rock will appear on the opponent's screen which makes it more difficult for them to clear monsters.</desc>

After updating the Renegade Engine, used for the first game, Dementium, this new shooter for the DS puts you in the role of Major Edward Kane, Chief of Military Operations for the Extra-Terrestrial Encounter Organization. The year is 2058 and you and your squad are sent to the moon to investigate strange things that have been happening at the new moon bases. An alien hatch has been discovered at the construction site of one of the bases. So you need to take charge and take care of business.

As its predecessor, it tries to fill the lack of shooters for Nintendo's handheld. With the stylus for aiming, the D-pad for moving and the shoulder buttons for shooting, Moon revisits the late 90's style of shooter started by the Quake series.

The game features 24 episodes, 7 different weapons, various levels of difficulty, bonuses and other game modes to unlock.</desc>

	<path>./Myst (USA) (En,Fr) (Rev 1).nds</path>
	<desc>You have just stumbled upon a most intriguing book, a book titled Myst. You have no idea where it came from, who wrote it, or how old it is. Reading through its pages provides you with only a superbly crafted description of an island world. But it's just a book, isn't it? As you reach the end of the book, you lay your hand on a page. Suddenly your own world dissolves into blackness, replaced with the island world the pages described. Now you're here, wherever here is, with no option but to explore.

Myst is a first-person point-and-click adventure where the player controls a character known as The Stranger. Magically transported into the world described in the book, he needs to explore Myst Island and solve its mysteries. The game is presented as a series of static scenes where the player acts with the environment by clicking and manipulating objects. There are no enemies and it is not possible to die. Through Myst Island, the game is further divided into mini-worlds set in different ages accessed through different books.

The PSP version adds new adventure scenarios and includes widescreen support.

The DS version includes a completely new age, the Rime Age, and, next to a code rewrite, includes new and re-mastered sound effects and video clips.</desc>

	<desc>A shooter of the vertical scroller type, Nanostray is similar to past games like Raiden and Tyrian to mention but a few. 

Players unlock features (concept art, backgrounds etc.) by fighting through an adventure mode, which in turn allows finished levels to be played in arcade mode, which is purely for attaining high scores. High scores in arcade mode can be logged on the games official site for ranking against other players around the world.

Adventure mode also allows players to tackle missions in non linear order, however all three in one group must be finished before the next three can be attempted and so on.

The touch screen is used for current status and to scan the end of level bosses for weaknesses.

Challenge modes are added when adventure levels are completed, allowing players to play through the game with a set of restrictions, making high scores more difficult, but increasing the challenge and lastability of the game.

Two players can fight competitively to get the highest score before a timer ends or be the first to reach a certain predefined limit of points.

The game supports single cart play for multiplayer so only one copy is needed.</desc>
	<path>./Nanostray 2 (USA).nds</path>
	<desc>Nanostray 2 is similar in gameplay to the original Nanostray, but has a few new features.  You can play over thirty missions with over six different game modes to play in.  You can play the Adventure Mode, which shows cut-scenes to tie into the story or you can skip the story and play Arcade mode and just go for the highest score possible.

You can also play in challenge mode, completing a set of four challenges that unlocks a new simulator mode challenge, which is similar to Arcade mode, but with a different scoring system. It has sixteen massive bosses and over one hundred different types of enemies and you can change control styles, using the classic or using the left or right handed touch control. There is also a Nanogauge that fills up when you destroy multiple enemies, earning you bonus multipliers.

You can play against a friend in duel mode or play in cooperative mode using multi-cards and can also upload your high scores online using the Wi-Fi connection.</desc>

Taking place in a massive, open city, NFS Underground 2 allows players to explore the city at will, engaging random challengers and moving into the coveted Underground Racing League. Once in the Underground Racing League, the player advances first by race wins, then with building up their tuner car and taking on tougher opponents. The objective is to win all Underground Racing League engagements and trick out your car to the max.

	<desc>At its core Nervous Brickdown is a Arkanoid-clone and the first ten levels feature the familiar gameplay of using a horizontally moving paddle at the bottom and a ball to destroy bricks at the top of the screen. But each of the ten worlds (divided into 9 levels and one boss fight) feature a different type of gameplay.

In the second stage the player needs to draw the paddle on the screen himself to knock the ball against ink blots. Depending on the form of the drawn paddle, the ball will bounce off differently. And to spice things up even more, the paddle isn't restricted to just horizontal movement anymore but can instead be freely moved around at the bottom of the screen. Other stages require the player to move through a haunted house and kill ghosts by blowing into the microphone or contain a laser beam which increases it's speed. 

By playing successfully through the levels, the player unlocks bonuses which range from extra lives to the ability to change the trajectory of the ball by blowing into the microphone.

The game also features a multiplayer mode for two players in which the ball changes into the player's paddle color so it will only bounce off the paddle with the corresponding color.</desc>

	<desc>Onpu Island is an island populated by musical spirits called Ontama. These strange, multicolored creatures can allow skilled performers, called 'Ontamaestros', to perform music by gathering Ontama. Beat and Rest, two young friends from a small village on the island, find an Ontama on the street. They discover that the Ontama are being captured, and so they set out to find out what's happening to them, and to become Ontamaestros themselves.

Ontamarama is an action rhythm game that makes full use of the DS' capabilities. Ontama appear on the screen, and can be tapped, tossed, and circled. Clearing an Ontama makes fills a note on the bar along the top of the screen, and when the note reaches the end of the bar, the correct button must be pressed to play the note. There are four different colored Ontama, and you also need to watch out for the white and black ones which can help or hinder you in other ways!

The game includes a story mode, a tutorial mode, a free play mode where you can play songs cleared in the story mode, and a challenge mode. There is also a shop where you can buy songs and items with points acquired during the game.</desc>

	<desc>Open Season is based on the Sony Pictures Animation's CG animated film of the same name, where a rowdy brood of forest animals turn the tables on a bunch of unsuspecting hunters.  

The game is a side-scrolling-puzzle adventure. The plot of the game is to complete puzzles and avoid traps to advance from level to level. Every level completed will raise your friendship with the different animals of the forest. Once friends, these animals can be used as allies to attack and defeat the hunters encountered along the way.

Following the plot of the movie, once the player has become friends with a sufficient amount of animals, he can then take on the evil hunter leader Shaw.

The gameplay loop is to find clever ways to solve puzzles that prevent you from moving forward in a level. To solve these puzzles, the player can switch between the two main characters : Boog, a 900 pound bear and Elliott, a crazy deer. Both characters have their specific skills which need to be wisely used to progress through the levels. To solve most of the puzzles, Boog and Elliott, each controlled individually and seperately, will have to work as a team.

To complicate the gameplay a bit, the player will encounter hunters on the way which he can defeat "using" the now friendly skunks, beavers, squirrels... which all have their unique skills.

This game is a 2,5D side-scrolling game with an emphasis on spatial puzzles. The story mode contains 27 levels. In addition, there's also eight minigames.</desc>

	<path>./Over the Hedge (USA).nds</path>
	<desc>A portable adventure game based on the animated movie of the same name and which chronicled the adventures of a group of animals in their struggle against a recently-built housing development.

Playing as either RJ, Hammy or Verne you'll have to complete several incursions into the human dwellings to steal food, supplies and sabotage further housing developments.

Gameplay-wise the game is a 3rd-person perspective stealth-adventure hybrid in which you must navigate through several houses looking to retrieve your current objective while avoiding the many traps set by the homeowners (as well as the homeowners themselves). To get by you can make use of several unique items that allow you to set up diversions, or create them yourself by blowing into the microphone. Each character has individual strengths and weaknesses and in many missions you'll have to alternate between each character to successfully complete the level. 

As a unique feature the game displays the standard 3rd person perspective on the top screen while the lower screen features a top-down view which allows you to better scan the levels for traps and items, both rendered with fully polygonal graphics.

Features a single player campaign and a wireless multiplayer mode with a two-player mode in which two players compete to clear out a level of food.</desc>

Joined by Pac-Mans old enemies, Orson, Clyde and Pinky, and new friends along the way, Pac-Man adventures through different levels from a boneyard of old bots to a burning tower, up mountains, through deserts and the Spectral Realm to destroy all of Erwins Spectral Syphons.

	<path>./Pac-Pix (USA).nds</path>
	<desc>Pac-Pix originally started as a tech-demo for the Nintendo DS when the DS was first announced. Many people at E3 liked the demo so much that Namco made it a full-fledged game. In this DS exclusive title, Pac-Man has been captured by the ghosts and you must save him. You use the touch-screen to draw Pac-Man and try to eat the ghosts.  There are a few different types of ghosts that require a different strategy for each type.

You have Pinky that just moves around slowly and Blue that will make a quick dash as you approach him. There is Numboos which is multiple ghosts with numbers and you must eat them in order if you wish to defeat them. Bari-Boo has a shield and you can only defeat him by attacking from behind, if you hit his shield in front of him or from the side you just bounce off. There's the ink ghosts which throw ink and then there's the block ghosts which require you to break their defenses with a bomb.

During your adventure you will learn to draw arrows to shoot ghosts and stun them, as well as ghosts that are floating in bubbles. You will also be able to draw bombs to destroy blocks that are in your path. There are many things to do with the touch screen in this game. Pac-Pix is a Pac-Man game like no other before it.</desc>

	<desc>Picross 3D is a pseudo-sequel to Picross DS.  As with the original game, your goal is to uncover the hidden image by using the number clues as your guide.  But unlike Picross DS, where the puzzles were flat, in Picross 3D, each puzzle is encased in a cube of a varying size and shape.  By chipping away and rotating the cube, the player can reveal the hidden picture.

Picross 3D has approximately 350 puzzles, across a variety of different themes. Each puzzle is grouped into a particular theme, such as "Beach", "Sports" or "Fire", and when all the puzzles are found for a theme, a medal is added to the theme to indicate that it is complete. Nearly every puzzle has a possibility for a three star rating. To earn all three stars, the player must:

solve the puzzle
complete the puzzle within the time limit
not make any mistakes

As with Picross DS, Picross 3D features a puzzle creator. The user can create their own puzzles, and then, using Nintendo Wi-Fi Connection, send them onto the Internet to trade with friends, as well as receive additional ones.</desc>
	<path>./Picross DS (USA) (En,Fr,Es).nds</path>
	<desc>Picross DS is a touch screen-based puzzle game for the Nintendo DS.  By following the numbers on the left and top of the game grid, players can uncover the picture hidden away.  The rules are simple - if there is one number on a line, say, 10, then you know that there are ten squares in a row that must be chipped away on that line.  If the numbers read something like 2 7, then you must chip away two squares somewhere in the row, separated by at least one empty square, and then seven squares to be chipped away.  By applying these rules horizontally and vertically to the grid, you can work out the picture using logic.

There are two methods of control: you can use the Control Pad to move a cursor, the A Button to chip a square, the B Button to mark it, and the X Button to zoom in or out (similar to Nintendo's previous Picross games). Alternatively, you can use the stylus to play. In this mode, the Control Pad changes the functions of the stylus. When you press Up, you'll chip squares, Down will mark them, Left will zoom in and out, while Right allows you to scroll. The buttons on the right of the DS perform the same functions, which is helpful if you're left-handed.

Picross DS has a variety of different modes:

1. Picross - This is standard Picross. Play through easy, medium and difficult puzzles, or learn how to play. You are penalized with time for any mistakes you make in easy and medium modes. In difficult, your mistakes are not noted at all.

2. Daily Picross - Play a quick set of five Picross puzzles, once a day. Each day, your score is added to a chart, so you can track whether you're improving or getting worse, similar to Brain Age.

3. My Picross - Design your own Picross puzzles by drawing on the grid. When you're done, you can play your puzzles, or send them to others.

4. Competition Picross - Play Picross against others in this mode. You can choose to use single-cart multiplayer, multi-cart multiplayer, or online play via Nintendo Wi-Fi Connection.

You can also download additional puzzle packs for Picross DS by using Nintendo Wi-Fi Connection, including puzzles from Mario's Picross.</desc>

Although only one person needs a Ping Pals cartridge to start the chat, the game uses unlockable clothing and accessories as incentive to purchase their own cartridge and chat away.  Got no friends?  Ping Pals can even simulate chat with a simple AI chatbot.

Players can purchase items from a store using coins or trade for them with other players. Coins are earned in various ways, including receiving a daily allowance, chatting for a long time, typing special predetermined keywords, and playing minigames.</desc>

Alfonso's retired, but he's called in his kids Junior and Fawcett to fix up the island, and maybe learn a few things about plumbing along the way.

Gameplay is similar to the classic Pipe Dream/Pipe Mania, but with a more mission-based structure, and more unusual modes. Missions can be replayed to get a higher grade, and high grades can unlock various treasures, such as movies, character bios, and new game modes. Pipe Mania even has a multiplayer mode; compete against a friend for points, or use your attacks to damage your opponent's pipes.</desc>

	<desc>Take on the world in Planet Puzzle League, a simple but addictive puzzle game that you may recognize as Tetris Attack, Panel De Pon, or Pokémon Puzzle League.  Colored tiles rise up from a bin, and its your job to arrange them horizontally or vertically in lines of three or more of the same tile.  This causes them to disappear.  Advanced players will be able to arrange tiles so that when they land, they clear additional tiles to stop the tiles from rising and score even more points!

Planet Puzzle League features a wide variety of different game modes to keep even the most dedicated puzzler busy:

1. Endless - Play forever until you fail. The tiles rise faster over time.
2. Clear - Remove all the blocks down to the 'CLEAR' line, buried deep down.
3. Garbage Challenge - Garbage blocks rain down on your bin - clear as many as you can!
4. Vs. COM - Play against the CPU. Try to get their tiles to reach the top of the bin first!
5. Time Attack - See how many points you can earn in two minutes.
6. Puzzle - Either clear the preset mind-bending puzzles, or try the various missions that you are given.

Similar to Brain Age, Planet Puzzle League features a 'Daily' Mode. Play these short games once a day to track your skill over a long period of time. Are you getting better? Or worse?

You can also play multiplayer modes of the game, either locally, or over Nintendo Wi-Fi Connection. Modes of play include Birthday Battle (play against people who share your date of birth), Free Play Battle (play an unranked match), and Friend Battle (play against Friends you've traded Friend Codes with).</desc>

	<path>./Platinum Sudoku (USA) (En,Fr,Es).nds</path>
	<desc>Platinum Sudoku offers 20 million Sudoku puzzles (in five levels of difficulty), over 300 Kakuro puzzles and a number of mini-games. The game starts with a tutorial mode and the twenty million puzzles will only be available to you after completing 100 puzzles in Easy, Medium or Hard mode. Solving all puzzles in Hard mode unlocks the Pro mode, solving the Pro puzzles unlocks the Sudoku X mode. New background graphics, fonts, grid styles and music are also unlockable.

The object of Sudoku is to fill a square grid measuring 9x9 spaces, further divided into nine 3x3 squares with the numbers 1 to 9. Each horizontal row and each vertical column can only contain each number once, and this also applies to each of the square grids. Each grid already contains a few numbers, how many depends on the level of difficulty. The game layout can be switched around for left-handed players by choosing an option from the menu.

Filling the grid is done by either drawing the desired character directly onto the grid on the Touch Screen, by pointing to that number on a small grid or by using the D-pad. Several numbers can be entered in one cell in Draft mode. When the player has deduced which number is the only one possible, the choice is made definitive. It is possible to ask for hints, but these cost "coins" that have to be earned by solving puzzles. Hint A gives some possible numbers for the current cell, Hint B provides the correct number for the current cell, and Hint C scans the whole board and marks cells as right or wrong. It is also possible to choose several assisting features from the game menu, for instance highlighting the current row or column, highlighting the "easiest to solve" cells or automatically filling the grid with all possibilities for each cell.

Kakuro puzzles are like crosswords except the grids are filled with numbers. The grid consists of black and white cells. The white cells must be filled with numbers, the black cells contain the clues. Each entry can only contain a number (between 0 and 9) once and the sum of the numbers must match the clue. For example if the clue is "11" and the entry is three cells wide, the solution could be "1, 6, 4" or "2, 5, 4" but not "2, 7, 2". 

The mini-games included in Platinum Sudoku are Subtract (drop numbers unto others to subtract them until you reach zero), Pair Match (draw lines between pairs of numbers), Shuffle (slider puzzle), Choice Block (find the missing number), High Sum (choose the block with the highest sum) and Mine Detector (mine sweeper). If a challenge is met, the game is unlocked in the menu and you can try to improve your high score.

Two players can play co-op to solve a grid together or compete to see who is the fastest in solving a grid. Finally there is a Custom Grid mode which allows you to design your own puzzles.</desc>

	<path>./Polarium (USA).nds</path>
	<desc>This is a puzzle game similar to Tetris in that blocks fall from above, and to clear the lines before the screen fills up, you must create horizontal lines of all the same color (either black or white).  To change the color (or "polarity") of a block, you must select it with the stylus, then tap it again to make the block flip.  You can also drag the stylus along the screen to change the polarity if many block at the same time.

There is also a puzzle mode where time isn't as critical. Blocks aren't falling, but are just in a certain pattern on the screen. The object is to make the polarity of every block in each horizontal line the same. But the trick is to do the entire screen with one swipe of the stylus. There are 100 puzzles in this mode and they can get very difficult.

The most addicting part of this game is the multiplayer. Utilizing the DS's two screens, you can see your blocks and your opponent's blocks. As you create a horizontal line all of the same polarity, that line is then scrambled and sent to your adversary. The object is to clear your screen before your opponent does. The multiplayer mode does not require 2 Game Cards to play. In fact, when the game is sent over to another DS through the IPL, they don't even need to play multiplayer. The person that received the game can play a simple demo of the game by themselves.</desc>
	<path>./Pony Friends (USA) (En,Fr,De,Es,It,Nl) (Rev 1).nds</path>
	<desc>At the beginning of Pony Friends, the player has the choice to buy a pre-defined pony or create his one from scratch by choosing from a variety of different colors and patterns for each of the four parts (body, legs, face and hair).

Once a pony has been created and named, the player has to care for it by feeding or brushing it in order to keep it's values from decreasing. Depending on how good the values and how well the pony has been treated, it will react differently to the players hand (the stylus). A new pony for example will be afraid at first and will run away when the player makes sudden movements.

Besides caring for your pony, outfitting it with accessories or giving it small treats like apples, you can also do racing events, trail riding or let it perform tricks. While the player can't control the horse itself in the racing events, he needs to cheer it on through the microphone to keep it going. But if the player shouts too loud or not loud enough, the pony will slow down.

During trail riding the player can instead pet the pony or order it to gallop through the forest to train it. While the pony rides on the trail, the player can look around and can each day fulfill a quest by photographing specific animals around the trail by touching them with the stylus. There are also hidden gates which open up additional trails if found and touched.

Tricks are performed by the pony if it's out on the field. Depending on it's condition and on how many awards the player has already earned with the pony, the trick will be more difficult.</desc>
	<path>./Pony Friends (USA) (En,Fr,De,Es,It,Nl).nds</path>
	<desc>At the beginning of Pony Friends, the player has the choice to buy a pre-defined pony or create his one from scratch by choosing from a variety of different colors and patterns for each of the four parts (body, legs, face and hair).

Once a pony has been created and named, the player has to care for it by feeding or brushing it in order to keep it's values from decreasing. Depending on how good the values and how well the pony has been treated, it will react differently to the players hand (the stylus). A new pony for example will be afraid at first and will run away when the player makes sudden movements.

Besides caring for your pony, outfitting it with accessories or giving it small treats like apples, you can also do racing events, trail riding or let it perform tricks. While the player can't control the horse itself in the racing events, he needs to cheer it on through the microphone to keep it going. But if the player shouts too loud or not loud enough, the pony will slow down.

However, it quickly becomes apparent that St. Mystere is quite strange... all the townsfolk seem to be obsessed with puzzles, and Baron Reinhold's fortune isn't the only secret that the town has hidden...

Professor Layton and the Curious Village is a puzzle game which uses the works of Akira Tago, author of the Japanese series of Head Gymnastics books as its basis. As both Layton and Luke, players explore the town of St. Mystere screen by screen. Each screen contains puzzles, either hidden in the scenery or by talking to characters. Upon finding a puzzle, the screen changes and the player is presented with the puzzle itself: the description of the puzzle on the top screen, and the puzzle (as well as the place to input the answer) on the bottom screen. Some puzzles require simple calculation, some have a trick answer, while others are riddles. The selection of puzzles is quite varied. If the player gets stuck, they can purchase a hint with 'Hint Coins'. However, these are limited - more can be found hidden in the game world, but there a set number of coins in the entire game.

Professor Layton has a visual style similar to that of a watercolor painting. While most of the game does not have much animation, key story sequences are told in fully animated and voice acted scenes. The game also used Nintendo Wi-Fi Connection to connect to the Internet and download additional puzzles for players to solve.</desc>

Naturally our heros, Amitie and her school nemesis Raffine, make their way toward the distant dark castle. Challenging, and being challenged by, everyone you come across in a game of, Puyo Pop!  

A puzzle game of the falling-block variety the goal of which is to clear your blocks (Puyos) by is the combining four or more of the same color which will vanish. This will produce Nuisance Puyos. These colorless Puyos will fall onto you opponents screen, thus blocking chains and combos they could create. These pesky Puyos can only be exterminated by removing neighboring Puyos.

When an opponent send Nuisance Puyos to you screen you can try to "offset" by clearing your own Puyos and limiting the number that would fall on your screen. This will also increase your Fever Meter. When this meter fills you will be given a set of prearranged Puyos with which you can wrack up giant combos and send tons of Nuisance Puyos to you opponent. When any players field becomes so full they can no longer drop Puyos they lose the game.

Puyo Pop Fever features a Two Player Mode. Some versions allow for more people such as the DS version which allows up to eight players to compete in free-for-all or team modes.</desc>
	<path>./Puzzle Chronicles (USA) (En,Fr,Es).nds</path>
	<desc>Puzzle Chronicles is a casual game that combines item-matching puzzling with RPG elements, including character progression and a fantasy story line in the vein of Infinity's earlier titles Puzzle Quest: Challenge of the Warlords and Puzzle Kingdoms.

The puzzle part is played on a board with vertical divider line in the middle. The goal is to push the divider line back to decrease the opponent's territory until no more moves are possible. This is done by matching groups of three gems into like colours along the divider line. These groups fall on the board horizontally. Pushing the divider line back is done by destroying rage gems. There are also special abilities and a sidekick known as a Warbeast that attacks the enemy when a sufficient amount of gems of certain colour has been cleared.

Removing gems also enables the player to collect mana, power spells and items that are then used to attack the opponent and reduce their board space. In addition to the main puzzle game, there are five other mini-games ranging from upgrading the Warbeast companion to crafting new items, while navigating a number of different maps and completing simple quests.</desc>

	<desc>Puzzle Kingdoms is a RPG game using tile matching mini-games as the combat system of the battles, in a similar fashion to Puzzle Quest, another puzzle-based RPG with fantasy themes released in 2007 by the same developers. Instead of swapping adjacent tiles to create groups of three or more like in the earlier title, the main gameplay mechanic this time is to move columns and rows to match tiles.

The player controls a hero character, moving between waypoints in an isometric map similar to the ones found on the Heroes of Might and Magic series. The game is divided in campaigns, where the objective is to invade and defeat all the main cities from a kingdom to conquer it. The hero character levels up automatically after winning a number of battles, adding new abilities and fresh spells to the available arsenal.

The battle screen has a grid of tiles occupying most of the central space, with the troops of the two fighting armies lined up at the sides. Each row and column has buttons to move them, and the combatants take turns trying to make matches of three or more of the same type to charge their troops and increase the damage against the enemy when attacking. When one of the troops is fully charged, an attack button lights up at the top of the screen to unleash an assault against the opposite forces. Attack tiles have a similar effect, starting the maneuver when three or more of them are lined up on the grid.

The troopers have attack and defense statistics that determine the outcome of the attacks, with the alignment with the board colors and terrain effects increasing or decreasing their points. The player can retreat, a useful strategy when the battle is practically lost, allowing the remaining troops to be saved. There are four slots below the troop lines for spells, that can be used to change the number of specific tiles on the grid, alter statistics and help in other ways. They are charged by making matches with tiles of their colors.

New troops can be recruited on the outposts, with money received after winning the battles. Shrines, taverns, dungeons and other special buildings have mini-games, with multiple goals like clearing the grid on a set number of turns, making a series of matches within a time limit and other similar challenges. Completing these bonus stages gives new items and upgrades.</desc>

	<desc>Puzzler Collection is a collection of thousands of puzzles in four categories: Fitword, Crossword, Sudoku and Wordsearch. In Fitword, the words shown must be placed in a grid. In Crossword, clues are given and the player must input the word that matches the description. In Sudoku, numbers are placed in a grid in such a way that no duplicates occur horizontally and vertically. In Wordsearch, the words shown have to be crossed out in a grid of letters. 

There are several game modes and difficulty levels to choose from. The Nintendo DS is held like a book during gameplay, and the player can either play lefthanded or righthanded (which determines on which side the player holds the Touch Screen).

The game has five game modes which include:

1. Simply Puzzle, this lets the player pick any type of puzzle for a quick challenge without keeping score.
2. Quick Blast, which offers a number of puzzles based on the amount of time the player has. This can be set to show up daily, for instance for a daily bus trip.
3. Fast &amp; Fun, which adds a timer to increase pressure on the player.
4. Head to Head, a two-player challenge.
5. Tournament, in which the player solves a series of puzzles increasing in difficulty from Easy to Pro.

In the European version, all puzzles are localized.</desc>

	<desc>Bubby and Bobby return in this Nintendo DS update to the popular arcade game, Rainbow Islands.  The game takes place several years after Bubble Bobble, and the brothers now have the ability to create rainbows to destroy their enemies.  However, they'll need this ability, as the residents of the seven Rainbow Islands have been imprisoned, and need to be rescued!

The DS version of Rainbow Islands functions differently from the original. Your character is now floating inside a bubble on the touch screen, and the levels can be seen both on the top and touch screens. You can drag your character around the screen by touching them with the stylus, or you can drag the stylus elsewhere on-screen to create a rainbow. If you tap a drawn rainbow, it will fall down vertically, killing any enemies underneath.

Finally, there are two special rainbows that can be drawn if you hold the L or R buttons, each with their own special function. Drawing a circle will create a large bubble which you can drag around the screen and hit other enemies with; while drawing a triangle will create a kind of black hole that will suck in enemies, allowing you to take them out in one go. Lastly, there is a special rainbow that can only be drawn when your 'Star Gauge' is full: when it is, this gauge can be tapped, and the player is given a short time to draw a five-pointed star (similar to the 'Healing Touch' in Trauma Center). If successful, all enemies on both screens will be destroyed.

In addition to this new style of play, there is also a 'Score Mode'. In this mode, you only have one life, and must earn as many points as possible as a barrage of enemies continues to attack you. The game also has two secret characters to unlock, as well as a Versus Mode where players compete to reach the top of the level first. The special rainbows are not available in either of these modes.</desc>

	<desc>Red Bull BC One is a Nintendo DS game based on a break dancing competition with the same name. It's a mix of a rhythm action game and a puzzle game where players get to compete against different break dancers from around the world.

Before starting the game players gets to design their own dancer. This is done in the dressing room where the players can customize their characters in different categories. It's possible to choose different body styles, hairstyles and clothing. Playing the career mode will let players unlock more clothing that their character can use. 

The actual gameplay consists of performing different dance moves. These moves are shown on the top screen and are done by playing a simple connect the dots puzzle game on the lower screen. Dots of different colour are shown across the screen and the player has to create shapes by connecting at least three dots of the same colour using the stylus. For each turn the player need to create as many shapes as possible before the time runs out. There is also special star shaped dots. If these are included in a shape the player will perform special moves and gain more points. It's also possible to create perfects, which is the largest possible shape of the turn. By creating multiple perfects the player will gain multipliers that will multiply the overall score. 

There's a couple of game modes. The main one is the career mode where players get to battle against different b-boys with the goal to reach the final of the Red Bull BC One competition. There's also the free mode where players can improve their scores of a specific battle. The game also has a multiplayer mode where players can compete against friends in a one-on-one battle via multi card play.</desc>

	<desc>Arino wants to be the greatest gamer in the world, but he's continually defeated by his friends at every new game that comes out. His obsession has spawned a digital version himself within his own Nintendo DS. This digital version of himself has come to be known as "Game Master Arino", who haunts gamers around the world with retro game challenges. You have been chosen by Game Master Arino, and are now trapped in the 1980s until you can defeat his game challenges.

Retro Game Challenge, based on the Japanese TV show Game Center CX, has you playing faithfully-recreated clones of popular NES-era games, attempting to complete challenges and freeing yourself from Game Master Arino. You are accompanied by Arino himself as a young lad, who will cheer you on as you're playing each game. You can also read the latest gaming mags for tips, cheats, and previews of upcoming titles.

There are eight games total, each modeled after 8-bit classics such as Galaga (Cosmic Gate), Dragon Warrior (Gaudia Quest), and Ninja Jajamaru-kun (Robot Ninja Haggle Man). Each game has multiple challenges from Arino to complete, such as clearing a certain stage or earning a set number of points, and can also be played in a free play mode once all challenges have been cleared.</desc>

As each game varies from each other, at the start of each game, you're given a brief tutorial to get the hang of how the game you'll be playing works. Tasks for games include (but are not limited to) flicking to construct machinery, releasing the stylus at the right time to belt out a loud note, sliding to rub a lizard's tail in time to a mating dance beat, tapping to gulp down dumplings, tapping and flicking to harvest vegetables and get rid of moles, and more.

Another addition to the game is the use of the Nintendo DS's Wi-Fi capabilities. Using wireless communication, up to 6 players can race against each other. In fact, up to 6 players can play with a Game Card in only one of the systems. The other 5 players don't even need the game. There will be more items, such as cars, available to play with if all of the systems have a Ridge Racer DS Game Card in though. So there is an advantage to having multiple Game Cards.</desc>

	<path>./Robots (USA).nds</path>
	<desc>Based on the Blue Sky film (distributed by Fox) of the same name,
Robots takes players on an adventure to save Robot city. When Rodney Copperbottom travels to Robot City to meet Big Weld, the famous inventor, he finds that something is wrong. Big Weld is missing and the evil Ratchet has taken over Big Weld Industries. With the help of his friends the Rusties, Rodney puts an end to Ratchet's villainous ways and restores order to the city.

Robots uses a unique perspective that combines 2D side-scrolling with 3D views. The game takes the player to locations from the movie like Robot City, Big Weld's Mansion, the Outmode, and Madame Gasket's Chop Shop. Using the invention mode, players build and upgrade Rodney's weapons including the wrench, scrap gun, electro zapper, and magno grenade. With a combination of navigation, jumping, and combat skills, players can make their way though the world of Robots and bring an end to Ratchet's tyranny.

In addition to the main story line, players will find robots in need all over the city. The parts these poor robots are missing can be found hidden in the numerous maps and returning the correct part rewards the player with power-ups and weapon upgrades. All of the maps are interconnected, so players can easily find their way back to a previous area to uncover additional secrets.The maps are connected with a transit ball mini-game, just like the transit system in the movie.

The DS version of the game features a map that can be annotated by the player, a unique 3D version of the transit ball game that utilizes the stylus for control, and 3D menus. In addition to the new features, the DS also includes high resolution maps that include more detail than the GBA version.</desc>

The battles in Rondo of Swords use the unusual Route Maneuver System. Instead of walking up to an enemy and attacking, instead you will run through enemies to attack. This adds tactical considerations; you can easily attack multiple enemies in a turn, you can run through allies to get bonuses to your attack, and you can attack from the sides or behind to get an advantage.</desc>

Once you've got the girl, you can also take on your friends in multiplayer modes that range from the straight forward high score mini games to the crazy, such as making babies!</desc>

There are three modes - Free Mode, where you can play any of the unlocked games regardless of money, Casino Mode, where you play to win certain amounts of money to unlock games, and Wireless Mode, where up to five players can play single card download over local wi-fi. The controls are fully enabled for touch screen play with the stylus.</desc>
	<path>./Sega Superstars Tennis (USA) (En,Fr,De,Es,It).nds</path>
	<desc>Sega's many franchises come together for a tennis tournament spanning the varied worlds created by them in the last twenty years. Sixteen characters over fifteen different Sega game series are represented, as are ten different courts based on those same franchises.

Exhibition and Tournament modes are included in the game. The first is a simple vs mode, whereas the tournament allows the player to unlock new characters and courts over a series of matches and other challenges, all related to tennis but also drawing heavily on the video game represented. Singles and doubles can be played by either humans or AI, with the player being able to choose his or her doubles partner.

Version differences are notable, as the Wii game misses out on online play in exchange for three different control modes utilising the Wii Remote (much like in Wii Sports tennis, the Wii Remote and nunchuck or the Classic Controller. Online play is included in the 360 and PS3 versions.

Each character has a special move to aid them with their tennis match, relating to the character. For example, Beat from Jet Set Radio has a power that allows the ball to grind against the net and shoot off at a random point, making it difficult to return. 

Minigames are included as both one-offs and part of the tournament. These include a Target-hitting game, The House of the Dead zombie killing game (hit moving zombies around a court before the timer runs out), a Space Harrier game, a Puyo Puyo game, a Virtua Cop game and a Samba De Amigo-related game.</desc>

	<path>./Settlers, The (USA) (En,Fr,De,Es,It).nds</path>
	<desc>The Settlers is a remake of The Settlers II: Veni, Vidi, Vici for the Nintendo DS.

The premise of the game is set to ancient Rome, with you taking control of the Romans in the main campaign, or additionally the Vikings, Nubian and Asian empires in Free Play mode.

The game works very differently from most general strategy games. Your goal is to reach the gateway at the end of each map, usually hidden amidst the enemy lines. You must build military buildings to expand your borders that you can reach the resources that are initially out of your reach. Eventually reaching the gateway to proceed onto the next level. Your city needs roads to optimize the trade routes and allow different buildings to get the resources they need for production.

The game is highly based on gathering resources and optimizing the roads to provide maximal resource gathering. In example, you need a woodcutter to provide a sawmill with logs in order for the builders to build new structures and harbors to build ships for your expeditions.

The game is almost a 1:1 recreation of the original Settlers II game, but it adds few new things to the game such as new music and new GUI to support the stylus.</desc>

	<desc>Named after the television boxing program airing on the US Showtime cable network, this game offers a mix of fourteen heavyweights and welterweights and four arenas to fight in (New York, Las Vegas, Los Angeles and Chicago). Basic moves include upper block, body block, dodging left and right, short punches and powered punches (hook, jab, uppercut, bodyshot). While playing, there are a few parameters to take into account. First there is a health meter that recharges when the boxer dodges hits for some time. Punches need to be thrown strategically, as an energy bar determines the effectiveness. Too many punches deplete the bar and the amount also determines if a boxer will be able to get up when knocked down. A round timer and knockdown lights are also shown. At certain times, a power-up indicator will become available. This allows a boxer to charge a heavy punch, but the opponent will have time to react. When the charging takes too long, the punch is lost.

The different game modes (different for heavyweight and welterweight) include:

1. Single Fights (Quick): fight for only one round until one of the boxers is knocked out.

2. Single Fights (Regular): play for 4, 6, 8, 10 or 12 rounds and choose to decide it by a KO, TKO or by points.

3. Points System: after each round each boxer is awarded points based on performance. At the end of a fight, or after a KO or TKO, the player with the most points wins.

4. Belts: series of three (Amateur), four (Contender) or six (Showtime) fights. Each fight lasts four rounds or three minutes and the aim is to win one of the belts.

5. King of the Ring: one boxer takes on all other boxers in his weight division in one long round.

Additional fighters are unlocked by winning competitions. Most of the modes can also be played with two players through a wireless connection (DS).</desc>

Each character has his own special ability, so you need to figure out little puzzles and switch characters in order to continue.

As the Mayor placed in charge of running their own city, players use the touchscreen to build up and run their town, providing commercial, residential and industrial zones, protection against crime and fire, entertainment areas and even airports, highways and railways for the SimCitizens to travel.

Players also have to contend with natural (and unnatural) disasters, the pressures of an ever-expanding city, and of course, public opinion, which can make a job very difficult if things get out of control.

New to this version is the inclusion of wireless communication with other Mayors via a Post Office. Players can send letters to each other, giving a short summary of the state of their city. When players send letters to each other, they earn special monuments for their cities. Additionally, when disaster strikes, the Mayor can take a more hands-on approach in directly rescuing their SimCitizens.</desc>

	<desc>Sonic's first outing on the Nintendo DS system features action in two screens with a story featuring Sonic getting involved in another one of Dr. Eggman's evil plots. A mysterious Emerald is left behind by Dr. Eggman, but an unfamiliar character makes off with it before Sonic can investigate! Sonic gives chase, and thus the adventure begins.

Playable characters in the game are Sonic the Hedgehog and new character Blaze the Cat. Appearances from other character include Miles "Tails" Prower, Amy Rose, Cream the Rabbit, and Knuckles the Echidna. Each playable character has four moves as well as a variety of "Trick actions" which, when performed, will raise your Tension Gauge. Filling the gauge allows you to do a Boost which will propel Sonic or Blaze at a high speed across the ground or along the air to defeat enemies or move certain blocks.

There are 14 levels that play out over both the top and bottom DS screens, giving you a bigger view of your surroundings. You will race through the levels collecting rings, using "gimmicks" such as bungee ropes and giant waterwheels, performing tricks, collecting power-ups, and defeating enemies. When you beat each level, or "act", you will face a Boss Act which is played out over the top screen in 3D. In addition to these levels, there are Special Stages. These are played on the touch screen, and unlike the rest of the game, feature control with the stylus.

Upon completion of the game, Time Attack mode will be available. In it, you play levels/boss acts for the best time record. Battle Play is a multiplayer mode in which two players compete to finish a level first. It can be played over single-card download or multi-card wireless.</desc>
	<path>./Sonic Rush Adventure (USA) (En,Ja,Fr,De,Es,It).nds</path>
	<desc>While flying in their plane across the ocean, looking for a strange energy source, Sonic and Tails' plane is struck by lightning!  They plunge into the murky depths of the ocean...and awaken on a small island.  A local, a raccoon named Marine, informs them that they are on Southern Island.  With Marine and Tails' help, Sonic sets about to explore the nearby islands.

Sonic Rush Adventure is a side-scrolling adventure game, and the sequel to Sonic Rush. Sonic's goal through these platform levels is to zip through as quickly as possible. By pressing the B Button while in the air, Sonic can increase his Tension Gauge by performing aerial tricks. Pressing Y uses a Super Boost, which will allow him to plow through anything in his path at amazing speed, but drains the Tension Gauge.

When Sonic reaches the treasure chest at the end of each level, he will be given a material that can be used for construction of ships and other devices. At first, Sonic is stranded on Southern Island, but after the construction of the waterbike, he can travel to other islands and explore them. Similar to The Legend of Zelda: Phantom Hourglass, the player must plot a path to the next island using the stylus, and then provide limited control over the ship as it travels. However, Sonic has different ships, each of which are notably different from Link's steamboat.

Sonic Rush Adventure also features a Battle Mode, where players can either play locally with a friend, or across the world through Nintendo Wi-Fi Connection. Players can take each other on in a one-on-one race through various levels as each player aims to get to the end first.</desc>

	<path>./Soul Bubbles (USA) (En,Fr,De,Es,It).nds</path>
	<desc>Soul Bubbles is very similar to Bubble Ghost and requires the player to save lost Spirits by transporting them in bubbles to the exit of each level.

The player takes over the role of a Spirit Herder who is tasked with ferrying souls to the underworld. To move the Spirits and keep them relatively save, they need to be be enclosed in soup bubbles. The Spirit Herder then can blow those bubbles through the level, deflate them if they are too big and even cut them into two bubbles and rejoin them later when required. If a bubble bursts, the Spirit will slowly suffocate and eventually die if the player can't draw a new bubble around it fast enough.

But the way to the Gateway Cube isn't an easy one and it's not just as simple as blowing the bubbles from start to finish in the 40 levels. Besides the natural dangers in form of rocks, plants or hungry critters that all destroy the bubble, there are also environment puzzles waiting to be solved like activating a switch which requires a big bubble. There is also Star Dust and so-called Calabash waiting to be collected. While the Star Dust will increase the light emitted by the Spirits and can be collected by simply drawing a new bubble around it, the Calabashs are well hidden but once the player found them all, he will unlock the eighth World called Agartha, the Land of the Dead.

To help with the search, the Spirits will change their shape to heart if a Calabash is near or turn into yellow triangles if there is imminent danger.</desc>

	<desc>The pixelated aliens are back to celebrate their 30th anniversary!

Taking a cue from other recent arcade classic updates, Space Invaders Extreme takes the gameplay of the 1978 classic, and reinvents it, giving power-up blasters, boss aliens, and an electronic soundtrack that plays in sync with the onscreen action.

Basic gameplay remains the same: Players guide a ground based cannon either left or right, blasting an oncoming fleet of invaders before they reach the ground. The main objective is to get as many points as possible before running out of lives.

Space Invaders Extreme introduces new elements, such as invader fleets that break pattern from their left to right descent, boss aliens that require several hits to destroy, power-ups that enhance the cannon, allowing the player to wipe out multiple invaders at once, while racking up combos.

Wi-Fi play is also possible, allowing player to team up cooperatively, or compete against the other. The Nintendo DS version also has a feature for online ranking.</desc>

This year the iconic Invaders are back again and this time the action is even more extreme! The game combines the essence of the original game with a stunning alliance of futuristic graphic design and cutting-edge audio, overhauled gameplay and a whole new range of amazing power-ups.</desc>

The touch screen of the DS comes in handy to select new special weapons which can be used in the heat of battle to turn the tide.</desc>

	<desc>Junior Nanairo Interplanetary Patrol officers Rallen and Jeena are on a routine mission when they hear a strange distress call. They find the wreckage of an ancient escape pod. Its inhabitant is in cryogenic sleep and when revived tells them about a terrible new threat: the Krawl. The Krawl are an alien lifeform who consume whole planets, and they have already been spotted in this part of the galaxy. 

Fortunately, there is a way to defeat them. This requires the help of an extinct lifeform called Spectrobes. Rallen and Jeena must visit planets to find fossils of these Spectrobes, excavate, awaken and train them. There are almost 500 different ones for the player to collect and trade. To excavate a Spectrobe, the player must first locate it using another Spectrobe. Using the stylus on the touch-screen, one can carefully remove layers of rock and soil to dig up the fossil, without damaging it. 

The fossil must then be taken back to the space ship, put in a machine and awakened by using your voice or blowing in the microphone. The soil also contains various crystals and minerals, which can be used to feed and train the Spectrobes. They will evolve to stronger and more effective stages. 

The Krawl are on the planets in the form of vortexes. Walking too close to them triggers a battle, in which two Spectrobes join Rallen against the enemy. With a combination of buttons and shoulderbuttons the Spectrobes can unleash special attack powers or combine their respective attacks in real time action.

Via WiFi and on a dedicated website players can battle against each other or exchange Spectrobes and items. Special collectibles can be downloaded. Items and Spectrobes can also be added to the game using game cards with holes through which the touch-screen must be touched in a specific order.</desc>

	<desc>Based off the 2007 movie of the same name, Spider-Man 3 puts players in charge of the titular hero as he tries to once again New York City safe from the combined menace of the New Goblin, the Sandman, and Venom.

This version of the game is a 2D side-scrolling platformer with 3D stylized elements. The action is primarily controlled using the touch screen. Players use the stylus for combat, webbing, and item interaction. The game also allows for players to adventure in storylines not explored in the third film, such as facing familiar Spider-Man villains from the comic book mythos.

One of the main focal points of the new game is the inclusion of Spider-Man's black symbiote costume. When Spider-Man's "Rage" meter builds up, the black suit automatically takes over, allowing Spider-Man to become faster, aggressive, and more powerful.</desc>

The single player mode is split into thirty map-based combat and Battle combat missions. During map mode you control your Arwings with the stylus. During combat, you move your Arwing by sliding your stylus to the left/right. Bombs are controlled with the touch screen. You may fire the cannons with any button but Start/Select.

Star Fox Command's six-player Wi-Fi mode plays like the Shine Runner mode from Mario Kart DS and the Star Fox 64 multiplayer game. You shoot your friends down for stars.

Equally startling is the deadly booby trap she triggers in the process of opening a locked door. She barely outruns the giant boulder bearing down on her, escaping the palace only to fall into a surging river, unconscious. The fairy Kukri, imprisoned for centuries in the chamber Anise inadvertently unlocked, rescues her and takes her to the Castle of Albyon. Anise awakens in the presence of the King, whose son is being held by demons in the very palace Anise narrowly escaped from. Recent events have unshakably convinced the King that this thief is descended from the Legendary Hero of Albyon, he who slew the Ancient Demon King centuries ago, and so he commands her thusly: free the Prince from the vile demons... or be tried and convicted as a thief and locked away for life.</desc>

1. Classic

Quest

Relapse

Strategy

Puzzle

Slider

Continuous

Countdown

Initially, only classic and quest modes are available. The rest can be unlocked by playing the quest mode. The classic mode works in the same way as in previous games. The player is presented with a grid that is partially filled with coloured blocks. More blocks are added to grid, one row at a time, from the bottom of the grid. The aim of the game is to remove these blocks before they reach the top of the screen. To remove blocks the player simply clicks a group of three or more like coloured blocks. Some special pieces exists such as bombs that blows up surrounding blocks.

In the quest mode the player enters a strange world where he progresses from level to level. For each level that is completed a new is made available. The quest mode features a store where the player can purchase different things for the money he earns for completing each level. For more money it's also play different casino mini games such as slot machines. All of the game modes are available in the quest mode and after a number of them have been completed they become unlocked for the player to play at any time. 

The relapse mode works like classic but new blocks come in from both top and bottom. In the strategy mode new block will only come in when the player clicks. In the puzzle mode the player has to clear all blocks from the screen and no new appear. In the slider mode the rows of blocks will slide left and right so that the groups changes. The continuous mode is an endless variant of the classic mode and the player has to last as long as possible. In the countdown mode the player has to score as many points as possible in two minutes.</desc>

There are also over a hundred special attacks that can be used against opponents such as Cactus Attack, Panda Shot and Spear to name a few. The new Super Gauge System, when filled, can be given to a player on the court to boosts stats or unleash an "Instant Kill" against an opponent.

Friends can go head-to-head against a friend or even join up against eight people using Wi-Fi.</desc>

	<desc>Based on the movie of the same name, Superman Returns puts you behind the cape of the man of steel as he returns to the earth after his exile in outer space.

Your main objective is to protect Metropolis from the attacks of several enemies ripped right from Superman's comics.
The main campaign gives you a hexagonal map of Metropolis which pinpoints your location as well as your current enemy's location and any disaster areas he may have caused. Since Superman himself is invulnerable, Metropolis itself has a health bar that keeps track of just how much damage the city is enduring, and which measures your level of success/failure.Your objective thus is to move around the map each turn to try and take control of each disaster area which triggers a timed 3rd person perspective sequence in which you control Superman as he flies through the city and uses his powers to solve whatever task is at hand (blowing out fires with his super-breath, destroying mind-control beacons with his heat vision, saving people, etc. etc.) catching up with your enemies triggers a fight sequence in which you must input the correct button-presses on cue to defeat your opponents. In between these rounds story segments that follow the movie's plot play out, which involve a unique 3D action sequence that mimics the movie's counterpart.

Features a single-player campaign as well as two wireless multiplayer modes in which you can face-off against four other Supermen in unique disaster areas to see who gets to clear the objectives faster than the rest. Also includes a gallery of Superman comic covers that are unlocked by collecting Krypton crystals in the game.</desc>

	<desc>At its base, Tetris DS is the same Tetris gameplay that's been around for years: rotate and arrange Tetriminos to create full lines and make them disappear.  However, it also has a style very different from earlier Tetris games, new play modes, and online play.

Graphically and aurally, Tetris DS is based on classic NES games. A portion of the graphics are sprites directly ripped from Mario Bros., Super Mario Bros., Super Mario Bros. 3, Donkey Kong, Balloon Fight, Metroid, Yoshi's Cookie, and The Legend of Zelda. Remixes of music from these games are also used.

Standard mode includes the standard endless play option, the standard "get 25 lines to win" option, and the standard versus mode where clearing multiple lines at once adds lines to the bottom of your opponents' well.

Push mode is a versus game with a twist. The player's moves and pieces are shown on the top screen, while the opponent's are on the bottom screen, both with gravity moving towards the center. Instead of multiple line clears adding extra lines to the bottom of your opponent's well, though, the center is pushed towards their end, giving them a smaller play area. Push back and forth until one side loses.

Touch mode presents you with a tall uneven stack of large Tetriminos. The goal is to nudge or rotate them by dragging or tapping on the touch screen to create full lines and eventually clear the stack.

Puzzle mode offers 200 Tetris scenarios and presents you with a number of pieces. You choose the order and rotation of the pieces to try and empty the well.

Mission mode gives you specific goals like "Use a square block to clear a line" or "Clear 3 lines with an L piece". Finish the mission and you'll be given another. Don't finish the mission and several rows of random blocks will be added to the bottom of the well before being given another mission.

Catch mode has the Tetriminos falling without direct player control. Instead, the player controls a moving core of blocks which can rotate as a whole, as well as latch on to the falling Tetriminos. The goal is to create a square of at least 4x4, causing an explosion which keeps the size of your core small. Lose by allowing your core to get too large, or by losing enough energy; which occurs when you allow a Tetrimino to scroll past the bottom of the screen, your rotating core smacks into and destroys a Tetrimino, or you hit a falling enemy.

Multiplayer Standard, Mission, and Push modes can be played locally using one copy of Tetris DS. Mission allows for up to 10 players competing for a high score. Standard allows for up to 10 players, and has an option for Mario Kart-like items to aid you or harm your enemies. Push mode remains a one-on-one experience. With Nintendo Wi-Fi Connection, you can play a two-player Standard game without items, a four-player Standard game with items, or a two-player Push mode game.</desc>

	<desc>Dominating the exciting world of Theme Park ownership is your goal in this strategy game from Bullfrog. The first task is to set up your rides within the available land, structuring convenient paths and queues and ideally leaving some space for bigger rides once they become available, and include some lakes and trees to increase the park's allure. Rides range from Teacups and Haunted Houses to the biggest most elaborate roller-coaster you can design, and water rides that loop around other rides.

Shops must also be included, so that the visitors can buy food, drinks and souvenirs - the cunning player will combine salt, sugar and caffeine settings to maximize consumer interest. Staff must be hired to keep everything running smoothly, and they will only work for what they consider a fair rate of pay.

You are competing against other Theme Parks, so don't let them get an advantage over you - monitor your success in attracting customers and financial viability closely using the supplied statistics pages. More important, ensure that research is adequately funded to produce new rides.

It can be played in three modes - Sandbox level lets you concentrate on the park design elements, while Sim and Full add more strategic features.</desc>

	<desc>Tiger Woods PGA Tour is the first game in the long running golf series to appear on the Nintendo DS. The game features a Quick Play mode and a Legends Tour mode. In the Quick Play mode the player gets to play single matches either alone or against three opponents. Five authentic courses and one fantasy course are available in the game and the player can choose to play stroke play, match play or skins. The Legends Tour allows the player to take on the best players from around the world. The player starts out on the Rookie Tour but by earning Tour Cards the Pro and Legend Tours are unlocked. By completing events on the tours the player earns cash that can be used to upgrade the golfer's attributes. 

The game features an analog control method using the touch screen of the DS. Before taking the shot the player is presented with a top down of the course that allows the player to adjust his aim. Once that is done two meters appear on the touch screen. One is u-shaped and controls the swing. The power of the shot is determined by how the player draws the stylus on the right side of the meter while the left side determines how straight the shot gets. There is also a boost meter that has to be rubbed repeatedly to add some distance to the shot. Once the ball is in the air the player can influence its rotation by dragging the stylus in the right direction. 

Multiplayer exists for up to four players through wireless communication. All players can play the game simultaneously so no-one has to wait for their turn.</desc>

	<path>./Tiger Woods PGA Tour 08 (USA) (En,Fr).nds</path>
	<desc>Tiger Woods PGA Tour 08 is the second game in the series to appear on the Nintendo DS. The game features touch swing controls where the player drags the stylus downwards to backswing and then back upwards again to shoot. A smooth motion leads to a more accurate shot, while the power of the shot is determined by  how long the backswing is and the speed of the motion. At the same time the accuracy of the shot is determined by the angle of the swing. By sliding the stylus right or left, the ball may draw or fade although too much will lead to a hook or a slice. Once the ball is in the air, a close-up image of it appears on the bottom screen. By sliding the stylus repeatedly across the ball, the player is able to make it rotate. 

A more traditional tap control is also available. With it the player swings by pressing a button to begin a backswing. The swing meter bar will then increase until the player presses the button again to decide the power of the shot. After that the player has to press the button a third time to decide the alignment of the shot. 

The game feature a number of game modes. The play now mode allows the player to play a quick match. The player can customize the game by choosing rules (for example stroke play, match play or skins), course and number of holes. The courses are eight in total and include for instance Pebble Beach and St. Andrews. Up to four players can compete in the play now mode and team play is also an option.

The practice mode allows the player to try out the game in his own pace without any opponents or other distractions. In the Tiger Challenge mode the player gets to compete against the best player in the world for a chance to take on Tiger Woods himself. By winning challenges, more are unlocked as progress is made through the game. The player earns money by winning matches and these can be used to upgrade skills. Last, there is the PGA Tour mode where the player goes through a full season of golf with the goal of reaching number one on the ranking.

Multiplayer exist too for up to four players, both locally on one DS, through single or multi card wireless play or online through wi-fi connection.</desc>

Upset by witnessing devastation that the first World War will cause, he is determined to stop it at all costs, however, his backstabbing assistant Dr. Klaus Scythe takes the time machine and plans to acquire weapons from the future to rule the world for himself and it is up to Dr. Clock to stop him.

The main idea of the game is to fly in 3-D modeled planes, ranging from World War II fighter planes, to modern day jet fighters and up to space fighters of the future. There are 19 levels to explore, picking up various power-ups scattered throughout the level to upgrade armor, firepower and speed.

There is also multiplayer ability using Wi-Fi where players can dogfight head-to-head in the plane of their choice or four players can play in a variety of minigames like racing.</desc>

	<path>./Touch Detective (USA).nds</path>
	<desc>After young Mackenzie's father died suddenly, she inherited the family detective agency.  Now, with the aid of her robotic butler Cromwell and her short but helpful assistant Funghi, she sets out to earn her reputation as the Touch Detective.  She'll chase down a stolen dream, search for a missing person, and more, as she attempts to become well known for her detecting skills.

Touch Detective is an adventure game in the style of later Sierra adventure games such as Space Quest 6. Players navigate Mackenzie through various screens by touching the area where they want her to move. Mackenzie can interact with certain on-screen objects with another tap of the stylus - depending on the object, she may look at it, pick it up, talk to it (if it can strike up a conversation), or even touch it to see what it feels like. Mackenzie likes to feel objects to understand them, which is why she's the 'Touch' Detective. Mackenzie can also check and combine objects in her inventory.

The top screen of the DS always has a close-up of Mackenzie herself. As she talks to other characters, observes objects and so forth, the top screen will display Mackenzie's thoughts - so while she may say one thing to a person ("Sure, I get it..."), she'll be thinking another ("What was that? I wasn't listening!"). It can be interesting (and sometimes insightful) to see the contrast between what Mackenzie says and what she thinks.

Touch Detective features four different 'cases' for Mackenzie to tackle. After the first case is completed, players can also choose to take on the Bonus Case. In this case, there is no main story, but Mackenzie can choose to take on small requests from characters, as well as increase her Touch List, which records the feeling of particular objects in the game world.</desc>

	<path>./Whac-A-Mole (USA).nds</path>
	<desc>This is an adaption of the arcade game Whac-A-Mole, for Nintendo's handheld devices. At the screen you have a 5x4 grid of holes (3x3 in the GBA version). As the game begins, moles will randomly pop up their heads in the holes. Now you have to hit them before they disappear again. DS users will use the stylus and tap the moles, while GBA users will have to use the directional pad to move a marker around the screen.

The game comes with three different game modes. The first is the arcade mode, were you for each level has to reach a certain amount of points before the time goes out. Different types of mole will show up. In addition to the standard mole, there's the golden mole which gives four times as much points as the standard one, and the plush one which gives minus points. Later in the game, you will also meet moles that attack your score, for example ninja and bazooka moles. Various power ups are also available. We have the multipliers, which once active will give you double points for each mole, clocks that slows the time and bombs that do the opposite. Seven worlds are available, each with it's own graphical theme.

The second mode is the puzzle mode, which isn't the same on both platforms. In the DS version you have to recreate a shape that is shown on the upper screen. This is done by tapping moles of different colors. The GBA version has two puzzle games. One is a Tic Tac Toe where you have to hit three moles in a row before your opponent does so. The other is the Peg Puzzle where you have to empty the field from all moles. For each mole you remove, more moles will appear on the screen. The moles will have arrows around them, indicating where the new moles will pop up. However, there won't come any new moles if there already is a mole in that location.

The third mode is a simple quick play mode where you just specify how many levels you want to play and with what difficulty and then try to be successful. The DS version also supports a multiplayer mode.</desc>

Playing as any of the four trainee monks from the TV show (Omi, Clay, Kimiko and Raimundo), it's up to you to recover the mystical Shen Gong Wu by defeating the likes of Jack Spicer, Panda Bubba and Chase Young in wacky Xiaolin Showdown mini-games. But to reach the villains, first you'll need to battle your way through their henchmen, from robot cheerleaders and zombie construction workers to tigers and tuxedo-wearing gangsters.

Adding to the replayability, each of the four monks has his or her own unique moves and special elemental attacks, which you can unlock as you play through the game. You can also use the weird and wonderful powers of the Shen Gong Wu that you collect to aid you in your quest, including the Two Ton Tunic, the Third Arm Sash and the Star Hanabi.</desc>

	<path>./Zendoku (USA) (En,Fr,De,Es,It).nds</path>
	<desc>Zendoku takes the concept of the puzzle game Sudoku and adds role playing elements to it.

The game replaces the numbers 1 to 9 with nine Martial Arts symbols like a panda or a dragon but the original rules remain in place. This means the player still needs to complete a column, row or 3x3 box were every symbol is only used once. The player can test his skills either in Classic Sudoku or in Zen-Mode where he needs to solve Sudoku puzzles under the pressure of time, but the core of the game is the Quest-Mode. 

At the beginning of the quest the player chooses from eight available characters. Four fight with weapons, four freehand but each one has a different quest, uses different fighting styles and has a different lucky symbol. Kingkage is for example a typical ninja. He uses the Ninjutsu-style, wants to be a legendary fighter and has the panda as his lucky symbol. Once a decision has been made. the player follows the story line of the chosen character on a 2D world map and when a fight occurs, the opponents play a round of Sudoku.

Every time one of the fighters completes a column, row or 3x3 box an attack is launched and obstacles appear on the opponents board while an attack icon travels along a rail towards the attacked. If he now correctly places his lucky symbol on the board, the attack will be reversed back his opponent. Placing a symbol incorrectly will make the player lose health and causes several cells on the opponent's grid to automatically fill in.

The game also features a multiplayer mode for two player in which they can either try to solve a puzzle together or play against each other in a battle.</desc>

In this colorful and fast-paced match-up game, players select animals of the same type using either the touch-screen or a standard controller. Line like animals up in rows by swapping them from spot to spot in the time allowed. 

There are 5 varied game play modes: Normal, Tokoton, Quest, Time Attack and 2P. Normal mode has you clearing a set amount of animals each level before progressing to the next. Tokoton is similar to Normal, but has all the animal amounts set to 100 before you'll level up. Quest has you playing ten set stages with specific goals (such as only capturing animals of a certain type) that you must attempt to achieve. Time Attack has you aiming to get the highest score possible in the time limit. 2P has two players battling it out against each other.</desc>

There are around 56 levels in the game and 3 difficulty modes to play. Board size and configuration depend on the wonder you're currently trying to build.</desc>

	<desc>Ace Attorney Investigations: Miles Edgeworth is the fifth game in the Ace Attorney series. It is an interquel set between Phoenix Wright: Ace Attorney Trials and Tribulations and Apollo Justice: Ace Attorney.
This game is a standard "point and click" adventure, with the player controlling Edgeworth's movements and what he interacts with. For each case, the goal is to collect evidence to determine who the perpetrator is, how the crime was committed and their motive. This is presented as a combination of a third-person view showing the characters at the crime scene and through animated close-up images of the characters, annotated by text dialog. In some cases, still images are used to highlight dramatic scenes.</desc>

	<desc>After arriving at the Animal Village, you try desperately to fit in and make friends.  After almost succeeding, a boxing gym opens and all the animals join up.  Looks like you'll have to take part, too.  Get ready to box!

Animal Boxing is a game that requires you to hold the Nintendo DS upside down to play. The player uses the touch screen to punch in a variety of ways - tapping your opponent throws a standard punch, swiping horizontally throws a hook, and swiping upwards throws an uppercut. By holding the stylus on-screen longer, you can charge power for a more powerful punch. The Control Pad is used to dodge left and right, as well as block.

As your boxer takes and delivers hits, their Anger Meter increases. When it is at its maximum, your boxer fills with rage, and all of their attacks become more powerful for a limited time. This can be used to turn the tide in a match. However, opponents can also use this tactic, meaning that blocking and dodging become very important during these moments!

As with other boxing games, your goal is to defeat your opponents in a series of bouts to win the championship belts. Once you defeat the champion, you'll win the belt and progress to the next championship. Each championship you win unlocks new animals to fight against in the Vs. Animal matches, as well as new items to decorate your boxer with.</desc>

	<desc>Aquarium by DS is a fish tank simulation in which the player can choose from 30 different underwater animals.  Additionally, the player can customize their tank in size and add different backgrounds and accessories like plants, rocks or even buildings like the Leaning Tower of Pisa. New fish types can be unlocked by taking good care of the aquariums residents.

And that's the aim of the game, taking care of the fish in the tank. They need to be fed, the tank has to be cleaned and water temp and salinity have to be adjusted to create a perfect environment. A wrong environment or an unsuitable mix of animals in the tank will result in the death of the players pets. Instead of swimming dead at the surface or bloody death animations they simply disappear from the screen. Not playing the game for a few days and therefore not feeding, will result in a deadly surprise, too.

Using the Wi-Fi-feature of the DS the player can swap fishes with other players.</desc>
	<path>./Arctic Tale (USA).zip</path>
	<desc>Arctic Tale is based on the National Geography documentary of the same name. Players control a polar bear (both cub and adult) trying to survive in a harsh climate of snowy landscapes. There are eleven stages where the little bear explores the environment, searches for foods and collects paw prints that unlock pictures in a photo gallery and additional chapters. Later, two other animals can be controlled as well: a walrus that is also able to explore underwater environment, the fast Arctic fox able to hunt down rabbits and an orca whale.

The levels consist of free-roaming environments, on land or underwater, where the animals need to gather food to avoid having the heart icon fade away. While playing 16 different mini-games can be accessed where the player can earn bronze, silver and golds awards to unlock additional chapters. These games include Ice Slide (obstacle course), Shuffle (slide to the center of a ring), Food Fight, Ice Flow Rodeo (control a broken piece of ice through rough currents), Survive the Cold (cross an icy area using shelters to hide from the cold), Catch-a-Seal, Ice Sheet, Clam Scavenge (find eight hidden clams), Herd Flow (guide an ice block without hitting anything), Walrus Hunt, Orca Race and more.</desc>

	<path>./Arkanoid DS (USA) (En,Fr,De,Es,It).zip</path>
	<desc>The latest version of Taito's classic game: Arkanoid.
It features the classic gameplay of the previous games, the player controls the Spaceship VAUS (a moving platform at the base of the lower screen) and its energy ball to destroy the color block (in the upper screen) through each levels.
As usual, there are various power-ups to help through the game (laser, slow ball, duplicate balls, next level, etc.)

The game has one player mode, multiplayer and vs COM modes.

The one player mode consists of the Clear mode and the Quest mode.

The Clear mode is a series of 7 zones of 5 rounds each. There is a total of 28 zones in the game. At the end of the Clear modes, Ananke (the main character and pilot of the VAUS) frees one of his captured friends, these friend's VAUS can then be used in the game.

In the Quest mode, each previously played round is available to replay with a specific challenge (Break all blocks of one color within time limit, or ball launch limit, etc.) Each round gives points that can be used at the shop to buy in-game features to customize it (Blocks shapes, VAUS, backgrounds, etc.)

The VS Com and Multiplayer are similar. You must defeat either the Com or another friend in either Bust All or Bust Color match. The quickest to achieve the goal wins. There is also new power-ups that hinder the opponent.</desc>

Unlike the version for Windows, Wii, Playstation 2 and Xbox 360, which is a full fledged 3D action adventure game combined with minigames, the Nintendo DS version focuses completely on the minigames. The plot, combat sequences and puzzle solving have been removed from the game.

The game does comes with 120 different Olympic challenges. The challenges are divided in 4 categories: Roman, Greek, Gallic and Egyptian. Each challenged is played by rubbing the stylus over the touchpad in a certain way or in a few cases blowing into the microphone. Challenges range from actual Olympic sports like disc throwing to children's games like hula hoops. Players need to obtain at least a bronze medal to continue to the next challenge.</desc>

There are a variety of ATVs and five modes to choose from. The modes are practice, quick race, championship race circuit, championship pro circuit and a multiplayer head-to-head mode.

The game includes a virtual garage in which players can upgrade their ATVs through a touch-screen interface. Tires, suspension, etc can be replaced.</desc>

	<desc>Avalon Code is a hack and slash Action-RPG that takes place in a world about to end.  Choosing between a male or female avatar, the player is given the Book of Prophecy from which the world will be remade.  Everything in the world can be scanned and recorded into the Book of Prophecy, and players can further redefine an entry's properties by mixing and matching pieces of code.  

Codes in Avalon Code are Tetris-like chunks which fit into each book entry's grid of available code space. Think of these codes like genes in a DNA sequence that you can grab and move with the stylus. For example, elemental properties (such as fire) can be incorporated into a weapon, allowing you to melt ice. Removing codes from enemies allows you to weaken them, making them easier to dispatch.

Players string together light combos and can perform charged special moves. Additionally, the player can begin a Judgment Link which juggles the enemy higher and higher (with proper timing) which yields precious HP, MP and Gem bonuses. Dungeons are somewhat unique in that each room is a timed challenge, with requirements such as hitting all switches, defeating all enemies, Judgment Linking xN, and/or various combinations of these.</desc>

	<desc>Help the Biker Mice From Mars, Vinnie, Modo, and Throttle, in their quest to save planet Mars from destruction with the help of the Regenerator, a machine that can create water for the Martians to continue to survive with.  With the original Regenerator destroyed beyond repair, the trio must head to planet Earth to rescue Stoker, who can help them create another.

Biker Mice From Mars is a hybrid of a racing game, and a side-scrolling beat-em-up. Take the role of Vinnie, Modo or Throttle, and race against opponents as well as beating them up in your quest to rescue the planet Mars. During the racing sections of the game, you can fire rockets at your foes (once collected from crates scattered on the track), or boost ahead of opponents. You're also racing against a time limit, and must make it to the end of the track before time is up. Destroying enemies will add precious seconds to your timer.

The beat-em-up sections are fairly straightforward. You walk to the end of each stage, beating up opponents with punches and kicks as you progress. The screen locks into place when a group of enemies appear, and you must beat them before you can move on. The mice can also pick up thrown grenades and throw them back at enemies, as well as climb up and down certain objects to take different paths.</desc>

	<desc>On the island of Voya Nui, the evil Piraka have stolen the six elemental masks of the Toa. It's up to you to explore the island's temples, retrieve the masks, and defeat the Piraka and their minions.

Bionicle Heroes DS is a classic first-person shooter. As a nameless Matoran, you'll travel across 25 themed levels (including jungles, lava-worlds, ancient underground temples) discovering new weapons and new robotic foes to blast apart. Along the way, you'll use the masks' powers to survive the hostile environments as well as collect gears and robot parts to solve simple puzzles by assembling LEGO-style ramps, bridges, and doorways.

The levels in the game are populated by a large visual variety of Bionicle-inspired bad guys, including ones that transform, fly, roll, or charge at you with scorpion-like stingers. Fortunately, you'll be able to upgrade your weapons and destroy them with plasma blasts, lightning, and sniper lasers.

The game also contains a robust local multiplayer mode that allows up to 4-players to compete in deathmatches in arenas laden with weapon and mask upgrades.</desc>

You will gain abilities along the way that will aid you in your adventure. There is the Bomb Kick, Remote Bomb, Power Bomb, and many others. If a wall or enemy stands in your way, just blow it up. Many puzzles and bosses await you in this adventure.

Bomberman's main attraction is the multi-player mode. Up to 8 can battle with just a single game-card. There are 30 stages to play with many different options to choose from. If you are alone, you can still play the battle mode against up to 7 computer controlled bots. There are also voice controlled stages that allow you to plant or blow up your bombs at the sound of your voice.</desc>

	<path>./Bomberman Land Touch! (USA).zip</path>
	<desc>Bomberman Land Touch! is the second Bomberman game for the Nintendo DS (Bomberman being the first game) and it changes the usual gameplay of Bomberman for a mix of adventure and mini-games.

In the story mode, all the bombermen travel to Bomber Island, a pirate theme park, invited by Giant Gold (yellow bomberman), whose father is rich and has rented the park for a day. The goal of Giant Gold is to conquer the island with the help of the rest of the bombermen, all of which are named after their colors: Cheerful White (the player), Giant Gold, Cool Black, Kid Blue, Pretty Pink (the only girl) and Bookworm Green. 

Once the game starts, we control Cheerful White and we can explore the whole island, which consists in 5 different areas: Spades (the starting point), Diamonds, Hearts and Clubs area, where pieces of the same name can be collected, and the castle. This pieces are collected mostly by winning at mini-games, which are usually based on bombs and serve as the attractions of the park, and are used to open new areas of the map. There is also plenty of characters that give you useful information or send you to solve some quest. The rest of the bombermen will also give you info and quests, and sometimes they will wait you at some of the attractions that you finished and challenge you to it.

In addition to this game mode, there is the Attraction mode and Battle mode, both multiplayer. In the first one, all the attractions already won can be replayed. In the Battle mode, which is played only with buttons (unlike in the other two modes), the multiplayer mode of the previous Bomberman is recovered. The only difference between both battle modes (as modes, levels, option etc. are exactly the same) is that each of the contenders have to have their own cartridge of the game in the Land Touch version.</desc>

	<desc>This game plays like traditional Bomberman games except with an experience system. The player must navigate the map on each planet to locate the dungeon and then the boss. Along the way they must defeat enemies and destroy soft blocks with bombs. Every time an enemy is defeated it will display the experience that was earned by the player. After enough experience is obtained, they will level up and gain a new skill like increased number of bombs or fire power.

There are also various types of bombs that can be obtained that have different functions. They are kept in a specific quantity and more can be found from inside soft blocks or defeated monsters.</desc>

As words are formed, they are removed from the grid and the remaining letters collapse to fill the available space. As in Scrabble, players earn more points by creating longer words or words which use less common letters and earn less for smaller words. In November 2006, PopCap Games released a sequel, Bookworm Adventures. Bookworm was released for the Nintendo DS digital distribution service DSiWare on November 30, 2009.[2] It has also been released on the regular Nintendo DS cartridge.[3]</desc>

Set during the Allied invasion of Normandy, North-Africa and Ardennes in 1944, the player fights through 16 different missions in the single player mode, using authentic WWII-era rifles, pistols, grenades, or machine guns.

This 3rd-person action game features intuitive controls enabling the player to shoot, take cover, flank, and out-maneuver the enemy in a variety of battles actually fought in by American paratroopers during the war, while the DS touch-screen allows for squad command. Multi-player features a variety of different gameplay modes for up to four players.</desc>
	<path>./Bubble Bobble - Double Shot (USA) (En,Fr,Es).zip</path>
	<desc>Bubble-blowing dragons Bub and Bob return (now with buddy Bubu in tow) for a more traditional 2D platform romp than earlier DS title Bubble Bobble Revolution, still however retaining some of its gameplay innovations.

The basic gameplay is as has lasted the test of time: expelling bubbles from their mouths, the adorable dragons first incapacitate monsters by enveloping them in bubbles, then put them out of commission by popping the containing bubble (replacing the enemy with a tasty piece of fruit!) -- each level ending with every enemy popped, through ten worlds of ten levels each with a boss fight at the end of each world. A trapped monster, if left unpopped, will eventually free itself, now red, angry, fast and aggressive, and if it takes too long for the dragons to clean up a level, the notorious invincible ghost whale "Baron von Blubba" appears to turn up the heat.

Things escalate in complexity quite quickly, however, considering that each dragon blows a different colour of bubble -- and that some enemies (designated by colour-coded stars) can only be trapped by certain-coloured bubbles. (Complicating things further, some enemies need to be trapped by combinations of two differently-coloured bubbles before they're down for the count. These elements remain even in single-player mode, where the player has the option of toggling their colour mid-game to produce the necessary bubble colour.)

An array of traditional power-ups (shot distance, movement speed, etc.), weapons (lightning bolts, floods and firebombs) and bonuses (freeze enemies, invincibility, flood level, etc.) remain in effect, as does the longstanding E-X-T-E-N-D bonus mechanism -- here regulated (among other effects) through subtle machinations of the new star bubble type.

When player lives are expended, the option of continuing is granted according to player performance in mini-games making use of the DS touchscreen and stylus, ramping up in difficulty through every continue used.</desc>

	<desc>After her sailboat crashed in Mount Tikikola Beach, Patty Melton decided to start a new life. She gets a work at Beach Burger. To her surprise, the owners decide to retire and leave her their business. Now, as the main "chef" in Beach Burger, Patty has to spread her franchise all the way to the capital city of Honochuchu.

Burger Island is an action game which simulates a burger restaurant. The player has to prepare burgers, shakes and fries made of over 30 different recipes. The gameplay consists in clicking in the ingredients and placing them in the correct order for each recipe. For a hamburger, for instance, the player has to click in the burger stack to pick one and then click in the grill to start frying it. The player has to wait for it to get well done and then place it in the bread, adding ketchup and the top slice. Each order has a time limit to be done, or else the customer will quit waiting. Also, Patty starts working at 10:30 AM and ends at 9:00 PM, and has to reach a daily goal. If she fails to reach it, she'll lose a life.

Each stage has a different kind of order to be prepared, being it burgers, shakes or fries. At first, Patty knows only one recipe of each kind of order, but in between levels new recipes can be bought. New recipes are harder to prepare, but are also more expensive. Earning more money is necessary as the stages go by due to the higher goals to be reached. As the daily shift remains the same, more expensive recipes are needed to reach the daily goal.

The game has a total of 60 levels and three difficulty levels.</desc>

	<desc>First installation of the Burnout-series on handheld consoles combines the best features of the first three games: Burnout, Burnout 2: Point of Impact, and Burnout 3: Takedown.  Aggressive racing is still the centerpiece attraction of Burnout Legends and the player's task is not only to win the races but also crash opponent cars as much as possible.  Opponent takedowns, drifts, and other stunts award Burnout Points which in turn unlock new cars and other awards.

One player games can be played as single events or as a World Tour where the player needs to compete in different races and succeed in them in order to advance through five car classes (Compact, Muscle, Coupe, Sport, and Super). In addition there is the Crash mode, where the goal is to create as much wreckage as possible by ploughing the player car into the traffic. The different race types include Race, Time Attack, Road Rage, Pursuit, Face Off, Eliminator, Burning Lap, and Grand Prix. Multiplayer game modes include Race, Road Rage, Pursuit, special Crash modes Double Impact and Party Crash (all these can can be played as single events or as a tournament), and Collector Challenge where the player has the opportunity to win other player's Collector cars.

PSP version game sharing feature allows others to play multiplayer events or single player demo without their own Burnout Legends UMD.

DS version Multi-Pak support allows two player games without additional game cards. More than two player games require multiple game cards.</desc>

This edition allows you to throw the bubbles with the touchscreen and offers over 250 puzzles to play and more to unlock. It also offers multiplayer for up to 5 players over multi card or single card DS Download play.

This game is not to be confused with the Japanese only Puzzle Bobble DS, which does not offer the touchscreen controls, was created by a different development studio and includes different levels.</desc>

When she returned from culinary school, she discovered Evans Bakery closed down because a "Mega-Mart" moved in.  Jill decides to show the mega corporation what her family's baking is all about and opened her own bakery in order to earn enough money to buy back Evans Bakery. Can Jill handle the pressure of running her own business and beat Mega-Mart?

In Cake Mania, your job is to help Jill meet the monthly quota through 48 progressively difficult levels. This is no simple task because you will have to bake quickly as well as serve the customers quickly. 

There are a variety of different customers to serve. From nice old ladies to impatient holiday icons like Cupid! Each kind of customer have a different patience-level (indicated by the number of hearts). The longer they wait, the lower their patience. If they get too low, they will storm off and cost you money!

When a customer first enters your bakery, hand them a menu. Then they will give you their order (in the form of a thought bubble) and you will have to create that cake. If you create the wrong cake (wrong shape or wrong frosting, etc) then you will have to throw it away and start over (costing you more money). You start off with one oven and one frosting machine. Between levels you will have the opportunity to purchase upgrades or new items that will improve the bakery's. For example, you can purchase upgrade your oven to one that bakes faster or you can purchase a T.V. that will help improve customers' patience.</desc>

	<desc>Following the tradition of the Petz series for PC, the series starts now in Nintendo's handheld.

Catz, along with Dogz, is the first of this series for the DS. It's a pet simulation game, where the player can choose between 5 different races of cats. The goal is basically to care for you cat, that is, bath it when it is dirty, feed it when it is hungry, cure it when it is sick, etc. Additionally, many traditional toys for cats are present in Catz to play with your pet, such us, fake mice, small balls with bells inside, etc.

But once in a while, the in-game PDA will show an alert. Here, the game will give interesting real-life advices about cat-caring, and also tasks to be performed by the player. Succeeding at these tasks, like caring for cats of other non-player characters, will traduce into coins, that give the player the opportunity to buy both, toys and costumes for your pet or furniture and decoration objects for the house. And you can also be rewarded with "Kitty Cardz", that give hints on cat-caring or tell facts about them.

Catz is also a multiplayer game. In two-player multi-card mode, Cardz and photos of the kittens can be shared with friends.</desc>

	<desc>Revive the classic shooting game with your Nintendo DS and use your Stylus as your gun to hunt the chickens that you see in the screen or complete the puzzles and reach the highest score under a time limit. The game features different game modes:

Classic mode: Hunt as many chickens as you can in a single stage to reach the highest score under a time limit. It's essentially the classic chicken shoot.

Weight mode: In weight mode chickens approach by air. Move side to side and fire your hefty cannon to the right chicken depending of the color of your weight (your bullet). Three weights of the same color to the same chicken and you've done your main objective.

Gems mode: Here you cannot move side to side. You must shoot the chickens to make them release a gem where three metallic containers reside. Line up the gems to get extra points just like the classic Columns game.

Hotwire mode: A kind of racing game in which you control your car with your stylus. Your job is to drag your car left or right to avoid hitting the side of the track. Every time that you finish the track the speed is increased.

Spot the difference mode: Use Nintendo DS dual screen you'll have to find the differences between two images. The right picture is in the upper screen and you'll have to tap the differences in the touch screen with your stylus.</desc>

	<path>./Chicken Shoot (USA) (En,Fr,De,Es,It).zip</path>
	<desc>Chicken Shoot is a gallery shooting game based on free 2003 flash game of the same name. The player shoots all the chickens that appear on the 2D hand-drawn screens. The top screen is used to show the gameplay, while the bottom one shows statistics such as the remaining time, the score, the type of gun and the remaining ammo. The game can be controlled through the buttons, or in combination with the stylus to aim at the chickens.

The basic game modes are identical to those of the Wii version: Arcade (shoot a specific number of chickens), Classic (time limit) and Catch an Egg (a mini-game where eggs need to be caught before they drop on the ground). Different kinds of guns can be picked up and every now and then enemies thrown an egg towards the screen that needs to be blown up quickly. Extra points are awarded for shooting certain background items, bombs destroy everything on the screen, food can be picked up to refill energy (Arcade) and clocks add more time (Classic). There are six levels/environments: The Village, The Forest, Nevada Desert, Antarctica, Rocky Island and Sahara.

There are two multi-player modes: cooperative gameplay for two players or a four-player competitive game mode where players need to score as much points as possible in a set amount of time.</desc>

	<desc>Some years before the action begins, a great catastrophe began at the base of the Mana Tree. This gives the main characters, Ferrik, Tamber, Poppen and Wanderer, who's parents were killed in the disaster, reason to find out what happened. The game takes place on the Island of Illusia, at the center of which lies the Mana Tree.

The game is a real time Action/RPG very similar to the style of Secret of Mana. New features include dual weapon systems, so characters can use one long range and one melee weapon at a time. 

Although there is much more that can be done with each weapon, there are only four in the game, as opposed to twice as many in previous titles.

The game supports Wireless LAN for 4 players.</desc>

	<desc>What begins as a carefree day at the Millennial Fair for a young man named Crono turns into his ultimate adventure. When Crono meets a young girl named Marle, little does he realize that this young girl, his best friend Lucca's invention, and a mysterious pendant will thrust him into the ultimate trip through time and space, encountering new friends, defeating the forces of evil, and encountering the one who would destroy the flow of time.

Chrono Trigger is a role-playing game, with the usual game mechanics fare for such: the player takes control of a variably large party, developing the combat skills of its members and managing their equipment. As the characters grow in power, not only their ability scores increase, but they also learn new "Techs" - special powerful attacks and maneuvers which cost them "Magic Points" to use in battle. 

The game utilizes the ATB (active time battle) combat system from Final Fantasy games - sort of a mix of turn-based and real-time combat - adding to it combo attacks. Apart from normal Techs, it is possible to use Double and Triple Techniques - super-powerful attacks which involve two or three characters using their abilities at once. There are no random battles in the game, as all the enemies are visible on screen, and it's even possible to just pass by them entirely. 

The game allows you to face your ultimate adversary at different points of time, which leads to several different endings. There is also a New Game+ option, which allows you to carry over your powerful characters to a new game, and adds even more endings to the already existing ones.</desc>
	<path>./Chronos Twin (Europe) (En,Fr,De,Es,It).zip</path>
	<desc>When a mysterious alien being arrives on planet Skyla, the planet's inhabitants tried to make peace with it.  However, its intentions were anything but... destroying all in its wake and forcing the planet's inhabitants to flee as none of their weapons could even harm it.  Study revealed that the alien was able to exist in two different times simultaneously, and could only be harmed in both.  A special time machine was built - one that can transport someone into the past and the present at the same time...

Chronos Twin is a side-scrolling platform game with a difference - the action takes place on both Nintendo DS screens simultaneously. The top screen shows the player in the present, while the touch screen shows the player in the past. Pressing the A Button will make both the past and present player jump simultaneously. While there are certain differences in the past and the present (for example, a platform in the past may not exist in the present), as long as the player is standing on the platform in one time period, they won't fall.

The player also has a weapon at their disposal - a gun which can be fired in the present with the X Button, and the past with the B Button. However - the gun cannot be fired in both time periods simultaneously. The gun can also be charged up by holding down the button, releasing a more powerful blast.

After a certain point in the game, the player is also able to stop time in one period while moving about freely in another period. This can be used to move blocks to allow both present and past players to get through, or to release platforms that a player in one time period couldn't reach.</desc>

Examples of the card games featured include Memory, Blackjack, Rummy and two variants of poker (Five Card Draw and Texas Hold 'Em); board games include Chinese Checkers, Backgammon, Chess and Ludo. There are also DS interpretations of Bowling, Darts and Billiards (9-Ball).

There are three options as far as single-player games go: free play (play any unlocked game as you wish), stamp mode (play through the games in order, collecting stamps per performance) and mission mode (play through a set of missions based within the games).

	<desc>Code Lyoko is a game based on the French animated television series. Five boarding school students - Ulrich, Odd, Jeremy and Yumi - fight against a digital entity named X.A.N.A. They travel to the virtual world of Lyoko and help their virtual friend Aelita fend off X.A.N.A.s forces.

The game follows both aspects of the kids' lives, and the player can enjoy 3D Action Role Playing within the world of Lyoko and 2D Adventuring in the real world.

The game is made of 15 chapters, and each chapter is split into two portions. One portion is a PC-style 2D point-and-click adventure, where you take control of one of the characters to visit different locations, talk to people, gather items, and generally watch the story unfold. The other portion is a 3D action level where you swap among characters and use their abilities to fight monsters, hop between platforms, or climb up hillsides in search of the tower that'll put and end to whatever problem is currently pestering the real world. Occasionally, the player has to solve touch-screen puzzles and pass vehicle-based levels.</desc>
	<path>./Color Cross (USA) (En,Fr,Es).zip</path>
	<desc>Color Cross is a picture puzzle game similar to Picross, where the objective is to fill all the correct cells in a grid to form a picture. Each row and column has a series of numbers as clues, indicating the groups of continuous cells that must be painted. The player must use logic to discover the remaining spots and complete the figure.

The main difference this time is the addition of multiple colors per picture, instead of the monochromatic approach of other titles. Players can select back and forth between colors by clicking on the palette at the side of the screen. Cells can be painted individually or as a group by clicking and dragging across them with the cursor. In each color option, cells can be marked with an X to point them out as incorrect places. Any mistakes are corrected automatically, affecting the final score.

New levels are unlocked with each completed picture. They are organized by picture theme at the level selection menu. Every time a line or column is completed, the clue numbers become grayed out and a shower of candies, fairies and other theme-related items fall from it to the bottom of the screen.</desc>

He and his assistant, Terry, have crash-landed on an unknown island, and the professor needs to make repairs to his ship.  Subtly guide Terry around the island (and later on, the world!) to help them both.

Contact is an adventure game with a difference. The professor from the game is aware of your presence, but his assistant, Terry, is not. You indirectly control Terry by moving him around the game world and issue commands to him. Every action that Terry makes has a corresponding statistic, and these can be levelled up by using them frequently. Run everywhere, and Terry's speed will increase. Take damage, and while your health will decrease, your stamina will increase, allowing you to take more hits. Steal items and your thievery skills will increase, and so on.

The game also supports the Nintendo Wi-Fi Connection. Swap Friend Codes with other people, and when you connect to their game on the Internet, you'll be able to exchange data, as well as send an NPC version of your character into their copy of the game.</desc>

	<desc>Contra 4 for the Nintendo DS is a direct sequel to 1994 SNES Contra III: Alien Wars. Two years after the defeat of Red Falcon - the first wave of the alien colonization fleet, the main invading force Black Viper approaches Earth. The heroes of the original Contra series - Billy Rizer and Lance Bean as well as two newcomers - Mad Dog and Scorpion are now humanity's last line of defense against total annihilation.

This installment of the long-running series adds dual screen gameplay, enabling the player a wider view, and a 2-player co-op mode via local Wi-Fi connection. Each player is now given two weapon slots which can be filled with any one of the game's many weapon power-ups and switched at will with a press of a shoulder button. The game features nine levels set in such classic Contra locations as Jungle, Waterfall and a pseudo-3D Base.
As a bonus, the cartridge contains an illustrated history of Contra, as well as the Contra and Super C original NES games.</desc>

The touch screen is used to slice and soak vegetables, marinade meat, peel fruit and of course cook it on the stove.

The screen allows for more sensitive and easier interaction allowing a more realistic and hands on cooking experience than a mouse or controller could.</desc>

	<desc>Take a break with Crosswords DS.  Hold your Nintendo DS like a book, and choose to solve one of the hundreds of crossword puzzles of varying difficulty.  If that's not your thing, you can also choose from word searches or even anagram puzzles.

Crosswords DS uses handwriting detection to let the user input their answer into each crossword puzzle. Puzzles range from easy to master difficulty, with special 'themed' crosswords becoming unlocked after you solve a page of twenty crosswords. After you complete a puzzle, you are graded based on how many hints you used, and if you used Entry Assist to help you fill in the crossword. Your completion time is shown as well.

Word searches display a grid of letters on the touch screen. Simply drag the stylus across the letters you think form the word, and if you're correct, the word will be marked off the list. Anagrams gives the player a set of letters - these are used to try and form all the words possible with the combination of letters. Each time you successfully discover a word, it is filled into your list.</desc>

	<desc>The fifth game in the Custom Robo series, Custom Robo Arena moves the action into the portable realm again with the first entry on the DS. It is the first in the series to be released in PAL territories, and the second in North America.

The story has the player's character joining the Robo Team 'Numero Uno' and the story unfolds as they attempt to win the Robo Cup. Like all the Custom Robo games, except the GBA incarnation, the battles are conducted in 3D, with the player attempting to defeat their opponent, in a Pokémon fashion similar to the previous games. The touch screen is used to clean off the player's Robo after it becomes dirty, as this reduces its efficiency.

In another first it offers 2 player multiplayer over Nintendo Wi-Fi and allows voice chat and utilises the rivals system seen in Metroid Prime: Hunters.</desc>

	<desc>In this throwback to the early days of CRPGs you must explore the Dark Spire dungeon with a party of up to four characters.

Party creation is basic by most modern standards. 
Four races, three alignments, four classes along with five different stat points are all there are to decide what your character is.

These four characters begin the game inexperienced and weak like almost every RPG. They gain skills, power and better quality items as they progress through the various dungeons.

Experience points are spent on skills for the characters, some of these opening the choice to upgrade one of the 4 basic classes to become a different prestige class, offering different abilities.

The game is played without use of the touchscreen and only uses the direction pad and buttons. The top screen displays the party location in 3d and the bottom screen has info on their status.</desc>

	<desc/>
	<path>./Deal or No Deal (USA).zip</path>
	<desc>Deal or No Deal is based on the TV game show of the same name. It puts one contest against a banker. At the start of the game, the player choose one of the 26 briefcases. They contain prize money ranging from $.01 to $1,000,000. The different amounts are shown on a game board. Each round the player has to open a number of the remaining briefcases which are then marked on the board (six in the first round, five in the second, four in the third). Based on the remaining amount of money, the banker offers the player a deal, a certain amount of money, based on odds. The player can choose to accept the deal when large sums are gone, or decide to go through. After the third round the briefcase is opened and if it contains a higher sum than what the banker offered, the player has made a great deal.

In singleplayer, three modes are available: TV Game (classic gameplay), Vault Game (Find the 3-number combination to a vault in the correct order in as few turns as possible. The initial prize is $500,000 and each turn the prize fund is reduced.) and High Low (Pick a briefcase and then make a calculated guess if the next briefcase will contain a higher or lower sum. For each correct guess, the prize money is increased). Two-player multiplayer offers Head to Head (classic gameplay to get the best deal) or Best Deal where one of the players becomes the banker.

Gameplay consists solely of picking numbers and calculated guesses. No other interactive game elements are present.</desc>

	<path>./Deep Labyrinth (USA).zip</path>
	<desc>Deep Labyrinth is a slow-paced first person dungeon exploration game for Nintendo DS.
The movement is controlled with D-pad, while all of the games attacks are executed through touch-screen. Deep Labyrinths magic system requires the player to draw symbols  Kirie on a 3x3 grid, in order to cast spells. As the game progresses, the Kirie become more and more complex, eventually requiring strings of up to 9 unique symbols.

The game is split into two chapters different enough to be separate games.

In the first chapter tells the story of a boy named Shawn, whose family is stranded on the roadside by a blown tire. His parents go off to find help, but mysteriously vanish. As its getting late, and a storm is approaching Shawn and the family pet  dog named Ace, seek shelter in an apparently abandoned mansion close by, but as they do, both are transported into a bizarre fantasy world. Apparently, this world is a place where unneeded human memories are sent do be erased, and as we find out  Shawns parents memories of him and each other are scheduled for deletion. This sets our hero on a quest to save his family and, perhaps discover the dark secrets of the world of memories.

The second chapter casts you as a hero mysteriously transported into an unnamed dungeon, where he soon discovers a girl trapped in a crystal. The hero has a vague recollection of once knowing the girl, but it is suggested that she died long ago. From that point on the game becomes about escaping the dungeon and saving the girl.

The two chapters are different enough to be separate games. Chapter one is fleshed out with NPCs, dialogue, and story event cutscenes, as well as a several lengthy anime FMVs, while the second chapter is much darker, and features very little in terms of story, focusing on the combat instead.</desc>

	<desc>When Tiger Island is taken over by the evil Wizpig, Timber sends a letter to Diddy to request his assistance.  Diddy, Dixie, Tiny Kong and the rogue Kremling Krunch turn up to help Timber and his friends, Bumper, Tiptup and Pipsy.

Diddy Kong Racing DS is remake of the Nintendo 64 game of the same name. However, while the story and setting remains the same, this is more of an upgrade instead of a port. Players can still race around assorted tracks around Tiger Island via kart, hovercraft or plane, winning races to earn golden balloons to progress and defeating bosses to confront Wizpig.

There have been subtle tweaks to the gameplay. While you can still level up your balloons by collecting another of the same colored balloon in a row, collecting a different colored balloon will not change your weapon - you'll have to fire your current weapon first. The Silver Coin Challenge from the original game has been removed from the main adventure, and is replaced with a first-person touch screen shooter where you fly around on Taj's magic carpet and aim to pop as many balloons as you can. There's also an optional racing mode where you race by using the stylus to guide the vehicle through a top-down map.

The game now supports currency system for most unlockables - dotted along the track are coins, which can be used to buy 'wishes' from Taj the Genie. These include anything from new characters, exclusive tracks, a custom track editor, battle modes to unlock in multiplayer and so forth. The DS version of Diddy Kong Racing also heavily supports multiplayer. You can play with one game card or multiple game cards (to a maximum of eight players), or online to a maximum of six players. Similar to Mario Kart DS, you can design your own custom decal and have it as your visual representation for when you race around the world.</desc>

The gameplay uses many devices from traditional JRPGs, including random encounters and a battle field similar to Dragon Quest. The main goal of the game is to properly raise your team of digital monsters (or Digimon) either by leading them in battle or maintaining them in a Digi-farm. Along the way, you will have to complete dozens of quests which you discover by interacting with your Digimon. When you're not completing side-quests or moving along the main storyline, you can battle and trade with your friends via Wi-Fi.</desc>

Players use the stylus to draw shapes 'magical runes' on the DS touch screen, which then travel towards your opponent on the other side of the playing area. In the playing area is a circular drawing board on which you draw runes that activate your spells, assuming there is currently enough mana to do so. Once cast, a little icon starts moving anti-clockwise around the board, up towards an image of the opponent (at the 12 o'clock position). If it hits your opponent the effects of the spell are manifested, whether it's simply inflicting damage, cursing them with effects. 

Both players players have a shield which can be activated by pressing their own icon (at the six o'clock position). The shield only last few a few seconds before needing to recharge and some spells are able to cut through it, so players need to keep an eye on not only which spells are traveling towards them, but how their spells are likely to be received by their opponent. Tactics are used to combine these runes both in timing and effect.</desc>

	<desc>In the beginning, the Creator built the world and left its people, the lighthearted Raposa, his blueprint -- The Book of Life.

It's been nearly a generation since the Raposa have been in contact with the Creator, and most assume he's left them to take care of themselves. Still, the time has passed peacefully, and the Raposa lived in relative happiness and comfort.

However, the Book of Life has been stolen, and a madman has been reshaping the world according to his own whims. Most of the Raposa have moved away, looking for safer lands, and those who remain plead for the Creator to return and save them from the darkness, which has crept across their village. 

As the Creator, your job is to rebuild your fragmented world, and recover the now missing pages of the Book of Life. Use your stylus and draw your own hero to platform his way to saving the Raposa's world. Along the way, draw your own platforms, vehicles, and all manner of other things. It's up to you to bring color back into the darkened landscape.

The player's character can be drawn for various elements such as torso, head, arms and legs with different color schemes. In the village shop, games, songs, patterns and moves can be bought to travel through the world with 2D-platformer gameplay.</desc>

	<desc>In Electroplankton players interact with various "plankton" to create "media art". Using the DS touch screen, microphone, and other input methods, you can make the plankton to react, creating numerous audio and visual experiences.

There are two modes Performance and Audience. In Audience, the plankton will perform for you, as long as you see fit, or your battery will allow. In Performance you can interact with the plankton and create your own audio-visual show.

The Various Plankton are as follows 

1. Tracy: You will have several plankton. They will move along lines you draw for them, their speed varying on how quickly you drew the lines. The sound they create changes depending on their speed and where they are on the screen. 

2. Hanenbow: These little creatures launch out of a small body of water and bounce off the leaves of plants. Depending on the levees they bounce off of they will create different sounds. 

3. Luminaria: You will have four plankton on a grid. Each has a different speed. Depending on what point on the grid they hit they will make a different sound. Arrows on the grid, that you can alter, will determine where they move. 

4. Sun-Animalcule: You place these little creatures on the screen and they will grow. As the become larger they will create different sounds. 

5. Rec-Rec: Using the mic you can record four samples that then replay with various drumloops. 

6. Nanocarp: These little plankton move about the screen randomly, they will alter how they move according to what you input. Touching one will make it "pling" and clapping twice will make them swim in a circle. 

7. Lumiloop: You spin them around. They glow and make sound according to the direction and speed. 

8. Marine-Snow  Each of these plankton will make a tone when touched, and move about. 

9. Beatnes: Plays NES music and you can create repeating NES-esque music by touching the plankton on various parts of their bodies. 

10. Volvoice: This plankton will record you voiced and the play it back in different ways.</desc>
	<path>./Elements of Destruction (USA).zip</path>
	<desc>In Elements of Destruction the player can unleash the most volatile forces on Earth such as tornadoes, lightning storms, ice storms, earthquakes and meteor storms, wreaking havoc on unsuspecting cities and causing massive amounts of damage and creating complete and utter chaos.

The story tells of a TV weatherman by the name of Marty Storm who is fired from his job for reporting the truth about bad weather conditions instead of lying about good weather conditions in which the station's producer hopes will result in better ratings. Afterwards he vows revenge as his former co-workers ridicule him, unknown to them however, Marty Storm is also a part-time mad scientist that has created a device that can create disasters at will. With this device, Storm goes on a quest to bring the city and his former co-workers to their knees. The gameplay is divided into three weeks (levels) which have seven days, each with their own set of goals. Some consist of causing a set amount of damage, others consist of destroying a certain percentage of building while others consist of destroying certain buildings. These objectives must be done within a certain time limit.

To conjure these storms a menu is on the right side of the bottom screen which has a list of disasters available (some are only available on certain days). After selecting their disaster they use the stylus pen to create a path of destruction for the tornadoes and storms or pick a certain point for either the earthquake or meteors. For the storms and tornadoes, players can click onto them with the stylus and continue to change their path until the run out. Additionally, the player must have a certain amount of energy to be able to select them which regenerates over time or can be obtained by destroying buildings. To help the player, a mini-map is also located at the top of the screen which shows locations of buildings, which types of buildings they are and the buildings health status.

Each storm also has their own special attacks which are only available after they reach a level three later into the game and can be accessed by clicking an icon above the disaster. The tornado becomes much more powerful and has the ability to cause more damage. The lightning storm can cause fires to buildings which the player can then blow into the DS' microphone to fan the flames and spread them. The ice storm causes a blizzard which will weaken buildings for other storms. The earthquake will become more powerful when the player continually taps the center of the earthquake with the meteor storm has the same effect.

However there are attempts to halt the players progress which certain buildings that can instantly stop the players selected disaster. A tornado trapper can suck up a tornado while a cloud cruncher takes out lightning and ice storms. The seismic nullifer prevents earthquakes while the meteor shield keeps meteors from destroying buildings and the weather sucker stops both tornadoes and storms. The storm free zone building prevents any disaster from being performed around it and a weather repeller bounces storms and tornadoes off of them. There are also two types of drones that come in from time to time: a repairing drone will fly around and repair a building while a rebuilding drone will instantly bring a building back without any time to rebuild it. The player can use the lightning storm to hover above these drones and destroy them.

Power-ups are also scattered throughout the level which will upgrade their storm or disaster to the next level for a brief amount of time. To use these power-ups, the player must have their storm or disaster consume them, however the color much match the disaster that is being used, otherwise the power-up will have no effect.

There are also multiplayer modes that support up to three different players. A race mode lets players complete a certain set of objectives given to them with the winner being the first player to complete them. There is also a Tug-of-War where the main objective is to either have the largest amount of destruction monetary wise or through a certain percentage.</desc>

	<path>./Elite Beat Agents (USA).zip</path>
	<desc>Elite Beat Agents is the spiritual sequel to Osu! Tatakae! Ouendan!  In this rhythm-based music game, the Elite Beat Agents are a special task force dedicated to helping people in need and righting wrongs through the power of song. 

The game is played entirely through use of the stylus. Timing is required to line up the rings that close in on the circles to ensure the proper beat for the song. Beats can also be scored by dragging a glowing ball through a set line area until the end of a beat. Finally, players will be required to turn a spinner as quickly as possible during a music break.

The level stories are mostly comedic, where the Agents will help a girl and her jock boyfriend go steady, help a speeding taxi driver deliver a baby, and even help a weather reporter chase away rain clouds to go on a picnic with her son. Each level is accompanied by popular songs such as Madonna's "Material Girl", Chicago's "You're the Inspiration", or Jamiroquai's "Canned Heat", among others, for 19 music tracks total.

Multiplayer allows gamers to compete against each other via single-card or multi-card play.</desc>

Take control of Eragon as he works his way through varies events from the book (and movie.)

	<path>./Etrian Odyssey (USA).zip</path>
	<desc>Far away in a vast fertile land lies a small town called Etria.  Peaceful and serene, Etria became famous when a labyrinth was discovered at the edge of its woods.  Those who heard of the labyrinth began to harbor dreams of exploring it.  And so many explorers from all over the world flocked to Etria in dream of achieving wealth, fame, and fortune exploring the vast and mysterious labyrinth.

Etrian Odyssey is a first-person RPG which pits you as an eager adventurer ready to face the dangers of the labyrinth. At the beginning of the game you are required to create your own "adventuring guild" by creating various characters out of 9 different classes. You can create as many as you want, but everything costs money, so strategic thinking is a must. As well, you can only take a party of 5 into the labyrinth, so the remaining characters have to stay in town at the guild hall. Battles are done in the traditional turn-based style, and he game contains over 125 monsters that guard the labyrinth and the area around it. Movement is done one step at a time, with players moving in restricted directions (forward, back, left right). Most of the game is focused on exploring deeper and deeper into the labyrinth while still returning to town in order to restock and resupply. During the return trips to town, you can also switch out characters in your party if a special class is needed to pass obstacles in the labyrinth. Also, players are only allowed to save during the return trip to town, making trips to the labyrinth both risky and exciting.

The labyrinth is completely unknown and unexplored, and so one of the important features of the game is the necessity to draw your own maps. The top screen of the DS shows the action, while the bottom screen shows a gridded area. In this area, you have to use the stylus to draw out all of your maps. This means not only marking where the walls and doors are, but having to mark where enemies, treasures, special areas, and staircases are. It is completely up to you how accurately or haphazardly you want to draw your map. However, the only way to get out of the labyrinth is to return to the start, so the gameplay becomes even riskier the further you venture into the dungeon. Managing your map poorly may risk you and party's lives. Map making is a key concept of this game because it emphasizes adventuring into the unknown and finding out what's around the very next corner.</desc>

To do so, the player must move Mr. Esc and the Escapees, either with the stylus or the control pad, and have them perform various actions throughout the puzzle-like levels, such as moving boxes, extinguishing flames and breaking icicles.

Each different character possess a different set of abilities and problems. For example, Large People can push heavier objects, but need the help of two Adults to climb higher than 1 meter.

Each level has a timer that indicates the time limit for the current stage. Depending on how fast the level was completed, the player gets a score up to 100%.</desc>

	<desc>Fantasy Aquarium by DS is a fish tank simulation. Contrary to Aquarium by DS by the same developer, which is limited to "normal" aquarium suiting fishes, the player of this game can choose from 30 different underwater animals which can't be held in fish tanks in real life (e.g. whales, dolphins, sharks, penguins). Additionally, the player can customize their tank in size and add different backgrounds and accessories like plants, rocks or even buildings like the Leaning Tower of Pisa. New fish types can be unlocked by taking good care of the aquariums residents.

And that's the aim of the game, taking care of the fishes in the tank. They need to be fed, the tank has to be cleaned and water temp and salinity have to be adjusted to create a perfect environment. A wrong environment or an unsuitable mix of animals in the tank, for example killer whales and penguins at the same time, will result in the death of the players pets. Instead of swimming dead at the surface or bloody death animations they simply disappear from the screen. Not playing the game for a few days and therefore not feeding, will result in a deadly surprise, too.

Using the Wi-Fi-feature of the DS the player can swap fishes with other players.</desc>

The game takes football to the streets of numerous locations all around the world and features 18 international teams and a selection of more than 250 star players. The game can be played with either buttons, or the for the DS unique stylus control. Movement is done with the control pad, all other actions can be done with the stylus. Shooting is done by sliding the stylus towards the goal, while passes are made by touching in the direction of a team mate. When defending a slide is used for tackling. 

Doing tricks is a central part of the series and this DS iteration is no different with a number of different moves. These are done by combining different stylus slides. For each successful trick, the player is awarded trick points that increases his gamebreaker meter. Once full the gamebreaker can be triggered. The gamebreaker is a sort of quick time event where the player has to touch the touch screen when an icon appears. When successful this will lead to a goal. When the opposition gets a gamebreaker, the player can counter it by touching the screen faster. 

In addition to standard friendly matches the game also features a street challenge mode and a kick ups mode. In street challenge the player has to complete events to earn a reputation. To get a high reputation for the player not only needs to win, but to do it with a team with good chemistry so that the team performs as a group. By being successful in the street challenge the player earns unlockables. The kick ups mode is a rhythm action mini game where the player has to touch the screen in rhythm with the music.

Raised as an orphan by Nina and Elder Topapa in the village of Ur, Luneth, his shy friend Arc, the rebellious Refia and the brave soldier Ingus are chosen as the Four Warriors of Light to send to restore balance to the crystals, and save the world from imminent destruction.

Taking the original game which debuted on the NES, Square-Enix had updated the title with a new cinematic intro, improved graphics and a touch-screen interface to move characters and utilize selection menus. There is also Moogle Mail, a Wi-Fi feature that allows players to send messages to each other via their DS systems. The game has also some revised story elements, detailing the adventures of four friends who find each other, each with new backstories.

Final Fantasy III is a traditional turn-based RPG, which were popular back in the '80s and '90s, but introduced refinements to the genre, such as smarter battle AI. Final Fantasy III is also known for two major milestones in the history of the series: Its introduction of the cheerful Moogles, as well as the introduction of the job system, allowing characters to switch professions throughout the game for new abilities.</desc>
	<path>./Final Fantasy IV (USA) (En,Fr,Es).zip</path>
	<desc>Final Fantasy IV is a remake of the classic Japanese RPG that was first released for SNES, known as  Final Fantasy II in the West. 

Unlike the many subsequent ports (to Playstation, GameBoy Advance, etc.), this release is a full remake, programmed from scratch with real-time 3D graphics. The characters have a "super-deformed" touch. There is also voice acting during cut-scenes. A new option has been added to the menu, which allows the player to read a conversation between party members and receive advice from them.

It also features many gameplay additions. The difficulty level has been increased, not only beyond the difficulty of the Western SNES release (which was reduced compared to Japanese original and subsequent ports), but even beyond the original difficulty. The party members are still bound by class, but they can now hunt for so-called "augments", which can be found or stolen from enemies and which grant the characters additional bonus abilities, resistances, spells that their class would normally not allow, etc. 

Beside those major changes, there are also plenty of minor additions. It is possible to obtain bonus items after exploring every corner and filling 100% of an area map; Rydia, the summoner girl, has a new monster summon who can be customized in various ways; there is a new quest involving the "naming" moogle of the original game, etc.</desc>

	<desc>As a man living in the island cities of Sorgele, air pirates loom over the population. They shot down your parents and you are out to avenge their deaths and kill the pirate responsible.

This game is an action flight sim with a twist - it also has RPG elements. Each enemy plane you shoot down earns your experience points and gold, which unlocks better parts and planes for you to buy. Occasionally during flight you receive mayday calls from other planes under attack - if you are able to save them you can meet them back at the nearest airfield for a reward.

If the action is too much for you to handle, it has an autopilot mode which allows you to select targets and waypoints via the touchscreen. There is also a 4 player multicard mode where you can go head to head with friends.</desc>

	<desc>Glory Days 2 takes the premise of Choplifter! and cranks it up a few notches. A strategic component was added that melds old gameplay with new game concepts. There are a lot of playable vehicles that become unlocked as you advance in the game.

The overall goal of the game is to provide air support for your ground troops as they advance and capture enemy bunkers, ultimately pushing them back enough that they retreat. Players can choose from three aviators and there are sixteen missions in total, moving on in time from classic WWII aircraft to modern day helicopters and F14's.

The strategical component allows the player to take command of ground units and manage funds to build new units. These funds are acquired by completing missions such as saving civilians or capturing bases. Progressively, more powerful units and weapons become available. Multiplayer is supported for up to eight players over Wi-Fi, split into two cooperative teams where the enemy's command centre needs to be taken out. The setup of the battles is completely customizable for different parameters.

Optionally, 3D glasses are supported to add more depth to the action on the screens.</desc>

	<desc>Following the tradition of the Petz series for PC, Ubisoft brings now the series to the DS. This time with hamsters.

Like in other games of the series for the DS, the player has to care for his/her pet by feeding it, bathing it, brushing it and other such tasks. There are five different breeds to choose from and seven mini-games that randomly appear to give you food, costumes, toys and items for the cage where the hamsters live. And thanks to the wireless connection to other DSs, hamsters and other items can be shared with friends. The player can even store information on up to other 20 different owners.

Due to its Japanese origin, there are plenty of anime art elements in the game, for instance, and many other Japanese oddities like the possibility to teach your hamster to talk or store the blood type of other players. In addition, in Hamsterz the main goal is to raise your hamster in order for him to make itself a complete "Ham-country" (sic.), where it can build plenty of buildings like a school, a bakery, etc., making this the game of the series where the pet can behave closest to an actual human.</desc>

Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire for the Nintendo DS and Game Boy Advance is a top-down action/adventure game where you play as the three friends and progress through the story based on the book and film.

Make your way through various scenarios by attacking enemies and solving puzzles using spells. One button fires a ranged spell, such as Confoundus, while another is used for stream spells, like Wingardium Leviosa, which can be moved around with the Control Pad. You can also call your friends for added power to your magical spells.

The DS version includes a small bonus game where you take care of a magical creature called a 'Niffler'. It is a simulation game, like a very simple Tamagotchi. You can feed the Niffler, clean it, and give it toys - depending on what you do, it will become more or less pleased with you. Perform well enough, and it will become really happy, and let you pat it to make it even happier.</desc>

Players can also build building and units to help them out by gathering two resources throughout the game, Gaia (which is responsible for buildings) and Treant (for units) all of which is located in the players main base, a large ship. Each unit has a different skill, some are good against enemy units others are used for resource gathering.

Friends can also compete through Wi-Fi head-to-head as well as see their ranking against other players. Players can also earn bonus items and maps through this if their ranking is high enough. The music is also composed by Yoko Shimomura who is also responsible for music in games such as Kingdom Hearts, Legend of Mana and Super Mario RPG as well.</desc>

	<desc>Following the tradition of the Petz series for PC, Ubisoft brings now the series to the DS. This time with horses.

In Horsez the player plays Ginger, a young girl that receives a pony from a friend that leaves the country. Horsez is one of the Petz games that focuses mainly on training your pet in order to participate in competitions. As usual, there is also caring tasks like feeding, bathing, brushing, etc. so the pony grows healthy and strong, but the final goal will still be to train your horse in cross, jump and dressage and win at horse sport events worldwide. Other traditional elements of the series, like dressing your horse and Ginger for exhibition purposes or even toys when the player still owns a foal, also appear in Horsez.

As for the wireless gameplay, in addition to the usual sharing of pets with other game owners, there is also the possibility to send sick horses to the Imagine: Animal Doctor.</desc>

	<desc>In Hotel Giant DS the player is responsible for managing a hotel. In principle the game is played similar to Hotel Giant 2 but adjusted to the capabilities of the platform. The first big difference is that there is no classic free playing mode but only 15 missions where the player needs to reach certain goals. Mostly the player takes over a half-finished hotel and needs to finish furnishing the rooms. The available items were reduced to the most necessary.

When the hotel opens its doors the most time is spent with attending to the cusomer's complaints. After beating a mission it can be played again with self-determined goals. The game is played in real-time but can be paused at any time. A save option is available after every day. There is also a mini game when the player doesn't want to hire cleaners: troubles are indicated with a flash on the mini map. When clicking on it the player needs to make a fast move with the stylus.</desc>

	<desc>I Spy Fun House is another digital adaptation of the long-running series of children's books by Walter Wick, this time with an amusement park theme. The objective is to find and click on all the objects described in a verse at the bottom, on screens depicting locations and attractions of the park. The objects move or display a little animation after being clicked to indicate the correct selection. After all the required items are found, the verse is replaced with a final clue to a hidden ticket.

The tickets unlock new areas and mini-games. Eleven tickets are necessary to enter the Fun House area, while extra tickets open the mini-games. These bonus games are implementations of classic concepts, where the player has to match tiles by swapping pairs on concentric circles, fit tetrominoes shapes inside the limited space of a box, click on the differences between several similar pictures and other challenges. There are no hints or hint button available to show the location of the objects, and no time limit or penalty for wrong clicks.

The Windows/Macintosh CD-ROM release includes a 3-inch promotional mini-disc, containing one riddle from each of three earlier I Spy games: I Spy Fantasy, I Spy Spooky Mansion Deluxe, and I Spy Treasure Hunt.</desc>

	<desc>In six hours the evil Professor Elvin Atombender's nuclear missiles will launch and destroy strategic locations on the earth. Only one agent can infiltrate his secret base and undertake this Impossible Mission.

The goal of Impossible Mission is to acquire nine passwords and bring these to Atombender's Control Room in time to shut down the rockets. Unfortunately these passcodes (contained on punch cards) have been broken into four pieces each, and each piece hidden in computers, furniture, and waste bins throughout the base. On top of that Atombender has an entire army of robots patrolling the base. If a robot touches or shocks the agent then ten minutes are removed from the clock and the room is reset. The agent can jump over robots, but the only way to stop them is to expend a specific item on a room's computer terminal, and even that only disables them for a few seconds.

The 2007 release of the game has a few improvements over the original version, mostly to improve the graphics and make the game easier. The player can select one of three agents, although all of them possess the same abilities. Robots are now color coded according to what they are capable of doing (yellow only patrol, red patrol and shock, blue can follow and shock), but some aspects of each robot's personality can still only be figured out by watching or approaching them. Finally an easy mode has been added that adds an extra two hours to the clock and marks rooms which you have cleared out of items. The original mode with the original graphics can also be played, as well as a "mixed" mode that uses the old avatar graphics, makes all robots the same color, but keeps any other graphical upgrades.</desc>

	<path>./Infinite Space (USA).zip</path>
	<desc>Growing up as a second class citizen on a back-water planet, Yuri dreamed of being able to travel the stars. After many years he saved up enough credits to buy transport off the planet, but space travel is forbidden to second class citizens, and he is chased by the security forces of the corrupt owner of the planet. To survive the dangers of space Yuri must become a captain, buy and customize star ships, and fight against hostile enemies both on the ground and in space.

The majority of Infinite Space's gameplay involves space ships, both in fighting and in modifying. All ships have a certain amount of space for extra modules to be added, and the abilities and shape of modules must be considered when choosing how to outfit a ship. In ship to ship combat you can control the distance your fleet is from the enemy fleet. During combat a command bar charges. You can use a small amount of the command bar to Dodge, use more to fire a Normal salvo, or expend almost all of it for a Barrage, which fires three times as many shots as Normal. If the opposing fleet uses Dodge before a Barrage then every shot will miss, leaving the attacking fleet at a disadvantage. If a Normal salvo is fired while the opposing fleet is Dodging, then every shot will hit and deal extra damage. Extra combat options come into play with larger star ships equipped with fighter hangars, special weapons, boarding parties, and officers with unique abilities.

The story progresses primarily with text dialogue and the occasional FMV. Sometimes the player is prompted to make a decision in dialogue for Yuri, and these decisions can have far reaching consequences. Additional officers can join Yuri through the story, by hiring them at a mercenary office, or by finding them on various planets. All officers have unique stats and abilities that make them better for a particular role, such as doctor, engineer, or pilot, than others, and these stats and abilities increase in level from combat.</desc>

There are many elements to the game, having the player interrogate suspects using good cop/bad cop techniques and interview witnesses in a story-based style. Players can also explore environments for clues, track suspect bugs and attack enemies with gameplay for this utilizing the stylus for aiming and the D-pad to move the main character and the L&amp;R shoulder buttons to fire the weapon of choice.</desc>

	<desc>Mostly based on the 2008 movie Iron Man, this videogame of the one-man-army hero has been released for seven different platforms. The NDS version, by A2M, is the most different one.

The game of Iron Man puts you under the skin of Tony Stark. He is a billionaire weapon-industrialist and genius inventor who, after being kidnapped by terrorists who want to force him to build weapons for them, builds an armor instead to escape. Since then, he decided to stop producing weapons and keeps on working on the suit to fight them back.

The games take the story further, giving the player the chance to go through 8 different missions, divided in by air and by foot missions, and even fight villains that do not appear on the movie, like Whiplash and Titanium Man. All this is shown through images between every mission, which use the voices of the actors of the movie like Robert Downey Jr. and Terrence Howard.

As for the game mechanics, by foot or by air, with the first armor at the beginning and in the characteristic red and gold suit later, using range weapons or melee attacks, the game features Stark fighting with armies of soldiers, tanks, helicopters, canons, etc. with the help of an array of upgradeable weapons like missiles, micro-grenades, repulsive shots, EMP blasts, a flame thrower and the powerful "Unibeam". Both the weapons and the suit (propulsion and armor systems) are upgradeable using the points that each mission regards you.

In the handling section, the next approach is used: move with a given set of controls, aim with another. In addition, there is also a button for repulsors (extra propulsion) to fly faster. The NDS touchscreen is used for aiming 360-wise, touching in a given direction from the center of the screen, and the pad is used for moving.</desc>

	<desc>Jenga World Tour is a take off of the popular board game in which you take blocks from the lower part of a block tower and set it on top without toppling it.  The premise is the same for the video game, using the Wii remote, you pull the blocks while moving the remote and using "A" button while using the "B" button to tap them out gently to keep the stack from toppling over.

There are several different backgrounds (in the pit of a volcano, medieval England, underwater, prehistoric times or even the Himalayan Mountain) you can play in, each having their own special differences, such as blocks freezing in the Himalayan stage or only being able to hold onto hot blocks in the volcano for a limited time or even avoiding catapults in the England stage.

There is also an arcade mode where you play a continuous game of Jenga or you can play against a friend in multi-player mode. The Nintendo DS runs along similar lines, using the stylus pen to pull out and tap blocks out of place, but doesn't have the same levels as the Wii version, but does have the same kind of effects (i.e. ice blocks, cement blocks and even UFO attacks). You can also play against a friend using Wi-Fi.</desc>

	<path>./Jewel Match (USA) (En,Fr).zip</path>
	<desc>This is the Nintendo DS release of the well-received match-3 game Jewel Match for Windows/Macintosh. Due to the limited screen size of the handheld, the grid size of the levels had to be cut down from 14x14 to 12x12 tiles, thus forcing a complete redesign of all the levels. While at it the developers added some DS-only gameplay options like the new magical storm where the player can blow into the microphone to reshuffle the jewels. 

The basic idea of Jewel Match comes from Bejeweled / Diamond Mine - the player is presented with a grid of jewels. By swapping pairs of tiles which are next to each other, rows of three or more identical jewels can be formed that will disappear instantly, giving points to the player and making room for other gems falling from above to take their place. The levels have gaps and shaped areas, though, so pieces do not simply fall vertically but also can fall diagonally.

Jewel Match has its own victory criterion though. On each of the 150 levels, a selection of squares have gold or even silver backings. One match (gold) or two (silver) must be created over each of these against a ticking clock to clear the level. Later in the game there are jewels tied to their square with a golden or silver chain, which thus are not falling down and blocking empty squares beneath them. These jewels can be freed by matching them once or twice, too, which means that the most difficult squares must be matched four times (silver chain and silver background) to be cleared.

A succession of hammers are unlocked once you have scored a certain amount of points. The first removes a particular jewel, the second not only removes the gem but also any effects (background or chains) on the square, and the final one removes all gems of that colour. Another extra to be unlocked is a magical storm that will have the player blow into the DS microphone to mix up the jewels. Moreover, matching more than three jewels in a row will create gems with special powers. Matching four will create a joker gem while matching five gives a gem that, once activated, will destroy the whole row it is in. 

The game also offers a hot seat mode where two players can play the same level right after another, competing for the better clearing time.</desc>

	<desc>In this version of Brain Training designed for 6-11-year-olds, Junior Brain Trainer gives younger players a chance to practice important key skills in reading, writing, spelling, maths, geometry, logic and problem solving. It takes a different approach to the formula, by delivering information in smaller sessions, making it easier to take in. Gameplay is designed to suit a childs attention span and ensures they are frequently occupied.

Unlockable games include:

1. Ghosts - use the stylus to touch a ghost and capture it. As many as possible must be caught within the time limit.

2. Twins - a memory game requiring pairs of people to be matched up against a time limit.

3. Snakes - a game of skill and timing that requires a snake to be guided around the screen to collect coloured sweets.

4. Football  the stylus is used to move a football boot across the screen kicking a ball against the wall to remove bricks.

5. Beggar My Neighbour  tap on a pile of playing cards with the stylus to play a move against the console. Whoever has the highest card wins the hand.

6. Balloon Pop - the D-pad is used to move a sling shot to the left and right. The A button fires at the balloons and pops them.</desc>

	<desc>The DS version on Justice League Heroes, while not following the plot of its console brethren, has a similar premise where you play as a member of the titular super-hero team and travel to a number of locations where hordes of enemies run amok.

The game is played with a top-down view of the environment on the lower screen and a map on top. The map displays the location of your next checkpoint and the positions of the enemies along with the status of your characters. The lower screen, in addition to the action, has various function icons that can be activated with the stylus.

There are about a dozen missions broken into about forty sections. Before each, you must pick two heroes from the line-up of Superman, Batman, Wonder Woman and Flash. Each has regular melee attacks, strong melee attacks, a ranged attack and a unique super-power move. They must use these abilities to defeat many enemies and move to the next checkpoint, completing objectives such as switch-flipping and item collection along the way. You may swap between your two heroes at any time by tapping an icon on the screen. Another icon lets you call in an AI-controlled hero for brief support. There are six of these to choose from: Martian Manhunter, Zatanna, Green Lantern, Aquaman, Green Arrow and Huntress. Each of these has a unique ability based on their powers.

In addition to the main game, there are two minigames and a third can be unlocked by inserting Justice League Heroes: The Flash into the GBA slot.</desc>

The touch screen displays the melody at the top that you must follow, and the three bars below represent the different note 'types' that you can play - either by tapping, or by sliding the stylus along the note (depending on the difficulty level). Based on the accuracy of the note press, you'll be awarded "GOOD", "KIRA²" "RAINBOW", or "MISS" if you fail to hit it.

A story mode is included, where the player progresses by completing songs and unlocking new ones for play. They also earn money, which can be used to purchase clothes and accessories for their in-game avatar to wear. There are also photo booths where the avatar can pose in a variety of ways for the camera.</desc>

Kirby Super Star Ultra is an updated remake of Kirby Super Star, a popular SNES game which is broken up into seven main games. In addition to those previous games, Ultra includes five new games and three new sub-games. Listed are just some of the new ones:

Revenge of the King: King Dedede wants a rematch! This game is a toughened up version of Spring Breeze, the opening game.

The Arena: Every boss that Kirby has met throughout the game, one after the other! Try to beat them all!

Meta Knightmare Ultra: Play through the first five games as Meta Knight, with his own special abilities and powers! Speed is the key!

Kirby Card Swipe: Watch the top screen, and quickly pick the correct card. Be the first to do it thrice!

Kirby on the Draw: Enemy targets pop up, tap them as they appear. Don't tap the bombs!

Snack Tracks: Eat all the food on your tracks. Don't eat the bugs, bombs or rocks!

As with the original, Ultra features a heavily featured multiplayer mode. All games can be played either co-operatively or competitively. Spring Breeze can even be played co-operatively if your friend doesn't have a copy of the game!</desc>

	<desc>A great war once raged across the land with many a valiant knight falling on the field of battle. In the end, the evil forces have prevailed, and have since taken over and corrupted the once great kingdom. On a stormy night a Wisp is awakened by a strange armored maiden. The wisp holds the memories of the war, and is now seeking all the valiant dead to be brought back to the world of the living in order to complete their mission and take back the land that was once theirs.

Knights in the Nightmare can be loosely summed up as a Strategy RPG, but it is played like no other Strategy RPG in existence. The game is almost entirely stylus controlled on Nintendo DS, and combines the active-timer turn-based combat of a game such as Final Fantasy VI with elements of bullet-hell top-down shooters, and relies on a set of unorthodox rules for completion of its goals.

Once in the field of battle the player controls the Wisp who can cause the spirits of fallen heroes inhabiting the area to temporarily reconstitute into their physical form and do battle with monsters that now roam the land. The player can recruit those warriors permanently into their party by seeking out objects that meant something to them while they were alive.

The game features a robust character customization system that includes many classes of units, multiple jobs per each unit class, and a soul transplant system that allows the player to transfer all attributes of one player into another.</desc>

	<desc>Konductra is a touch-based game where players can challenge one another via the Nintendo Wi-Fi Connection and battle head-to-head by matching colorful tiles and attempting to block the opponents progress. Players can square off against the computer, complete challenging tasks, or rack up high scores to practice for matches against the greatest puzzle masters online.

Konductra challenges players to create and destroy lines with colored tiles to either earn points or attack an opponent. Four game modes are offered, including Task, Score, VS. CPU, and VS. Human. In both versus modes, the objective is to beat the opponent by filling up the rivals board as quickly as possible by destroying lines on the players own board and sending them to the opponents board. Gamers destroy lines by matching tiles and using the stylus to trace from like colored conductors running along the four edges of the screen.</desc>

	<path>./Kung Fu Panda (USA).zip</path>
	<desc>In this game based on the 2008 DreamWorks movie of the same name, the player is Po the panda. Po finds out that the best kung fu masters have been captured by the evil Tai Lung. Po is fat, loves to eat dumplings, and is pretty slow and clumsy at kung fu, so he is shocked when he is asked to go rescue them. Although some elements have been changed, the game's theme is largely identical to the movie and linear in design.

Po's journey consists of finding the five kung fu masters, mastering a new skill that they teach him, then continuing on to find Tai Lung. This game is a 3rd-person side-scroller with frequent use of the touch screen and seems largely based on the mechanics and engine employed in the DS version of Spider-Man 3.

Po's movements are controlled through the D-pad while attacks are performed by swiping the styles on the touch screen. These are also used to throw objects and perform the learned special moves. Most of the gameplay consists of hand to hand combat with enemies, and traversing levels by consulting your top screen mini-map. New moves are learned gradually and there are also small puzzle elements where Po needs to interact with the environment to progress.</desc>

	<desc>Labyrinth is the sequel to a SNES game called On the Ball.  The object of the game is to manipulate a ball through a maze to the checkered goal line.    To do this, players must rotate the level around to navigate their way through obstacles.  The ball is constantly falling towards the bottom of the screen, ignoring whatever direction the maze is facing.

There are two ways to control the ball. The first is by using the L and R Shoulder buttons to rotate the maze left or right. The other method is to rotate the maze map on the touch screen using the stylus. Players can also briefly surround their ball with lightning which will shatter certain blocks. It's also possible to customize your ball - you can increase or decrease the weight of your ball, as well as change the colour and material it is made from.

In addition to the single player mode, Labyrinth also features a Single-Cart Multiplayer mode. In this mode, up to four players can take part in making their way through the maze. The first player to reach the goal is the winner.</desc>

Players can explore various different environments on the island from the beach to the jungle interior.

Lost Magic is a game that where the primary focus is combat, with little in the way of exploration to interrupt the main theme of the game. The stylus is used to direct the player's allies, (monsters captured by Isaac)and to cast spells.

The focus of the game is capturing monsters to later help the Isaac defeat the more powerful foes. Up to 400 different spells can be cast, many in combination with others to create new effects. The challenge lies in using the stylus quickly and accurately to not only combine these spells, but to effectively direct the real time battles.

The game supports Wi-Fi as well as both single and multi cartridge versions of multiplayer.</desc>

	<desc>Luminous Arc is a strategy role-playing game. 

The story is set in a world in which there are two groups in apparent opposition: the Luminous church, and the witches. 

During the course of the story, the player controls a party made up of orphans who have been raised by the Luminous church. They are called the Garden Children, and are tasked with the condemnation of witches. However, soon after the beginning of the story, it becomes evident that things are not as clear-cut as they initially seem.

Structurally, the party moves from area to area, and the plot advances as the player progresses through battles. Equipment may be powered up through the use of a vitae forging system. Also, relationships with characters may be strengthened during post-fight "intermissions," leading to some bonuses in future battles.</desc>

	<desc>Many years into the future, a race of vampires have emerged, plunging planet Earth into darkness with an environmental control system called the 'paraSOL'.  They now control the planet, with humans living in fear.  When all hope seems lost, two boys with amazing power emerge to save the planet.  The Dark Swordsman, Lucian, and a rookie member of the vampire fighting 'Guild', Aaron.

Lunar Knights is an indirect sequel to the Boktai series of games, which takes place many years after. Its focus is much more on action as opposed to stealth, although some stealth elements from the earlier games remain (for example, you can blow into the microphone to whistle and attract the attention of enemies). Players control the two characters, Lucian and Aaron. Lucian fights with a huge sword called 'Vanagand'. As a result, Lucian has a close combat style. Lucian uses the power of moonlight to fuel his special attacks and moves.

The other character is Aaron, a gunslinger for the Guild. He fights by using sunlight to charge up his gun, the Knight, and shoot ranged shots at foes. Aaron's special attacks and moves use up sunlight. Both Aaron and Lucian can use junk materials to increase the level of their weaponry, giving them more power.

The main goal of the game is to make your way through the dungeons and purify the vampire at the end. The dungeons themselves are fairly standard - you search for treasure chests, avoid traps and solve puzzles. At the end, you'll fight a boss vampire, and once you've defeated them, the Casket Rocket will be called. Because the vampires have blocked out the sun on Earth, you'll need to take the vampire into space to purify them.

At this point, the game becomes a touch screen controlled shooter. To control the ship itself, you drag it around the screen with the stylus. To shoot enemy ships, you tap them with the screen. Once you reach the end, the vampire will be purified by the magnified power of the sun.</desc>

	<desc>Madagascar Kartz is a racing game based on DreamWorks Animation's Madagascar. It was released on October 27, 2009 and the second game on Madagascar's spin-off series.

Gameplay[edit]
The game is a basic kart racing game, and the player can perform jumps, flips, rolls.[1] There are many different stages from scenes of the franchise.[1] Playable characters include Alex, Marty, Gloria, Melman, King Julien, Mason and Phil, or all four of the penguins.[1] The Madagascar Kartz Wheel is bundled with the Wii version of the game. This wheel is optional. This wheel's look is different from that of the Wii Wheel from Mario Kart Wii.[1]

Playable characters include Alex the Lion, Marty the Zebra, Melman the Giraffe, Gloria the Hippotamus, The Penguins, The Chimps, and King Julien from the Madagascar. Two characters from other movies are included alongside the Madagascar, Shrek from Shrek, and B.O.B. from Monsters vs. Aliens, all DreamWorks Animation franchises. Race types include Quick Race, Championship, Time Trial and Checkpoint race. A Championship race is one where the player collects mangoes and tries to finish first place in order to unlock higher speed classes (50cc, 100cc, 150cc, 200cc, the last one is raced in reverse direction/mirror mode), more karts and tracks. In Time Trial, players beat their own times and earn medals (gold, silver and bronze). In Checkpoint Race, players collect as many hourglasses as they can before the time runs out. There are several tracks in the game. Also, in a track, most tracks have 2 shortcuts. "I Like to Move It", sung by Reel 2 Real, is the menu theme. The game's gameplay is similar to those of Mario Kart Wii, by Nintendo. The sequel is Super Star Kartz.</desc>

	<desc>Magical Starsign is Role Playing Game about a group of students at the Will O Wisp magical academy. When their teacher mysteriously disappears they set out to find and rescue her. As she is on a different planet, this involves space travel. The player starts out alone, but one by one the classmates join the quest.

The students are each specialized in a different art of magic, linked to a starsign. As the planets move through the sky (as seen on the 'astrolog') the magic associated with that sign grows stronger and weaker. This applies to the monsters as well, which adds a strategic element to the gameplay. 

As characters grow stronger, they learn new spells. During combat, players tap on the attacks they want to use and then tap on an enemy to target. By tapping the character's head at the exact moment they release the spell, the attack is extra effective. 

There are two multiplayer options. The first, tag mode, allows players to exchange data with one another. In the magical rocket, an egg will hatch that will slowly develop into a new unique character. In the amigo dungeon mode up to six people can explore an 'amigo dungeon'.</desc>

Marbles will relentlessly roll across twisted tracks and into a hole in its center. When three same-coloured marbles touch each other, they destroy themselves. With the DS Stylus, players must shoot same-coloured marbles into the oncoming rows in order to prevent them from falling down the hole and thus clear a track. The twist is that now, marbles that share the same color will attract each other!

Magnetica takes advantage of the Nintendo DS hardware for precise touch-screen functionality and brings a new play mechanic to the famous puzzle. Test your ball-shooting skills in Challenge Mode, Puzzle Mode, Quest Mode and more.</desc>

Removing matching blocks reveals the ones below, until the entire board is cleared or the player is stuck. The game includes a help function and blocks can be immediately selected using the stylus. There are different themes of blocks to choose from, including classic Chinese characters but also more general symbol. The game keeps track of the remaining blocks, the score, and there is an undo function.</desc>

	<desc>Based on the documentary March of the Penguins, this game follows the story of the emperor penguins as they embark on a long journey to breed their young. The game has been divided into twelve chapters, with different gameplay. The penguins need to be navigated through the environment, find a suitable mate, find food, take care of the egg, guard the young ones and finally make it all the way back.

A large part of the game is based on the concept of Lemmings. As the penguins march on, players need to help them land softly, melt obstacles, attract them in a certain direction using fish and place trampolines, ramps, slides, bridges and steps to make them access new areas. The levels can be explored using binoculars and the penguins need to collect a certain amount of snowflakes to pass. The penguins cannot die. When they fall off a cliff, they simply restart at the beginning of the level, but the players needs to bring them to the end as a group to succeed.

Other levels have the penguins slide down hills with faster gameplay, feature mazes, or take place underwater where predators need to be avoided while collecting food. In the later parts of the game, guarding the eggs adds an new layer of difficulty. As soon as a penguin hits an obstacle it is dropped. There is little time to pick it up again or it freezes. It also need to be taken to a warm spot before the thermometer time runs out.

Some educational content has also been included. Next to the habits, more information about the penguin migration in provided in between levels.</desc>

	<desc>Square and Nintendo reunite for a unique take on the basketball genre in Mario Hoops 3 on 3. Mario Hoops uses almost exclusively the DS stylus to play both offense and defense. Despite having all the moves you would expect from a basketball game the rules are quite different. Instead of 2-3 pointers. You collect coins along the ground which affect your score if you make a basket. Games can get on average up to 300 points.

On the offensive side you can tap the screen to dribble the ball, swipe in your teammates direction to pass, stroke up to dunk, and show your impressive ball handling skills by dribbling the ball in full 360 degrees around your character.

On the defensive side you can do everything from jumping, to stealing, to blocking. The game even allows for goal tending. This isn't your fathers basketball game.

Included in the game is the ability to rise through the ranks in tournament mode, play against your friends in multiplayer one on one, and hone your skills in challenge mode. With over 15 courts, unlockable balls, and more than 18 of the most popular Mario and Square characters.

Playing tournament mode pits you and your team of 3 players up against 3 teams in a battle for the typical Mario style cups. While doing so new characters, courts, and balls will be unlocked all of which you can use in singleplayer or multiplayer.

There are two multiplayer modes. One of which is a race to see who can get 100 points by dribbling. This game is 4 player and supports DS download play. The main multiplayer mode is a 1 on 1 battle. Each player has 3 teammates and battles in two periods to see who can get the most coins.</desc>
	<path>./Mario Kart DS (USA) (En,Fr,De,Es,It).zip</path>
	<desc>Mario Kart DS is the continuation of the long running racing game series that began on the Super Nintendo. It features 16 new tracks as well as 16 tracks from the previous 4 games, with each set split up into the Nitro and Retro Grand Prix respectively. Eight racers are initially available, each with two go-karts to choose from. A number of characters and additional karts are also available to unlock. New items have been added to the arsenal, including a Blooper squid that squirts ink onto the screens of other players and a Bullet Bill power up that transforms the player into a giant, fast-travelling bullet on autopilot.

One of the features of this version is its support for online Internet play through Nintendo's WiFi service. MKDS owners can challenge up to 3 other people in Grand Prix mode on 20 of the 32 tracks. Players can also match up with friends by trading "Friend Codes" that are generated based on the DS that is used and the copy of the game owned. Custom emblems to use on karts are supported through the game's paint program.

Battle mode is also present with 8-player support and 6 tracks. This time, there are two modes to choose from: "Balloon Battle" and "Shine Runners." Balloon Battle is similar to the previous versions of this mode, with the exception that every player starts with only one balloon, and 5 in reserve. Players can have 2 additional balloons by either holding the Select button while standing still to inflate them, or by blowing into the DS's microphone. "Shine Runners" tasks players to collect "Shines," with the winner being the one that has the most.

New to the series is "Mission Mode," which consists of a series of single player objective-based missions. Each mission takes place on a section of a race track and tasks the player to accomplish goals not normally seen in the other game modes. Such tasks include picking up coins on the track, using items to take out enemies, and racing through numbered gates. Missions are split up into 6 sets of 8, with a 9th mission for each where players must battle against a boss character. 

Local wireless multiplayer is supported for up to 8 people in Grand Prix, VS, and Battle Modes. Time trial "ghost" data can be shared as well, and DS owners who don't have the game can use the Download &amp; Play option to join in Grand Prix mode. However, non Mario Kart owners are limited to selecting Shy Guy as their character.</desc>
	<path>./Mario Party DS (USA).zip</path>
	<desc>Mario Party DS continues the Mario Party gameplay on the Nintendo DS. It is a multiplayer game played as a board game. Each player can choose between well known characters from the Mario universe such as Mario, Luigi, Princess Peach, Yoshi, Princess Daisy, Toad, Wario and Waluigi. Players play mini-games to earn stars. At the end of the game the player with most stars wins the game.

It is possible to play the game with four players in multiplayer. With download-play only one cartridge is required. Each round the players roll dice to advance on the board. Somewhere on the board a star is located, which can be collected by the first player to reach that spot. After each round the players play a mini-game, this can be free for all, 1 vs. 3 or 2 vs. 2. The game includes 74 different mini-games and some of them use the stylus or microphone.

At the end of each game more stars are rewarded for the player who for example won most mini-games.</desc>

The gameplay involves head-to-head battles where players recruit superhero characters with various strengths and powers onto the playfield. Each character has a basic Attack and Defense value which determines the outcome of individual character battles. This basic mechanic is augmented by character powers, Equipment cards (which give the character additional powers/stats), Location cards (which affect multiple cards or game rules while they are face up), and Plot Twist cards (which are often played to change the outcome of individual character battles by boosting Attack or Defense values).

The game features two single player campaigns, tutorials, puzzles, and an online mode similar to Magic The Gathering Online. The online mode supports cross-platform play between the PC and PSP versions.</desc>

	<desc>Master of Illusion is different from other exercise games. This one is a take on magic, teaching the player but also performing magic tricks against the player itself. There are three different modes including Solo Magic, Magic Show and Magic Training.

In Solo Magic, a magician performs parlor tricks such as guessing what card the player has just picked out or guessing by the hand gestures the player makes over the DS screen.

In Magic Tricks, there are fourteen different tricks to try where the game is more of an assistant, helping the player out performing your tricks including having a friend pick out a card and drawing a face at the bottom of the screen that will guess the card picked out. It can also guess a person's birthday or where they are going on their vacation. Some of the tricks have the player recite different things through the microphone, for instance the vacation trick, or the player needs to blow into the microphone.

The third mode is called Magic Training, which is more of a series of mini-games to help test reaction speed. There are step by step instructions of how to perform tricks and there is also a special deck of cards that comes with the game.</desc>
	<path>./Master of the Monster Lair (USA).zip</path>
	<desc>Master of the Monster Lair is a dungeon crawling RPG with a different twist, whereas in previous dungeon crawlers the objective is to find the dungeons and monsters to clear them, the player creates the dungeon (or a monster lair in this case) in order to attract the monster and trap it to destroy it.  There are 23 different rooms to customize for the player's Monster Lair.

The story takes place in a small town called South Arc where the nearby forests are harboring monsters who regularly invade the town and scare of the citizens. This is where the player takes control of an orphan called Owen who is searching for his first job where he encounters a magical talking shovel. After realizing his destiny, he decides to start digging a lair and destroy the monster infestation.

The view of the game uses the DS dual-screen technology, showing the world in the top screen while the bottom screen will show maps and item menus. The gameplay is the standard turn-based RPG battle, selecting options from a menu such as attack and casting spells as well as the option to turn and run from the battle.

Players can pick up items and currency from monsters that are defeated in battle and use them to buy new weapons and armor for future battles or even furniture for Owen's house. There is also wireless capabilities where players can view and exchange dungeons through Wi-Fi.</desc>

Mega Man Zero
Mega Man Zero 2
Mega Man Zero 3
Mega Man Zero 4

In addition to the four games, Mega Man Zero Collection also features an art gallery with works from the games in the series. The e-Reader cards that were exclusive to the Japanese version of Mega Man Zero 3 and provided in-game enhancements are now discoverable throughout that game as collectibles. There is also the option to play through all four games in one continuous playthrough, rather than having to select each game individually. Finally, an included "Easy Mode" makes the game more accessible to those not used to the game's tough difficulty level.</desc>
	<path>./Mega Man ZX - Advent (USA).zip</path>
	<desc>Grey was a Reploid found in a hidden factory in suspended animation, accidentally awakened during battle.  Ashe was a human Hunter, chasing after treasures and bounties.  After their encounter with the evil Prometheus, they were rescued and taken to a Hunter Base, where their first mission was to help transport a mysterious Biometal.  With another attack on the train occurring during their mission, they attempt to protect it - the Biometal, Model A, fuses with them, allowing them to become a powerful Mega Man!  But other people are after Model A as well...

Mega Man ZX Advent is the sequel to Mega Man ZX. Players can choose to play as either Grey or Ashe, each with their own storyline and slightly different weaponry, but the overall game remains the same. The game itself plays much like the side-scrolling platformer Mega Man X. However, once the main character fuses with the Biometal, they can transform into Model A, which allows them to steal the data of bosses, taking on their appearance as well as their abilities.</desc>
	<path>./Mega Man ZX (USA).zip</path>
	<desc>Many years after the events in the Mega Man Zero series, humans and Reploids (humanoid robots) have at last found peace.  Two humans, Vent and Aile, work for a delivery company called Giro Express.  After being ambushed during a delivery, they come in contact with something called 'biometal', which transforms them into the Maverick Hunter, X.  Using their new powers, they decide to work for a group called "The Guardians", who protect civilians from Maverick attacks.

Mega Man ZX is a side scrolling platformer for the Nintendo DS. While the gameplay is similar to the Mega Man X series, in that you find powerups to increase your health meter, gain subtanks to store surplus energy when needed, and gain new abilities such as swimming and flight through acquiring boss powers, the art style is more similar to the Mega Man Zero series of games.

As players progress through the game, they gain the power of different types of "biometal", which gives them robotic weaponry and abilities. Different situations require different biometal suits, and sometimes (such as in civilian areas), it's best to return to your human form so that you can make your way through areas without being hassled. New models of biometal can be acquired from boss enemies. While you can hit their weak spots for more damage, it's actually beneficial not to, as the more damage you do to the weak spot results in more repairs that you need to make to the biometal later.</desc>

	<path>./Metal Slug 7 (USA).zip</path>
	<desc>Metal Slug 7 is the eighth entry in the Metal Slug saga and an exclusive to Nintendo's DS handheld system. The player chooses from six different heroes (Marco, Eri, Tarma, Fio, Ralf and Clark) as the embark on a mission to stop the diabolical (and persistent) General Morden as he unleashes hordes of henchman and machinery to stop the player, as well as make allies with a new and more dangerous army in the process.

Like many others in the series, the gameplay is basically the same, having the player using the D-pad to move their character around on the screen and using the "Y" button to fire their primary weapon. The "A" button is used for throwing grenades and the basic melee attack as the player comes in close quarters with an enemy with the "R" button to change their primary weapons.

There are some new melee attacks as well when using the D-Pad and pressing the "Y" button to unleash the attack, each attack differ depending upon the character selected. Also, four characters (Marco, Tarma, Ralf &amp; Clark) have a special attack that can be used by pressing "Up" on the D-Pad and hitting the "L" button and the "Y" button. Along with these new attacks, the game also utilizes the DS' dual screen capabilities with the main game being played on the top screen and a scrollable map on the bottom screen that show's locations of freed POW's and items picked up as well.

The standard power-ups are also present such as heavy machine gun, rocket launcher and laser gun to name a few as well as the ever dangerous "Metal Slugs" that are scattered throughout the seven stages of the game, ranging from the standard tanks to jet fighters and even bi-pedal tanks. There are also three difficulty settings to choose from: Beginner, Normal and Hard.

A new feature is the 80 mission Combat School option which allows players to partake in a series of special missions that will award players depending upon the required action of the stage (ex. some stages will score the player on how many soldiers they destroy while other's will score the player depending on how many POW's they rescue). The better the player does during these missions, the more points they will be awarded and raise their ranking which ranges from "Recruit" to "General of the Army".</desc>

	<path>./Meteos (USA).zip</path>
	<desc>Designed by Masahiro Sakurai and produced by Tetsuya Mizuguchi, Meteos was the DS's second big-name puzzle game (after Polarium).  

Most of the game's action takes place on the bottom of the DS's two screens, where colored meteors plummet downwards towards a planet's atmosphere. There, they form columns that the user can manipulate with either the stylus or a combination of the D-pad and A button. When three or more meteors of the same color are arranged either vertically or horizontally, they "ignite" and rocket up towards the top screen. Rockets carry upwards any other metors that happen to be above them, and by stringing together several ignitions it is possible to lift many blocks at once. The ultimate objective of the game is to lift as many metors as possible back into "orbit" in the top screen; the game is over if the bottom screen fills up completely with meteors. Meteos features many different "planets" that the user can play on, each with subtle variations (such as in gravity) that affect gameplay.</desc>

	<desc>In this pinball game based on Metroid Prime, Samus gets knocked and rolled around the table in Morph Ball form; the table contains Metroids, which can latch onto her and suck away health. Tables include the surface of Tallon IV, the Space Station, the Phazon Mines, and more can be unlocked by searching for artifacts and collecting bounties, which are found by destroying Space Pirates and other dangerous creatures.

Metroid Prime Pinball is a pinball game with a Metroid theme. Players can collect power-ups such as missiles and super bombs, which can be helpful when defeating bosses. There are also missions to be completed within a time limit; these missions can involve defeating unique enemies that appear on the table or completing tasks such as wall jumping. Completing missions earns either artifacts or special tokens.

The game also features a single-card multiplayer mode. In this mode, up to eight players can play. The game is a race to see who can reach a certain score first. Players lose points if they lose their ball. It is also possible to dump enemies onto opponents' tables to cause trouble for them.</desc>

Match up the colors correctly to destroy an invader, or knock them around to create a chain attack. This makes the game halfway between an action game and a puzzle game. You'll need reflexes to destroy the aliens fast enough, and brainpower to attack them correctly.

Monster Bomber features a scenario mode, with a branching series of challenges, (complete with save/load) as well as survival mode and multiplayer.</desc>

	<desc>Fairy Tale World is in trouble!  With less and less children reading fairy tales, people will forget the stories and Fairy Tale World will disappear forever.  The monsters who feature in all of the fairy tale stories don't like this at all, so they take it upon themselves to rescue their world.

Monster Puzzle is a puzzle game similar to Zoo Keeper or Bejeweled. You have a set grid of monsters that can be dragged with the stylus either left and right or up and down (up to a maximum of three spaces). If you match at least three monsters horizontally or vertically, that row of monsters will disappear. If you match up a 2x2 square of monsters, a 4x4 square of monsters will be deleted.

Unlike Zoo Keeper and Bejeweled, the goal is not to just eliminate monsters. Instead, players must 'claim' spaces where the monsters lie, which is done when you clear a set of monsters. In most stages, you will just need to claim the space once (which turns it orange), but in later stages, you will need to claim space twice (which turns orange spaces to red). After a certain percentage of space is claimed, the player moves onto the next stage.

The game can also be played in versus mode with a friend. In this mode, the player who runs out of time first is the loser. Time can be added by continuing to clear monsters. If you clear multiple monsters simultaneously, a rock will appear on the opponent's screen which makes it more difficult for them to clear monsters.</desc>

	<desc>Renegade Kid returns to the DS with this second game, Moon. After updating the Renegade Engine, used for the first game, Dementium, this new shooter for the DS puts you in the role of Major Edward Kane, Chief of Military Operations for the Extra-Terrestrial Encounter Organization. The year is 2058 and you and your squad are sent to the moon to investigate strange things that have been happening at the new moon bases. An alien hatch has been discovered at the construction site of one of the bases. So you need to take charge and take care of business.

As its predecessor, it tries to fill the lack of shooters for Nintendo's handheld. With the stylus for aiming, the D-pad for moving and the shoulder buttons for shooting, Moon revisits the late 90's style of shooter started by the Quake series.

The game features 24 episodes, 7 different weapons, various levels of difficulty, bonuses and other game modes to unlock.</desc>

	<path>./Myst (USA) (En,Fr) (Rev 1).zip</path>
	<desc>You have just stumbled upon a most intriguing book, a book titled Myst. You have no idea where it came from, who wrote it, or how old it is. Reading through its pages provides you with only a superbly crafted description of an island world. But it's just a book, isn't it? As you reach the end of the book, you lay your hand on a page. Suddenly your own world dissolves into blackness, replaced with the island world the pages described. Now you're here, wherever here is, with no option but to explore.

Myst is a first-person point-and-click adventure where the player controls a character known as The Stranger. Magically transported into the world described in the book, he needs to explore Myst Island and solve its mysteries. The game is presented as a series of static scenes where the player acts with the environment by clicking and manipulating objects. There are no enemies and it is not possible to die. Through Myst Island, the game is further divided into mini-worlds set in different ages accessed through different books.

The PSP version adds new adventure scenarios and includes widescreen support.

The DS version includes a completely new age, the Rime Age, and, next to a code rewrite, includes new and re-mastered sound effects and video clips.</desc>

	<desc>A shooter of the vertical scroller type, Nanostray is similar to past games like Raiden and Tyrian to mention but a few. 

Players unlock features (concept art, backgrounds etc.) by fighting through an adventure mode, which in turn allows finished levels to be played in arcade mode, which is purely for attaining high scores. High scores in arcade mode can be logged on the games official site for ranking against other players around the world.

Adventure mode also allows players to tackle missions in non linear order, however all three in one group must be finished before the next three can be attempted and so on.

The touch screen is used for current status and to scan the end of level bosses for weaknesses.

Challenge modes are added when adventure levels are completed, allowing players to play through the game with a set of restrictions, making high scores more difficult, but increasing the challenge and lastability of the game.

Two players can fight competitively to get the highest score before a timer ends or be the first to reach a certain predefined limit of points.

The game supports single cart play for multiplayer so only one copy is needed.</desc>
	<path>./Nanostray 2 (USA).zip</path>
	<desc>Nanostray 2 is similar in gameplay to the original Nanostray, but has a few new features.  You can play over thirty missions with over six different game modes to play in.  You can play the Adventure Mode, which shows cut-scenes to tie into the story or you can skip the story and play Arcade mode and just go for the highest score possible.

You can also play in challenge mode, completing a set of four challenges that unlocks a new simulator mode challenge, which is similar to Arcade mode, but with a different scoring system. It has sixteen massive bosses and over one hundred different types of enemies and you can change control styles, using the classic or using the left or right handed touch control. There is also a Nanogauge that fills up when you destroy multiple enemies, earning you bonus multipliers.

You can play against a friend in duel mode or play in cooperative mode using multi-cards and can also upload your high scores online using the Wi-Fi connection.</desc>

Taking place in a massive, open city, NFS Underground 2 allows players to explore the city at will, engaging random challengers and moving into the coveted Underground Racing League. Once in the Underground Racing League, the player advances first by race wins, then with building up their tuner car and taking on tougher opponents. The objective is to win all Underground Racing League engagements and trick out your car to the max.

The PC version is the only version that allows the user to save magazine screen shots of your tricked out car to disk.</desc>

	<desc>At its core Nervous Brickdown is a Arkanoid-clone and the first ten levels feature the familiar gameplay of using a horizontally moving paddle at the bottom and a ball to destroy bricks at the top of the screen. But each of the ten worlds (divided into 9 levels and one boss fight) feature a different type of gameplay.

In the second stage the player needs to draw the paddle on the screen himself to knock the ball against ink blots. Depending on the form of the drawn paddle, the ball will bounce off differently. And to spice things up even more, the paddle isn't restricted to just horizontal movement anymore but can instead be freely moved around at the bottom of the screen. Other stages require the player to move through a haunted house and kill ghosts by blowing into the microphone or contain a laser beam which increases it's speed. 

By playing successfully through the levels, the player unlocks bonuses which range from extra lives to the ability to change the trajectory of the ball by blowing into the microphone.

The game also features a multiplayer mode for two players in which the ball changes into the player's paddle color so it will only bounce off the paddle with the corresponding color.</desc>

	<desc>Onpu Island is an island populated by musical spirits called Ontama. These strange, multicolored creatures can allow skilled performers, called 'Ontamaestros', to perform music by gathering Ontama. Beat and Rest, two young friends from a small village on the island, find an Ontama on the street. They discover that the Ontama are being captured, and so they set out to find out what's happening to them, and to become Ontamaestros themselves.

Ontamarama is an action rhythm game that makes full use of the DS' capabilities. Ontama appear on the screen, and can be tapped, tossed, and circled. Clearing an Ontama makes fills a note on the bar along the top of the screen, and when the note reaches the end of the bar, the correct button must be pressed to play the note. There are four different colored Ontama, and you also need to watch out for the white and black ones which can help or hinder you in other ways!

The game includes a story mode, a tutorial mode, a free play mode where you can play songs cleared in the story mode, and a challenge mode. There is also a shop where you can buy songs and items with points acquired during the game.</desc>

	<desc>Open Season is based on the Sony Pictures Animation's CG animated film of the same name, where a rowdy brood of forest animals turn the tables on a bunch of unsuspecting hunters.  

The game is a side-scrolling-puzzle adventure. The plot of the game is to complete puzzles and avoid traps to advance from level to level. Every level completed will raise your friendship with the different animals of the forest. Once friends, these animals can be used as allies to attack and defeat the hunters encountered along the way.

Following the plot of the movie, once the player has become friends with a sufficient amount of animals, he can then take on the evil hunter leader Shaw.

The gameplay loop is to find clever ways to solve puzzles that prevent you from moving forward in a level. To solve these puzzles, the player can switch between the two main characters : Boog, a 900 pound bear and Elliott, a crazy deer. Both characters have their specific skills which need to be wisely used to progress through the levels. To solve most of the puzzles, Boog and Elliott, each controlled individually and seperately, will have to work as a team.

To complicate the gameplay a bit, the player will encounter hunters on the way which he can defeat "using" the now friendly skunks, beavers, squirrels... which all have their unique skills.

This game is a 2,5D side-scrolling game with an emphasis on spatial puzzles. The story mode contains 27 levels. In addition, there's also eight minigames.</desc>

	<path>./Over the Hedge (USA).zip</path>
	<desc>A portable adventure game based on the animated movie of the same name and which chronicled the adventures of a group of animals in their struggle against a recently-built housing development.

Playing as either RJ, Hammy or Verne you'll have to complete several incursions into the human dwellings to steal food, supplies and sabotage further housing developments.

Gameplay-wise the game is a 3rd-person perspective stealth-adventure hybrid in which you must navigate through several houses looking to retrieve your current objective while avoiding the many traps set by the homeowners (as well as the homeowners themselves). To get by you can make use of several unique items that allow you to set up diversions, or create them yourself by blowing into the microphone. Each character has individual strengths and weaknesses and in many missions you'll have to alternate between each character to successfully complete the level. 

As a unique feature the game displays the standard 3rd person perspective on the top screen while the lower screen features a top-down view which allows you to better scan the levels for traps and items, both rendered with fully polygonal graphics.

Features a single player campaign and a wireless multiplayer mode with a two-player mode in which two players compete to clear out a level of food.</desc>

Erwin plans to siphon spectral energy from the Spectral Realm to power his army of robots in order to rule the world. Pac-Man uses punching, Rev Rolls, Butt-Bouncing and various new Power Pellets to defeat Erwin and his minions. Pac-Man also pilots Toc-Man in a battle against Erwins robot army.

Joined by Pac-Mans old enemies, Orson, Clyde and Pinky, and new friends along the way, Pac-Man adventures through different levels from a boneyard of old bots to a burning tower, up mountains, through deserts and the Spectral Realm to destroy all of Erwins Spectral Syphons. In this title, Pac-Man has also been given full speech, voiced by Martin T. Sherman.</desc>

	<desc>Pac-Pix originally started as a tech-demo for the Nintendo DS when the DS was first announced. Many people at E3 liked the demo so much that Namco made it a full-fledged game. In this DS exclusive title, Pac-Man has been captured by the ghosts and you must save him. You use the touch-screen to draw Pac-Man and try to eat the ghosts.  There are a few different types of ghosts that require a different strategy for each type.

You have Pinky that just moves around slowly and Blue that will make a quick dash as you approach him. There is Numboos which is multiple ghosts with numbers and you must eat them in order if you wish to defeat them. Bari-Boo has a shield and you can only defeat him by attacking from behind, if you hit his shield in front of him or from the side you just bounce off. There's the ink ghosts which throw ink and then there's the block ghosts which require you to break their defenses with a bomb.

During your adventure you will learn to draw arrows to shoot ghosts and stun them, as well as ghosts that are floating in bubbles. You will also be able to draw bombs to destroy blocks that are in your path. There are many things to do with the touch screen in this game. Pac-Pix is a Pac-Man game like no other before it.</desc>

	<path>./Picross 3D (USA) (En,Fr,Es).zip</path>
	<desc>Picross 3D is a pseudo-sequel to Picross DS.  As with the original game, your goal is to uncover the hidden image by using the number clues as your guide.  But unlike Picross DS, where the puzzles were flat, in Picross 3D, each puzzle is encased in a cube of a varying size and shape.  By chipping away and rotating the cube, the player can reveal the hidden picture.

Picross 3D has approximately 350 puzzles, across a variety of different themes. Each puzzle is grouped into a particular theme, such as "Beach", "Sports" or "Fire", and when all the puzzles are found for a theme, a medal is added to the theme to indicate that it is complete. Nearly every puzzle has a possibility for a three star rating. To earn all three stars, the player must:

solve the puzzle
complete the puzzle within the time limit
not make any mistakes

As with Picross DS, Picross 3D features a puzzle creator. The user can create their own puzzles, and then, using Nintendo Wi-Fi Connection, send them onto the Internet to trade with friends, as well as receive additional ones.</desc>
	<path>./Picross DS (USA) (En,Fr,Es).zip</path>
	<desc>Picross DS is a touch screen-based puzzle game for the Nintendo DS.  By following the numbers on the left and top of the game grid, players can uncover the picture hidden away.  The rules are simple - if there is one number on a line, say, 10, then you know that there are ten squares in a row that must be chipped away on that line.  If the numbers read something like 2 7, then you must chip away two squares somewhere in the row, separated by at least one empty square, and then seven squares to be chipped away.  By applying these rules horizontally and vertically to the grid, you can work out the picture using logic.

There are two methods of control: you can use the Control Pad to move a cursor, the A Button to chip a square, the B Button to mark it, and the X Button to zoom in or out (similar to Nintendo's previous Picross games). Alternatively, you can use the stylus to play. In this mode, the Control Pad changes the functions of the stylus. When you press Up, you'll chip squares, Down will mark them, Left will zoom in and out, while Right allows you to scroll. The buttons on the right of the DS perform the same functions, which is helpful if you're left-handed.

Picross DS has a variety of different modes:

1. Picross - This is standard Picross. Play through easy, medium and difficult puzzles, or learn how to play. You are penalized with time for any mistakes you make in easy and medium modes. In difficult, your mistakes are not noted at all.

2. Daily Picross - Play a quick set of five Picross puzzles, once a day. Each day, your score is added to a chart, so you can track whether you're improving or getting worse, similar to Brain Age.

3. My Picross - Design your own Picross puzzles by drawing on the grid. When you're done, you can play your puzzles, or send them to others.

4. Competition Picross - Play Picross against others in this mode. You can choose to use single-cart multiplayer, multi-cart multiplayer, or online play via Nintendo Wi-Fi Connection.

You can also download additional puzzle packs for Picross DS by using Nintendo Wi-Fi Connection, including puzzles from Mario's Picross.</desc>

Although only one person needs a Ping Pals cartridge to start the chat, the game uses unlockable clothing and accessories as incentive to purchase their own cartridge and chat away.  Got no friends?  Ping Pals can even simulate chat with a simple AI chatbot.

Players can purchase items from a store using coins or trade for them with other players. Coins are earned in various ways, including receiving a daily allowance, chatting for a long time, typing special predetermined keywords, and playing minigames.</desc>

Alfonso's retired, but he's called in his kids Junior and Fawcett to fix up the island, and maybe learn a few things about plumbing along the way.

Gameplay is similar to the classic Pipe Dream/Pipe Mania, but with a more mission-based structure, and more unusual modes. Missions can be replayed to get a higher grade, and high grades can unlock various treasures, such as movies, character bios, and new game modes. Pipe Mania even has a multiplayer mode; compete against a friend for points, or use your attacks to damage your opponent's pipes.</desc>

	<desc>Take on the world in Planet Puzzle League, a simple but addictive puzzle game that you may recognize as Tetris Attack, Panel De Pon, or Pokémon Puzzle League.  Colored tiles rise up from a bin, and its your job to arrange them horizontally or vertically in lines of three or more of the same tile.  This causes them to disappear.  Advanced players will be able to arrange tiles so that when they land, they clear additional tiles to stop the tiles from rising and score even more points!

Planet Puzzle League features a wide variety of different game modes to keep even the most dedicated puzzler busy:

1. Endless - Play forever until you fail. The tiles rise faster over time.
2. Clear - Remove all the blocks down to the 'CLEAR' line, buried deep down.
3. Garbage Challenge - Garbage blocks rain down on your bin - clear as many as you can!
4. Vs. COM - Play against the CPU. Try to get their tiles to reach the top of the bin first!
5. Time Attack - See how many points you can earn in two minutes.
6. Puzzle - Either clear the preset mind-bending puzzles, or try the various missions that you are given.

Similar to Brain Age, Planet Puzzle League features a 'Daily' Mode. Play these short games once a day to track your skill over a long period of time. Are you getting better? Or worse?

You can also play multiplayer modes of the game, either locally, or over Nintendo Wi-Fi Connection. Modes of play include Birthday Battle (play against people who share your date of birth), Free Play Battle (play an unranked match), and Friend Battle (play against Friends you've traded Friend Codes with).</desc>

	<path>./Platinum Sudoku (USA) (En,Fr,Es).zip</path>
	<desc>Platinum Sudoku offers 20 million Sudoku puzzles (in five levels of difficulty), over 300 Kakuro puzzles and a number of mini-games. The game starts with a tutorial mode and the twenty million puzzles will only be available to you after completing 100 puzzles in Easy, Medium or Hard mode. Solving all puzzles in Hard mode unlocks the Pro mode, solving the Pro puzzles unlocks the Sudoku X mode. New background graphics, fonts, grid styles and music are also unlockable.

The object of Sudoku is to fill a square grid measuring 9x9 spaces, further divided into nine 3x3 squares with the numbers 1 to 9. Each horizontal row and each vertical column can only contain each number once, and this also applies to each of the square grids. Each grid already contains a few numbers, how many depends on the level of difficulty. The game layout can be switched around for left-handed players by choosing an option from the menu.

Filling the grid is done by either drawing the desired character directly onto the grid on the Touch Screen, by pointing to that number on a small grid or by using the D-pad. Several numbers can be entered in one cell in Draft mode. When the player has deduced which number is the only one possible, the choice is made definitive. It is possible to ask for hints, but these cost "coins" that have to be earned by solving puzzles. Hint A gives some possible numbers for the current cell, Hint B provides the correct number for the current cell, and Hint C scans the whole board and marks cells as right or wrong. It is also possible to choose several assisting features from the game menu, for instance highlighting the current row or column, highlighting the "easiest to solve" cells or automatically filling the grid with all possibilities for each cell.

Kakuro puzzles are like crosswords except the grids are filled with numbers. The grid consists of black and white cells. The white cells must be filled with numbers, the black cells contain the clues. Each entry can only contain a number (between 0 and 9) once and the sum of the numbers must match the clue. For example if the clue is "11" and the entry is three cells wide, the solution could be "1, 6, 4" or "2, 5, 4" but not "2, 7, 2". 

The mini-games included in Platinum Sudoku are Subtract (drop numbers unto others to subtract them until you reach zero), Pair Match (draw lines between pairs of numbers), Shuffle (slider puzzle), Choice Block (find the missing number), High Sum (choose the block with the highest sum) and Mine Detector (mine sweeper). If a challenge is met, the game is unlocked in the menu and you can try to improve your high score.

Two players can play co-op to solve a grid together or compete to see who is the fastest in solving a grid. Finally there is a Custom Grid mode which allows you to design your own puzzles.</desc>

	<path>./Polarium (USA).zip</path>
	<desc>This is a puzzle game similar to Tetris in that blocks fall from above, and to clear the lines before the screen fills up, you must create horizontal lines of all the same color (either black or white).  To change the color (or "polarity") of a block, you must select it with the stylus, then tap it again to make the block flip.  You can also drag the stylus along the screen to change the polarity if many block at the same time.

There is also a puzzle mode where time isn't as critical. Blocks aren't falling, but are just in a certain pattern on the screen. The object is to make the polarity of every block in each horizontal line the same. But the trick is to do the entire screen with one swipe of the stylus. There are 100 puzzles in this mode and they can get very difficult.

The most addicting part of this game is the multiplayer. Utilizing the DS's two screens, you can see your blocks and your opponent's blocks. As you create a horizontal line all of the same polarity, that line is then scrambled and sent to your adversary. The object is to clear your screen before your opponent does. The multiplayer mode does not require 2 Game Cards to play. In fact, when the game is sent over to another DS through the IPL, they don't even need to play multiplayer. The person that received the game can play a simple demo of the game by themselves.</desc>
	<path>./Pony Friends (USA) (En,Fr,De,Es,It,Nl) (Rev 1).zip</path>
	<desc>At the beginning of Pony Friends, the player has the choice to buy a pre-defined pony or create his one from scratch by choosing from a variety of different colors and patterns for each of the four parts (body, legs, face and hair).

Once a pony has been created and named, the player has to care for it by feeding or brushing it in order to keep it's values from decreasing. Depending on how good the values and how well the pony has been treated, it will react differently to the players hand (the stylus). A new pony for example will be afraid at first and will run away when the player makes sudden movements.

Besides caring for your pony, outfitting it with accessories or giving it small treats like apples, you can also do racing events, trail riding or let it perform tricks. While the player can't control the horse itself in the racing events, he needs to cheer it on through the microphone to keep it going. But if the player shouts too loud or not loud enough, the pony will slow down.

During trail riding the player can instead pet the pony or order it to gallop through the forest to train it. While the pony rides on the trail, the player can look around and can each day fulfill a quest by photographing specific animals around the trail by touching them with the stylus. There are also hidden gates which open up additional trails if found and touched.

Tricks are performed by the pony if it's out on the field. Depending on it's condition and on how many awards the player has already earned with the pony, the trick will be more difficult.</desc>

	<desc>After hearing about a strange inheritance dispute in the town of St. Mystere, Professor Layton and his young apprentice, Luke, travel there on behalf of Lady Dahlia, who has requested their presence to resolve the issue.  However, it quickly becomes apparent that St. Mystere is quite strange... all the townsfolk seem to be obsessed with puzzles, and Baron Reinhold's fortune isn't the only secret that the town has hidden...

Professor Layton and the Curious Village is a puzzle game which uses the works of Akira Tago, author of the Japanese series of Head Gymnastics books as its basis. As both Layton and Luke, players explore the town of St. Mystere screen by screen. Each screen contains puzzles, either hidden in the scenery or by talking to characters. Upon finding a puzzle, the screen changes and the player is presented with the puzzle itself: the description of the puzzle on the top screen, and the puzzle (as well as the place to input the answer) on the bottom screen. Some puzzles require simple calculation, some have a trick answer, while others are riddles. The selection of puzzles is quite varied. If the player gets stuck, they can purchase a hint with 'Hint Coins'. However, these are limited - more can be found hidden in the game world, but there a set number of coins in the entire game.

Professor Layton has a visual style similar to that of a watercolor painting. While most of the game does not have much animation, key story sequences are told in fully animated and voice acted scenes. The game also used Nintendo Wi-Fi Connection to connect to the Internet and download additional puzzles for players to solve.</desc>

Naturally our heros, Amitie and her school nemesis Raffine, make their way toward the distant dark castle. Challenging, and being challenged by, everyone you come across in a game of, Puyo Pop!  

A puzzle game of the falling-block variety the goal of which is to clear your blocks (Puyos) by is the combining four or more of the same color which will vanish. This will produce Nuisance Puyos. These colorless Puyos will fall onto you opponents screen, thus blocking chains and combos they could create. These pesky Puyos can only be exterminated by removing neighboring Puyos.

When an opponent send Nuisance Puyos to you screen you can try to "offset" by clearing your own Puyos and limiting the number that would fall on your screen. This will also increase your Fever Meter. When this meter fills you will be given a set of prearranged Puyos with which you can wrack up giant combos and send tons of Nuisance Puyos to you opponent. When any players field becomes so full they can no longer drop Puyos they lose the game.

Puyo Pop Fever features a Two Player Mode. Some versions allow for more people such as the DS version which allows up to eight players to compete in free-for-all or team modes.</desc>
	<path>./Puzzle Chronicles (USA) (En,Fr,Es).zip</path>
	<desc>Puzzle Chronicles is a casual game that combines item-matching puzzling with RPG elements, including character progression and a fantasy story line in the vein of Infinity's earlier titles Puzzle Quest: Challenge of the Warlords and Puzzle Kingdoms.

The puzzle part is played on a board with vertical divider line in the middle. The goal is to push the divider line back to decrease the opponent's territory until no more moves are possible. This is done by matching groups of three gems into like colours along the divider line. These groups fall on the board horizontally. Pushing the divider line back is done by destroying rage gems. There are also special abilities and a sidekick known as a Warbeast that attacks the enemy when a sufficient amount of gems of certain colour has been cleared.

Removing gems also enables the player to collect mana, power spells and items that are then used to attack the opponent and reduce their board space. In addition to the main puzzle game, there are five other mini-games ranging from upgrading the Warbeast companion to crafting new items, while navigating a number of different maps and completing simple quests.</desc>

	<desc>Puzzle Kingdoms is a RPG game using tile matching mini-games as the combat system of the battles, in a similar fashion to Puzzle Quest, another puzzle-based RPG with fantasy themes released in 2007 by the same developers. Instead of swapping adjacent tiles to create groups of three or more like in the earlier title, the main gameplay mechanic this time is to move columns and rows to match tiles.

The player controls a hero character, moving between waypoints in an isometric map similar to the ones found on the Heroes of Might and Magic series. The game is divided in campaigns, where the objective is to invade and defeat all the main cities from a kingdom to conquer it. The hero character levels up automatically after winning a number of battles, adding new abilities and fresh spells to the available arsenal.

The battle screen has a grid of tiles occupying most of the central space, with the troops of the two fighting armies lined up at the sides. Each row and column has buttons to move them, and the combatants take turns trying to make matches of three or more of the same type to charge their troops and increase the damage against the enemy when attacking. When one of the troops is fully charged, an attack button lights up at the top of the screen to unleash an assault against the opposite forces. Attack tiles have a similar effect, starting the maneuver when three or more of them are lined up on the grid.

The troopers have attack and defense statistics that determine the outcome of the attacks, with the alignment with the board colors and terrain effects increasing or decreasing their points. The player can retreat, a useful strategy when the battle is practically lost, allowing the remaining troops to be saved. There are four slots below the troop lines for spells, that can be used to change the number of specific tiles on the grid, alter statistics and help in other ways. They are charged by making matches with tiles of their colors.

New troops can be recruited on the outposts, with money received after winning the battles. Shrines, taverns, dungeons and other special buildings have mini-games, with multiple goals like clearing the grid on a set number of turns, making a series of matches within a time limit and other similar challenges. Completing these bonus stages gives new items and upgrades.</desc>

	<desc>Puzzler Collection is a collection of thousands of puzzles in four categories: Fitword, Crossword, Sudoku and Wordsearch. In Fitword, the words shown must be placed in a grid. In Crossword, clues are given and the player must input the word that matches the description. In Sudoku, numbers are placed in a grid in such a way that no duplicates occur horizontally and vertically. In Wordsearch, the words shown have to be crossed out in a grid of letters. 

There are several game modes and difficulty levels to choose from. The Nintendo DS is held like a book during gameplay, and the player can either play lefthanded or righthanded (which determines on which side the player holds the Touch Screen).

The game has five game modes which include:

1. Simply Puzzle, this lets the player pick any type of puzzle for a quick challenge without keeping score.
2. Quick Blast, which offers a number of puzzles based on the amount of time the player has. This can be set to show up daily, for instance for a daily bus trip.
3. Fast &amp; Fun, which adds a timer to increase pressure on the player.
4. Head to Head, a two-player challenge.
5. Tournament, in which the player solves a series of puzzles increasing in difficulty from Easy to Pro.

In the European version, all puzzles are localized.</desc>

	<desc>Bubby and Bobby return in this Nintendo DS update to the popular arcade game, Rainbow Islands.  The game takes place several years after Bubble Bobble, and the brothers now have the ability to create rainbows to destroy their enemies.  However, they'll need this ability, as the residents of the seven Rainbow Islands have been imprisoned, and need to be rescued!

The DS version of Rainbow Islands functions differently from the original. Your character is now floating inside a bubble on the touch screen, and the levels can be seen both on the top and touch screens. You can drag your character around the screen by touching them with the stylus, or you can drag the stylus elsewhere on-screen to create a rainbow. If you tap a drawn rainbow, it will fall down vertically, killing any enemies underneath.

Finally, there are two special rainbows that can be drawn if you hold the L or R buttons, each with their own special function. Drawing a circle will create a large bubble which you can drag around the screen and hit other enemies with; while drawing a triangle will create a kind of black hole that will suck in enemies, allowing you to take them out in one go. Lastly, there is a special rainbow that can only be drawn when your 'Star Gauge' is full: when it is, this gauge can be tapped, and the player is given a short time to draw a five-pointed star (similar to the 'Healing Touch' in Trauma Center). If successful, all enemies on both screens will be destroyed.

In addition to this new style of play, there is also a 'Score Mode'. In this mode, you only have one life, and must earn as many points as possible as a barrage of enemies continues to attack you. The game also has two secret characters to unlock, as well as a Versus Mode where players compete to reach the top of the level first. The special rainbows are not available in either of these modes.</desc>

	<desc>Red Bull BC One is a Nintendo DS game based on a break dancing competition with the same name. It's a mix of a rhythm action game and a puzzle game where players get to compete against different break dancers from around the world.

Before starting the game players gets to design their own dancer. This is done in the dressing room where the players can customize their characters in different categories. It's possible to choose different body styles, hairstyles and clothing. Playing the career mode will let players unlock more clothing that their character can use. 

The actual gameplay consists of performing different dance moves. These moves are shown on the top screen and are done by playing a simple connect the dots puzzle game on the lower screen. Dots of different colour are shown across the screen and the player has to create shapes by connecting at least three dots of the same colour using the stylus. For each turn the player need to create as many shapes as possible before the time runs out. There is also special star shaped dots. If these are included in a shape the player will perform special moves and gain more points. It's also possible to create perfects, which is the largest possible shape of the turn. By creating multiple perfects the player will gain multipliers that will multiply the overall score. 

There's a couple of game modes. The main one is the career mode where players get to battle against different b-boys with the goal to reach the final of the Red Bull BC One competition. There's also the free mode where players can improve their scores of a specific battle. The game also has a multiplayer mode where players can compete against friends in a one-on-one battle via multi card play.</desc>

	<desc>Arino wants to be the greatest gamer in the world, but he's continually defeated by his friends at every new game that comes out. His obsession has spawned a digital version himself within his own Nintendo DS. This digital version of himself has come to be known as "Game Master Arino", who haunts gamers around the world with retro game challenges. You have been chosen by Game Master Arino, and are now trapped in the 1980s until you can defeat his game challenges.

Retro Game Challenge, based on the Japanese TV show Game Center CX, has you playing faithfully-recreated clones of popular NES-era games, attempting to complete challenges and freeing yourself from Game Master Arino. You are accompanied by Arino himself as a young lad, who will cheer you on as you're playing each game. You can also read the latest gaming mags for tips, cheats, and previews of upcoming titles.

There are eight games total, each modeled after 8-bit classics such as Galaga (Cosmic Gate), Dragon Warrior (Gaudia Quest), and Ninja Jajamaru-kun (Robot Ninja Haggle Man). Each game has multiple challenges from Arino to complete, such as clearing a certain stage or earning a set number of points, and can also be played in a free play mode once all challenges have been cleared.</desc>

All games are based around the simple motions of tapping, sliding and flicking the stylus.

As each game varies from each other, at the start of each game, you're given a brief tutorial to get the hang of how the game you'll be playing works. Tasks for games include (but are not limited to) flicking to construct machinery, releasing the stylus at the right time to belt out a loud note, sliding to rub a lizard's tail in time to a mating dance beat, tapping to gulp down dumplings, tapping and flicking to harvest vegetables and get rid of moles, and more. After every four games, a special "remix" game appears, which combines the previous games into a hectic mix, where you never know what will be up next.</desc>

The Touch Screen on the Nintendo DS is put to use all throughout the game, including navigation through every menu and even a revolutionary new control where the player steers the steering wheel with the stylus or thumb ring.

Another addition to the game is the use of the Nintendo DS's Wi-Fi capabilities. Using wireless communication, up to 6 players can race against each other. In fact, up to 6 players can play with a Game Card in only one of the systems. The other 5 players don't even need the game. There will be more items, such as cars, available to play with if all of the systems have a Ridge Racer DS Game Card in though. So there is an advantage to having multiple Game Cards.</desc>

Robots takes players on an adventure to save Robot city. When Rodney Copperbottom travels to Robot City to meet Big Weld, the famous inventor, he finds that something is wrong. Big Weld is missing and the evil Ratchet has taken over Big Weld Industries. With the help of his friends the Rusties, Rodney puts an end to Ratchet's villainous ways and restores order to the city.

Robots uses a unique perspective that combines 2D side-scrolling with 3D views. The game takes the player to locations from the movie like Robot City, Big Weld's Mansion, the Outmode, and Madame Gasket's Chop Shop. Using the invention mode, players build and upgrade Rodney's weapons including the wrench, scrap gun, electro zapper, and magno grenade. With a combination of navigation, jumping, and combat skills, players can make their way though the world of Robots and bring an end to Ratchet's tyranny.

In addition to the main story line, players will find robots in need all over the city. The parts these poor robots are missing can be found hidden in the numerous maps and returning the correct part rewards the player with power-ups and weapon upgrades. All of the maps are interconnected, so players can easily find their way back to a previous area to uncover additional secrets.The maps are connected with a transit ball mini-game, just like the transit system in the movie.

The DS version of the game features a map that can be annotated by the player, a unique 3D version of the transit ball game that utilizes the stylus for control, and 3D menus. In addition to the new features, the DS also includes high resolution maps that include more detail than the GBA version.</desc>

This adds tactical considerations; you can easily attack multiple enemies in a turn, you can run through allies to get bonuses to your attack, and you can attack from the sides or behind to get an advantage.</desc>

However, on this occasion, not only do you have to win her heart, you have to keep a hold of it. Others will attempt to attract her attention, spawning the possibility of love triangles. 

Only your stylus skills will protect your heart and love from the possibility of losing her forever across 35 episodes, where you'll rub, sing, shoot down and battle against the opposition.

There are three modes - Free Mode, where you can play any of the unlocked games regardless of money, Casino Mode, where you play to win certain amounts of money to unlock games, and Wireless Mode, where up to five players can play single card download over local wi-fi. The controls are fully enabled for touch screen play with the stylus.</desc>
	<path>./Sega Superstars Tennis (USA) (En,Fr,De,Es,It).zip</path>
	<desc>Sega's many franchises come together for a tennis tournament spanning the varied worlds created by them in the last twenty years. Sixteen characters over fifteen different Sega game series are represented, as are ten different courts based on those same franchises.

Exhibition and Tournament modes are included in the game. The first is a simple vs mode, whereas the tournament allows the player to unlock new characters and courts over a series of matches and other challenges, all related to tennis but also drawing heavily on the video game represented. Singles and doubles can be played by either humans or AI, with the player being able to choose his or her doubles partner.

Version differences are notable, as the Wii game misses out on online play in exchange for three different control modes utilising the Wii Remote (much like in Wii Sports tennis, the Wii Remote and nunchuck or the Classic Controller. Online play is included in the 360 and PS3 versions.

Each character has a special move to aid them with their tennis match, relating to the character. For example, Beat from Jet Set Radio has a power that allows the ball to grind against the net and shoot off at a random point, making it difficult to return. 

Minigames are included as both one-offs and part of the tournament. These include a Target-hitting game, The House of the Dead zombie killing game (hit moving zombies around a court before the timer runs out), a Space Harrier game, a Puyo Puyo game, a Virtua Cop game and a Samba De Amigo-related game.</desc>

	<path>./Settlers, The (USA) (En,Fr,De,Es,It).zip</path>
	<desc>The Settlers is a remake of The Settlers II: Veni, Vidi, Vici for the Nintendo DS.

The premise of the game is set to ancient Rome, with you taking control of the Romans in the main campaign, or additionally the Vikings, Nubian and Asian empires in Free Play mode.

The game works very differently from most general strategy games. Your goal is to reach the gateway at the end of each map, usually hidden amidst the enemy lines. You must build military buildings to expand your borders that you can reach the resources that are initially out of your reach. Eventually reaching the gateway to proceed onto the next level. Your city needs roads to optimize the trade routes and allow different buildings to get the resources they need for production.

The game is highly based on gathering resources and optimizing the roads to provide maximal resource gathering. In example, you need a woodcutter to provide a sawmill with logs in order for the builders to build new structures and harbors to build ships for your expeditions.

The game is almost a 1:1 recreation of the original Settlers II game, but it adds few new things to the game such as new music and new GUI to support the stylus.</desc>

	<desc>Named after the television boxing program airing on the US Showtime cable network, this game offers a mix of fourteen heavyweights and welterweights and four arenas to fight in (New York, Las Vegas, Los Angeles and Chicago). Basic moves include upper block, body block, dodging left and right, short punches and powered punches (hook, jab, uppercut, bodyshot). While playing, there are a few parameters to take into account. First there is a health meter that recharges when the boxer dodges hits for some time. Punches need to be thrown strategically, as an energy bar determines the effectiveness. Too many punches deplete the bar and the amount also determines if a boxer will be able to get up when knocked down. A round timer and knockdown lights are also shown. At certain times, a power-up indicator will become available. This allows a boxer to charge a heavy punch, but the opponent will have time to react. When the charging takes too long, the punch is lost.

The different game modes (different for heavyweight and welterweight) include:

1. Single Fights (Quick): fight for only one round until one of the boxers is knocked out.

2. Single Fights (Regular): play for 4, 6, 8, 10 or 12 rounds and choose to decide it by a KO, TKO or by points.

3. Points System: after each round each boxer is awarded points based on performance. At the end of a fight, or after a KO or TKO, the player with the most points wins.

4. Belts: series of three (Amateur), four (Contender) or six (Showtime) fights. Each fight lasts four rounds or three minutes and the aim is to win one of the belts.

5. King of the Ring: one boxer takes on all other boxers in his weight division in one long round.

Additional fighters are unlocked by winning competitions. Most of the modes can also be played with two players through a wireless connection (DS).</desc>

Each character has his own special ability, so you need to figure out little puzzles and switch characters in order to continue. 

The game features local multiplayer, allowing up to 3 players to play and each control a different character. Multiplayer gameplay is the same as single-player. The game features 3D graphics and lots of VO.</desc>

As the Mayor placed in charge of running their own city, players use the touchscreen to build up and run their town, providing commercial, residential and industrial zones, protection against crime and fire, entertainment areas and even airports, highways and railways for the SimCitizens to travel.

Players also have to contend with natural (and unnatural) disasters, the pressures of an ever-expanding city, and of course, public opinion, which can make a job very difficult if things get out of control.

New to this version is the inclusion of wireless communication with other Mayors via a Post Office. Players can send letters to each other, giving a short summary of the state of their city. When players send letters to each other, they earn special monuments for their cities. Additionally, when disaster strikes, the Mayor can take a more hands-on approach in directly rescuing their SimCitizens.</desc>

	<desc>Sonic's first outing on the Nintendo DS system features action in two screens with a story featuring Sonic getting involved in another one of Dr. Eggman's evil plots. A mysterious Emerald is left behind by Dr. Eggman, but an unfamiliar character makes off with it before Sonic can investigate! Sonic gives chase, and thus the adventure begins.

Playable characters in the game are Sonic the Hedgehog and new character Blaze the Cat. Appearances from other character include Miles "Tails" Prower, Amy Rose, Cream the Rabbit, and Knuckles the Echidna. Each playable character has four moves as well as a variety of "Trick actions" which, when performed, will raise your Tension Gauge. Filling the gauge allows you to do a Boost which will propel Sonic or Blaze at a high speed across the ground or along the air to defeat enemies or move certain blocks.

There are 14 levels that play out over both the top and bottom DS screens, giving you a bigger view of your surroundings. You will race through the levels collecting rings, using "gimmicks" such as bungee ropes and giant waterwheels, performing tricks, collecting power-ups, and defeating enemies. When you beat each level, or "act", you will face a Boss Act which is played out over the top screen in 3D. In addition to these levels, there are Special Stages. These are played on the touch screen, and unlike the rest of the game, feature control with the stylus.

Upon completion of the game, Time Attack mode will be available. In it, you play levels/boss acts for the best time record. Battle Play is a multiplayer mode in which two players compete to finish a level first. It can be played over single-card download or multi-card wireless.</desc>
	<path>./Sonic Rush Adventure (USA) (En,Ja,Fr,De,Es,It).zip</path>
	<desc>While flying in their plane across the ocean, looking for a strange energy source, Sonic and Tails' plane is struck by lightning!  They plunge into the murky depths of the ocean...and awaken on a small island.  A local, a raccoon named Marine, informs them that they are on Southern Island.  With Marine and Tails' help, Sonic sets about to explore the nearby islands.

Sonic Rush Adventure is a side-scrolling adventure game, and the sequel to Sonic Rush. Sonic's goal through these platform levels is to zip through as quickly as possible. By pressing the B Button while in the air, Sonic can increase his Tension Gauge by performing aerial tricks. Pressing Y uses a Super Boost, which will allow him to plow through anything in his path at amazing speed, but drains the Tension Gauge.

When Sonic reaches the treasure chest at the end of each level, he will be given a material that can be used for construction of ships and other devices. At first, Sonic is stranded on Southern Island, but after the construction of the waterbike, he can travel to other islands and explore them. Similar to The Legend of Zelda: Phantom Hourglass, the player must plot a path to the next island using the stylus, and then provide limited control over the ship as it travels. However, Sonic has different ships, each of which are notably different from Link's steamboat.

Sonic Rush Adventure also features a Battle Mode, where players can either play locally with a friend, or across the world through Nintendo Wi-Fi Connection. Players can take each other on in a one-on-one race through various levels as each player aims to get to the end first.</desc>

	<path>./Soul Bubbles (USA) (En,Fr,De,Es,It).zip</path>
	<desc>Soul Bubbles is very similar to Bubble Ghost and requires the player to save lost Spirits by transporting them in bubbles to the exit of each level.

The player takes over the role of a Spirit Herder who is tasked with ferrying souls to the underworld. To move the Spirits and keep them relatively save, they need to be be enclosed in soup bubbles. The Spirit Herder then can blow those bubbles through the level, deflate them if they are too big and even cut them into two bubbles and rejoin them later when required. If a bubble bursts, the Spirit will slowly suffocate and eventually die if the player can't draw a new bubble around it fast enough.

But the way to the Gateway Cube isn't an easy one and it's not just as simple as blowing the bubbles from start to finish in the 40 levels. Besides the natural dangers in form of rocks, plants or hungry critters that all destroy the bubble, there are also environment puzzles waiting to be solved like activating a switch which requires a big bubble. There is also Star Dust and so-called Calabash waiting to be collected. While the Star Dust will increase the light emitted by the Spirits and can be collected by simply drawing a new bubble around it, the Calabashs are well hidden but once the player found them all, he will unlock the eighth World called Agartha, the Land of the Dead.

To help with the search, the Spirits will change their shape to heart if a Calabash is near or turn into yellow triangles if there is imminent danger.</desc>

Taking a cue from other recent arcade classic updates, Space Invaders Extreme takes the gameplay of the 1978 classic, and reinvents it, giving power-up blasters, boss aliens, and an electronic soundtrack that plays in sync with the onscreen action.

Basic gameplay remains the same: Players guide a ground based cannon either left or right, blasting an oncoming fleet of invaders before they reach the ground. The main objective is to get as many points as possible before running out of lives.

Space Invaders Extreme introduces new elements, such as invader fleets that break pattern from their left to right descent, boss aliens that require several hits to destroy, power-ups that enhance the cannon, allowing the player to wipe out multiple invaders at once, while racking up combos.

Wi-Fi play is also possible, allowing player to team up cooperatively, or compete against the other. The Nintendo DS version also has a feature for online ranking.</desc>

The touch screen of the DS comes in handy to select new special weapons which can be used in the heat of battle to turn the tide.</desc>

The Krawl are an alien lifeform who consume whole planets, and they have already been spotted in this part of the galaxy. 

Fortunately, there is a way to defeat them. This requires the help of an extinct lifeform called Spectrobes. Rallen and Jeena must visit planets to find fossils of these Spectrobes, excavate, awaken and train them. There are almost 500 different ones for the player to collect and trade. To excavate a Spectrobe, the player must first locate it using another Spectrobe. Using the stylus on the touch-screen, one can carefully remove layers of rock and soil to dig up the fossil, without damaging it. 

The fossil must then be taken back to the space ship, put in a machine and awakened by using your voice or blowing in the microphone. The soil also contains various crystals and minerals, which can be used to feed and train the Spectrobes. They will evolve to stronger and more effective stages. 

The Krawl are on the planets in the form of vortexes. Walking too close to them triggers a battle, in which two Spectrobes join Rallen against the enemy. With a combination of buttons and shoulderbuttons the Spectrobes can unleash special attack powers or combine their respective attacks in real time action.

Via WiFi and on a dedicated website players can battle against each other or exchange Spectrobes and items. Special collectibles can be downloaded. Items and Spectrobes can also be added to the game using game cards with holes through which the touch-screen must be touched in a specific order.</desc>

	<desc>A pseudo 3D (game is played on a 2D plane, but the stages will rotate around Spider-Man at certain points) beat-em-up/adventure game. Vicarious Visions' first title on the Nintendo DS, the game puts the player into the role of Peter Parker (AKA Spider-Man) playing through various missions with varying objectives and pitting him against the likes of Mysterio, The Vulture, and the main villain, Doctor Octavius. The missions themselves vary from missions requiring you to find all hostages to bomb defusal missions and fast paced boss battles.</desc>

	<desc>Based off the 2007 movie of the same name, Spider-Man 3 puts players in charge of the titular hero as he tries to once again New York City safe from the combined menace of the New Goblin, the Sandman, and Venom.

This version of the game is a 2D side-scrolling platformer with 3D stylized elements. The action is primarily controlled using the touch screen. Players use the stylus for combat, webbing, and item interaction. The game also allows for players to adventure in storylines not explored in the third film, such as facing familiar Spider-Man villains from the comic book mythos.

One of the main focal points of the new game is the inclusion of Spider-Man's black symbiote costume. When Spider-Man's "Rage" meter builds up, the black suit automatically takes over, allowing Spider-Man to become faster, aggressive, and more powerful.</desc>

The single player mode is split into thirty map-based combat and Battle combat missions. During map mode you control your Arwings with the stylus. During combat, you move your Arwing by sliding your stylus to the left/right. Bombs are controlled with the touch screen. You may fire the cannons with any button but Start/Select.

Star Fox Command's six-player Wi-Fi mode plays like the Shine Runner mode from Mario Kart DS and the Star Fox 64 multiplayer game. You shoot your friends down for stars.

Star Fox Command has new pilots (Octoman is one of the CPU pilots) and ships, multiple endings, and a new gibberish generator (make your own pilot noises). It also has support for the brand new DS rumble pak.</desc>

Equally startling is the deadly booby trap she triggers in the process of opening a locked door. She barely outruns the giant boulder bearing down on her, escaping the palace only to fall into a surging river, unconscious. The fairy Kukri, imprisoned for centuries in the chamber Anise inadvertently unlocked, rescues her and takes her to the Castle of Albyon. Anise awakens in the presence of the King, whose son is being held by demons in the very palace Anise narrowly escaped from. Recent events have unshakably convinced the King that this thief is descended from the Legendary Hero of Albyon, he who slew the Ancient Demon King centuries ago, and so he commands her thusly: free the Prince from the vile demons... or be tried and convicted as a thief and locked away for life.</desc>

	<desc>The third game in the Collapse! series has the same core gameplay as previous games but features several new modes including for the first time a quest mode. The following eight game modes are available: 

1. Classic

Quest

Relapse

Strategy

Puzzle

Slider

Continuous

Countdown

Initially, only classic and quest modes are available. The rest can be unlocked by playing the quest mode. The classic mode works in the same way as in previous games. The player is presented with a grid that is partially filled with coloured blocks. More blocks are added to grid, one row at a time, from the bottom of the grid. The aim of the game is to remove these blocks before they reach the top of the screen. To remove blocks the player simply clicks a group of three or more like coloured blocks. Some special pieces exists such as bombs that blows up surrounding blocks.

In the quest mode the player enters a strange world where he progresses from level to level. For each level that is completed a new is made available. The quest mode features a store where the player can purchase different things for the money he earns for completing each level. For more money it's also play different casino mini games such as slot machines. All of the game modes are available in the quest mode and after a number of them have been completed they become unlocked for the player to play at any time. 

The relapse mode works like classic but new blocks come in from both top and bottom. In the strategy mode new block will only come in when the player clicks. In the puzzle mode the player has to clear all blocks from the screen and no new appear. In the slider mode the rows of blocks will slide left and right so that the groups changes. The continuous mode is an endless variant of the classic mode and the player has to last as long as possible. In the countdown mode the player has to score as many points as possible in two minutes.</desc>

	<desc>Super Dodgeball Brawlers is a remake of the classic dodgeball sports NES title with characters that resembles those from River City Ransom and Double Dragon.

The original mode still exists, but now has new rules that allow punching, kicking and using weapons against the opposing team. There is a create-a-character option as well.

There are also over a hundred special attacks that can be used against opponents such as Cactus Attack, Panda Shot and Spear to name a few. The new Super Gauge System, when filled, can be given to a player on the court to boosts stats or unleash an "Instant Kill" against an opponent.

Friends can go head-to-head against a friend or even join up against eight people using Wi-Fi.</desc>

	<desc>Based on the movie of the same name, Superman Returns puts you behind the cape of the man of steel as he returns to the earth after his exile in outer space.

Your main objective is to protect Metropolis from the attacks of several enemies ripped right from Superman's comics.
The main campaign gives you a hexagonal map of Metropolis which pinpoints your location as well as your current enemy's location and any disaster areas he may have caused. Since Superman himself is invulnerable, Metropolis itself has a health bar that keeps track of just how much damage the city is enduring, and which measures your level of success/failure.Your objective thus is to move around the map each turn to try and take control of each disaster area which triggers a timed 3rd person perspective sequence in which you control Superman as he flies through the city and uses his powers to solve whatever task is at hand (blowing out fires with his super-breath, destroying mind-control beacons with his heat vision, saving people, etc. etc.) catching up with your enemies triggers a fight sequence in which you must input the correct button-presses on cue to defeat your opponents. In between these rounds story segments that follow the movie's plot play out, which involve a unique 3D action sequence that mimics the movie's counterpart.

Features a single-player campaign as well as two wireless multiplayer modes in which you can face-off against four other Supermen in unique disaster areas to see who gets to clear the objectives faster than the rest. Also includes a gallery of Superman comic covers that are unlocked by collecting Krypton crystals in the game.</desc>

	<path>./Tetris DS (USA).zip</path>
	<desc>At its base, Tetris DS is the same Tetris gameplay that's been around for years: rotate and arrange Tetriminos to create full lines and make them disappear.  However, it also has a style very different from earlier Tetris games, new play modes, and online play.

Graphically and aurally, Tetris DS is based on classic NES games. A portion of the graphics are sprites directly ripped from Mario Bros., Super Mario Bros., Super Mario Bros. 3, Donkey Kong, Balloon Fight, Metroid, Yoshi's Cookie, and The Legend of Zelda. Remixes of music from these games are also used.

Standard mode includes the standard endless play option, the standard "get 25 lines to win" option, and the standard versus mode where clearing multiple lines at once adds lines to the bottom of your opponents' well.

Push mode is a versus game with a twist. The player's moves and pieces are shown on the top screen, while the opponent's are on the bottom screen, both with gravity moving towards the center. Instead of multiple line clears adding extra lines to the bottom of your opponent's well, though, the center is pushed towards their end, giving them a smaller play area. Push back and forth until one side loses.

Touch mode presents you with a tall uneven stack of large Tetriminos. The goal is to nudge or rotate them by dragging or tapping on the touch screen to create full lines and eventually clear the stack.

Puzzle mode offers 200 Tetris scenarios and presents you with a number of pieces. You choose the order and rotation of the pieces to try and empty the well.

Mission mode gives you specific goals like "Use a square block to clear a line" or "Clear 3 lines with an L piece". Finish the mission and you'll be given another. Don't finish the mission and several rows of random blocks will be added to the bottom of the well before being given another mission.

Catch mode has the Tetriminos falling without direct player control. Instead, the player controls a moving core of blocks which can rotate as a whole, as well as latch on to the falling Tetriminos. The goal is to create a square of at least 4x4, causing an explosion which keeps the size of your core small. Lose by allowing your core to get too large, or by losing enough energy; which occurs when you allow a Tetrimino to scroll past the bottom of the screen, your rotating core smacks into and destroys a Tetrimino, or you hit a falling enemy.

Multiplayer Standard, Mission, and Push modes can be played locally using one copy of Tetris DS. Mission allows for up to 10 players competing for a high score. Standard allows for up to 10 players, and has an option for Mario Kart-like items to aid you or harm your enemies. Push mode remains a one-on-one experience. With Nintendo Wi-Fi Connection, you can play a two-player Standard game without items, a four-player Standard game with items, or a two-player Push mode game.</desc>

	<desc>Dominating the exciting world of Theme Park ownership is your goal in this strategy game from Bullfrog. The first task is to set up your rides within the available land, structuring convenient paths and queues and ideally leaving some space for bigger rides once they become available, and include some lakes and trees to increase the park's allure. Rides range from Teacups and Haunted Houses to the biggest most elaborate roller-coaster you can design, and water rides that loop around other rides.

Shops must also be included, so that the visitors can buy food, drinks and souvenirs - the cunning player will combine salt, sugar and caffeine settings to maximize consumer interest. Staff must be hired to keep everything running smoothly, and they will only work for what they consider a fair rate of pay.

You are competing against other Theme Parks, so don't let them get an advantage over you - monitor your success in attracting customers and financial viability closely using the supplied statistics pages. More important, ensure that research is adequately funded to produce new rides.

It can be played in three modes - Sandbox level lets you concentrate on the park design elements, while Sim and Full add more strategic features.</desc>

	<desc>Tiger Woods PGA Tour is the first game in the long running golf series to appear on the Nintendo DS. The game features a Quick Play mode and a Legends Tour mode. In the Quick Play mode the player gets to play single matches either alone or against three opponents. Five authentic courses and one fantasy course are available in the game and the player can choose to play stroke play, match play or skins. The Legends Tour allows the player to take on the best players from around the world. The player starts out on the Rookie Tour but by earning Tour Cards the Pro and Legend Tours are unlocked. By completing events on the tours the player earns cash that can be used to upgrade the golfer's attributes. 

The game features an analog control method using the touch screen of the DS. Before taking the shot the player is presented with a top down of the course that allows the player to adjust his aim. Once that is done two meters appear on the touch screen. One is u-shaped and controls the swing. The power of the shot is determined by how the player draws the stylus on the right side of the meter while the left side determines how straight the shot gets. There is also a boost meter that has to be rubbed repeatedly to add some distance to the shot. Once the ball is in the air the player can influence its rotation by dragging the stylus in the right direction. 

Multiplayer exists for up to four players through wireless communication. All players can play the game simultaneously so no-one has to wait for their turn.</desc>

	<desc>Tiger Woods PGA Tour is the first game in the long running golf series to appear on the Nintendo DS. The game features a Quick Play mode and a Legends Tour mode. In the Quick Play mode the player gets to play single matches either alone or against three opponents. Five authentic courses and one fantasy course are available in the game and the player can choose to play stroke play, match play or skins.

	<path>./Tiger Woods PGA Tour 08 (USA) (En,Fr).zip</path>
	<desc>Tiger Woods PGA Tour 08 is the second game in the series to appear on the Nintendo DS. The game features touch swing controls where the player drags the stylus downwards to backswing and then back upwards again to shoot. A smooth motion leads to a more accurate shot, while the power of the shot is determined by  how long the backswing is and the speed of the motion. At the same time the accuracy of the shot is determined by the angle of the swing. By sliding the stylus right or left, the ball may draw or fade although too much will lead to a hook or a slice. Once the ball is in the air, a close-up image of it appears on the bottom screen. By sliding the stylus repeatedly across the ball, the player is able to make it rotate. 

A more traditional tap control is also available. With it the player swings by pressing a button to begin a backswing. The swing meter bar will then increase until the player presses the button again to decide the power of the shot. After that the player has to press the button a third time to decide the alignment of the shot. 

The game feature a number of game modes. The play now mode allows the player to play a quick match. The player can customize the game by choosing rules (for example stroke play, match play or skins), course and number of holes. The courses are eight in total and include for instance Pebble Beach and St. Andrews. Up to four players can compete in the play now mode and team play is also an option.

The practice mode allows the player to try out the game in his own pace without any opponents or other distractions. In the Tiger Challenge mode the player gets to compete against the best player in the world for a chance to take on Tiger Woods himself. By winning challenges, more are unlocked as progress is made through the game. The player earns money by winning matches and these can be used to upgrade skills. Last, there is the PGA Tour mode where the player goes through a full season of golf with the goal of reaching number one on the ranking.

Multiplayer exist too for up to four players, both locally on one DS, through single or multi card wireless play or online through wi-fi connection.</desc>

	<desc>In Time Ace, the player takes control of an eccentric inventor, Dr. Hugo Clock, in the year 1914 who invents a time machine and travels three years into the future, straight into the first World War.  Upset by witnessing devastation that the first World War will cause, he is determined to stop it at all costs, however, his backstabbing assistant Dr. Klaus Scythe takes the time machine and plans to acquire weapons from the future to rule the world for himself and it is up to Dr. Clock to stop him.

The main idea of the game is to fly in 3-D modeled planes, ranging from World War II fighter planes, to modern day jet fighters and up to space fighters of the future. There are 19 levels to explore, picking up various power-ups scattered throughout the level to upgrade armor, firepower and speed.

There is also multiplayer ability using Wi-Fi where players can dogfight head-to-head in the plane of their choice or four players can play in a variety of minigames like racing.</desc>

Tournament mode builds the players skill by presenting increasingly skilled opponents, while the challenge mode has several challenge games with various rules. These include Pairs, Round the clock and Card 21, where the player has to turn over playing cards by hitting them with the darts. The winner is the closest to 21 with two cards turned.</desc>
	<path>./Touch Detective (USA).zip</path>
	<desc>After young Mackenzie's father died suddenly, she inherited the family detective agency.  Now, with the aid of her robotic butler Cromwell and her short but helpful assistant Funghi, she sets out to earn her reputation as the Touch Detective.  She'll chase down a stolen dream, search for a missing person, and more, as she attempts to become well known for her detecting skills.

Touch Detective is an adventure game in the style of later Sierra adventure games such as Space Quest 6. Players navigate Mackenzie through various screens by touching the area where they want her to move. Mackenzie can interact with certain on-screen objects with another tap of the stylus - depending on the object, she may look at it, pick it up, talk to it (if it can strike up a conversation), or even touch it to see what it feels like. Mackenzie likes to feel objects to understand them, which is why she's the 'Touch' Detective. Mackenzie can also check and combine objects in her inventory.

The top screen of the DS always has a close-up of Mackenzie herself. As she talks to other characters, observes objects and so forth, the top screen will display Mackenzie's thoughts - so while she may say one thing to a person ("Sure, I get it..."), she'll be thinking another ("What was that? I wasn't listening!"). It can be interesting (and sometimes insightful) to see the contrast between what Mackenzie says and what she thinks.

Touch Detective features four different 'cases' for Mackenzie to tackle. After the first case is completed, players can also choose to take on the Bonus Case. In this case, there is no main story, but Mackenzie can choose to take on small requests from characters, as well as increase her Touch List, which records the feeling of particular objects in the game world.</desc>

	<path>./Whac-A-Mole (USA).zip</path>
	<desc>This is an adaption of the arcade game Whac-A-Mole, for Nintendo's handheld devices. At the screen you have a 5x4 grid of holes (3x3 in the GBA version). As the game begins, moles will randomly pop up their heads in the holes. Now you have to hit them before they disappear again. DS users will use the stylus and tap the moles, while GBA users will have to use the directional pad to move a marker around the screen.

The game comes with three different game modes. The first is the arcade mode, were you for each level has to reach a certain amount of points before the time goes out. Different types of mole will show up. In addition to the standard mole, there's the golden mole which gives four times as much points as the standard one, and the plush one which gives minus points. Later in the game, you will also meet moles that attack your score, for example ninja and bazooka moles. Various power ups are also available. We have the multipliers, which once active will give you double points for each mole, clocks that slows the time and bombs that do the opposite. Seven worlds are available, each with it's own graphical theme.

The second mode is the puzzle mode, which isn't the same on both platforms. In the DS version you have to recreate a shape that is shown on the upper screen. This is done by tapping moles of different colors. The GBA version has two puzzle games. One is a Tic Tac Toe where you have to hit three moles in a row before your opponent does so. The other is the Peg Puzzle where you have to empty the field from all moles. For each mole you remove, more moles will appear on the screen. The moles will have arrows around them, indicating where the new moles will pop up. However, there won't come any new moles if there already is a mole in that location.

The third mode is a simple quick play mode where you just specify how many levels you want to play and with what difficulty and then try to be successful. The DS version also supports a multiplayer mode.</desc>

	<desc>Based on the Cartoon Network series, Xiaolin Showdown for the Nintendo DS is an isometric beat 'em up that takes you around the world, from the Xiaolin Temple and the streets of Tokyo to Jack Spicer's secret laboratory and the inside of a dragon's stomach.

Playing as any of the four trainee monks from the TV show (Omi, Clay, Kimiko and Raimundo), it's up to you to recover the mystical Shen Gong Wu by defeating the likes of Jack Spicer, Panda Bubba and Chase Young in wacky Xiaolin Showdown mini-games. But to reach the villains, first you'll need to battle your way through their henchmen, from robot cheerleaders and zombie construction workers to tigers and tuxedo-wearing gangsters.

Adding to the replayability, each of the four monks has his or her own unique moves and special elemental attacks, which you can unlock as you play through the game. You can also use the weird and wonderful powers of the Shen Gong Wu that you collect to aid you in your quest, including the Two Ton Tunic, the Third Arm Sash and the Star Hanabi.</desc>

	<path>./Zendoku (USA) (En,Fr,De,Es,It).zip</path>
	<desc>Zendoku takes the concept of the puzzle game Sudoku and adds role playing elements to it.

The game replaces the numbers 1 to 9 with nine Martial Arts symbols like a panda or a dragon but the original rules remain in place. This means the player still needs to complete a column, row or 3x3 box were every symbol is only used once. The player can test his skills either in Classic Sudoku or in Zen-Mode where he needs to solve Sudoku puzzles under the pressure of time, but the core of the game is the Quest-Mode. 

At the beginning of the quest the player chooses from eight available characters. Four fight with weapons, four freehand but each one has a different quest, uses different fighting styles and has a different lucky symbol. Kingkage is for example a typical ninja. He uses the Ninjutsu-style, wants to be a legendary fighter and has the panda as his lucky symbol. Once a decision has been made. the player follows the story line of the chosen character on a 2D world map and when a fight occurs, the opponents play a round of Sudoku.

Every time one of the fighters completes a column, row or 3x3 box an attack is launched and obstacles appear on the opponents board while an attack icon travels along a rail towards the attacked. If he now correctly places his lucky symbol on the board, the attack will be reversed back his opponent. Placing a symbol incorrectly will make the player lose health and causes several cells on the opponent's grid to automatically fill in.

The game also features a multiplayer mode for two player in which they can either try to solve a puzzle together or play against each other in a battle.</desc>

	<desc>The zoo animals have revolted against the zoo keeper.  It is your job to restore order and "capture" all of the animals.

In this colorful and fast-paced match-up game, players select animals of the same type using either the touch-screen or a standard controller. Line like animals up in rows by swapping them from spot to spot in the time allowed. 

There are 5 varied game play modes: Normal, Tokoton, Quest, Time Attack and 2P. Normal mode has you clearing a set amount of animals each level before progressing to the next. Tokoton is similar to Normal, but has all the animal amounts set to 100 before you'll level up. Quest has you playing ten set stages with specific goals (such as only capturing animals of a certain type) that you must attempt to achieve. Time Attack has you aiming to get the highest score possible in the time limit. 2P has two players battling it out against each other.</desc>
