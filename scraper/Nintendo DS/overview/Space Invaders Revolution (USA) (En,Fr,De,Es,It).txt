Space Invaders marks a return to the gaming scene with both old and new versions of the classic arcade experience.

Revolution includes the shoot 'em up as it was originally released to arcades and consoles worldwide, as well as an update collection of modes featuring new visual effects and backdrops and harder enemies to defeat. The touch screen of the DS comes in handy to select new special weapons which can be used in the heat of battle to turn the tide.
