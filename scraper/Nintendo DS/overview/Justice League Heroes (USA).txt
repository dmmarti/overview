The DS version on Justice League Heroes, while not following the plot of its console brethren, has a similar premise where you play as a member of the titular super-hero team and travel to a number of locations where hordes of enemies run amok.  The game is played with a top-down view of the environment on the lower screen and a map on top.  The map displays the location of your next checkpoint and the positions of the enemies along with the status of your characters.  The lower screen, in addition to the action, has various function icons that can be activated with the stylus.  There are about a dozen missions broken into about forty sections.  Before each, you must pick two heroes from the line-up of Superman, Batman, Wonder Woman and Flash.  Each has regular melee attacks, strong melee attacks, a ranged attack and a unique super-power move. They must use these abilities to defeat many enemies and move to the next checkpoint, completing objectives such as switch-flipping and item collection along the way.  You may swap between your two heroes at any time by tapping an icon on the screen.  Another icon lets you call in an AI-controlled hero for brief support.  There are six of these to choose from: Martian Manhunter, Zatanna, Green Lantern, Aquaman, Green Arrow and Huntress.  Each of these has a unique ability based on their powers.  In addition to the main game, there are two minigames and a third can be unlocked by inserting Justice League Heroes: The Flash into the GBA slot.
