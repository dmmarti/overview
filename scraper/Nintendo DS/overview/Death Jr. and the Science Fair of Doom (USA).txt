Death Jr. makes his way to the Nintendo DS from his PSP franchise.  The player takes control of Death Jr. and his friend Pandora as they embark on a mission to save their friends Smith and Weston, Stigmartha and Seep from their own creation.  While attending their school's science fair, they accidentally unleash an ancient and evil demon by the name of Moloch who threatens to bring an end to their world.  The player can switch between either D.J. or Pandora, using a plethora of creative weapons like C-4 hamsters, firearms which range from pistols to shotguns as well as D.J.'s trusty scythe to decimate the enemies.  The gameplay consists of using both the stylus to perform touch-screen gestures and pressing regular pad buttons to create a variety of attacks.  There is also multiplayer with two mini-games that can be played between friends.  One of which is Reaper Ricochet where players bounce C-4 hamsters off of tombstones at each other and the other is War Mode where two teams can engage each other in side-scrolling shoot-em up's.
