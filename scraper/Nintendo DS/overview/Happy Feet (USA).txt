Happy Feet is based on Warner Bros' popular movie of the same name. You play Mumble, a young penguin born into a nation of singing Emperor Penguins. Each Penguin needs a Heartsong to attract a soul mate. Unfortunately, Mumble can't sing, but he's a great tap dancer.  The game follows the storyline of the movie through two major alternating gameplay sequences: rhythm-based levels that involve tapping the screen in time with music, and downhill sledding levels, where Mumble races downhill on his belly, picking up items along the way and avoiding obstacles.
