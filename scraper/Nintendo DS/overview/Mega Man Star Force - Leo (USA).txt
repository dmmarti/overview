Mega Man Star Force introduces a new lead character, a boy named Subaru Hoshikawa, who puts on special "visualizer" goggles left to him by his father, triggering a specific wave and summoning the presence of a mysterious alien life form named Warlock. Dangerous creatures from Warlock's planet have come to attack Earth, so they must join together to transform into Mega Man in order to defeat these menacing forces. Specific to the Leo version - turning up the heat, Fire Leo uses a special Flame Burner attack that can incinerate enemies in its path.
