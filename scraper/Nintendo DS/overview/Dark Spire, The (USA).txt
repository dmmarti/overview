In this throwback to the early days of CRPGs you must explore the Dark Spire dungeon with a party of up to four characters.

Party creation is basic by most modern standards. 
Four races, three alignments, four classes along with five different stat points are all there are to decide what your character is.

These four characters begin the game inexperienced and weak like almost every RPG. They gain skills, power and better quality items as they progress through the various dungeons.

Experience points are spent on skills for the characters, some of these opening the choice to upgrade one of the 4 basic classes to become a different prestige class, offering different abilities.

The game is played without use of the touchscreen and only uses the direction pad and buttons. The top screen displays the party location in 3d and the bottom screen has info on their status.
