Mechanic Master 2 offers an exciting new gameplay feature for this crazy puzzler: disassemble objects to create hybrid gadgets. Players are challenged by 110 new levels, and must use dozens of new objects (60+ in total) to make things work out. New drawable shapes in Drawing Mode include the magnet, ball and black hole. There's also a built-in level editor, and you can share your levels with friends via a local wireless connection.
