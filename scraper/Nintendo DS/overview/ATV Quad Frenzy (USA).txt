ATV Quad Frenzy is a 3D ATV off-road racing game.  It focuses largely on the handling of the vehicles and the way they reacts to the bumps of the track.  This means paying attention to the suspension and it also means big air, where you can perform tricks by selecting a trick with the select button, then holding the A and B buttons.  There are a variety of ATVs and five modes to choose from.  The modes are practice, quick race, championship race circuit, championship pro circuit and a multiplayer head-to-head mode.  The game includes a virtual garage in which players can upgrade their ATVs through a touch-screen interface.  Tires, suspension, etc can be replaced.
