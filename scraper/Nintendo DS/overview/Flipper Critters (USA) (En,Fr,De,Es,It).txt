Flipper Critters is set in an imaginary world filled with a variety of remarkable places, from town squares and mountain valleys to towering castles and even the surface of the moon. In this magical world you'll find all of the traditional pinball features, including ramps, sinkholes, bumpers, jackpots, gates and goals - just in a different form than you've ever seen them.
