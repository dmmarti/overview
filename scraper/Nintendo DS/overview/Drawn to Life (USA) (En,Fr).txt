In the beginning, the Creator built the world and left its people, the lighthearted Raposa, his blueprint -- The Book of Life.  It's been nearly a generation since the Raposa have been in contact with the Creator, and most assume he's left them to take care of themselves.  Still, the time has passed peacefully, and the Raposa lived in relative happiness and comfort.  However, the Book of Life has been stolen, and a madman has been reshaping the world according to his own whims.  Most of the Raposa have moved away, looking for safer lands, and those who remain plead for the Creator to return and save them from the darkness, which has crept across their village.    As the Creator, your job is to rebuild your fragmented world, and recover the now missing pages of the Book of Life.  Use your stylus and draw your own hero to platform his way to saving the Raposa's world. Along the way, draw your own platforms, vehicles, and all manner of other things. It's up to you to bring color back into the darkened landscape.  The player's character can be drawn for various elements such as torso, head, arms and legs with different color schemes. In the village shop, games, songs, patterns and moves can be bought to travel through the world with 2D-platformer gameplay.
