Nanostray 2 is similar in gameplay to the original Nanostray, but has a few new features.  You can play over thirty missions with over six different game modes to play in.  You can play the Adventure Mode, which shows cut-scenes to tie into the story or you can skip the story and play Arcade mode and just go for the highest score possible.  You can also play in challenge mode, completing a set of four challenges that unlocks a new simulator mode challenge, which is similar to Arcade mode, but with a different scoring system.  It has sixteen massive bosses and over one hundred different types of enemies and you can change control styles, using the classic or using the left or right handed touch control.  There is also a Nanogauge that fills up when you destroy multiple enemies, earning you bonus multipliers.  You can play against a friend in duel mode or play in cooperative mode using multi-cards and can also upload your high scores online using the Wi-Fi connection.
