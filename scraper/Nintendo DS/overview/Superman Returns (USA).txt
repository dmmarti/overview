Based on the movie of the same name, Superman Returns puts you behind the cape of the man of steel as he returns to the earth after his exile in outer space.

Your main objective is to protect Metropolis from the attacks of several enemies ripped right from Superman's comics.
The main campaign gives you a hexagonal map of Metropolis which pinpoints your location as well as your current enemy's location and any disaster areas he may have caused. Since Superman himself is invulnerable, Metropolis itself has a health bar that keeps track of just how much damage the city is enduring, and which measures your level of success/failure.Your objective thus is to move around the map each turn to try and take control of each disaster area which triggers a timed 3rd person perspective sequence in which you control Superman as he flies through the city and uses his powers to solve whatever task is at hand (blowing out fires with his super-breath, destroying mind-control beacons with his heat vision, saving people, etc. etc.) catching up with your enemies triggers a fight sequence in which you must input the correct button-presses on cue to defeat your opponents. In between these rounds story segments that follow the movie's plot play out, which involve a unique 3D action sequence that mimics the movie's counterpart.

Features a single-player campaign as well as two wireless multiplayer modes in which you can face-off against four other Supermen in unique disaster areas to see who gets to clear the objectives faster than the rest. Also includes a gallery of Superman comic covers that are unlocked by collecting Krypton crystals in the game.
