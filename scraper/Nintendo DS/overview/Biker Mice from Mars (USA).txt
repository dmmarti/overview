Help the Biker Mice From Mars, Vinnie, Modo, and Throttle, in their quest to save planet Mars from destruction with the help of the Regenerator, a machine that can create water for the Martians to continue to survive with.  With the original Regenerator destroyed beyond repair, the trio must head to planet Earth to rescue Stoker, who can help them create another.  Biker Mice From Mars is a hybrid of a racing game, and a side-scrolling beat-em-up.  Take the role of Vinnie, Modo or Throttle, and race against opponents as well as beating them up in your quest to rescue the planet Mars.  During the racing sections of the game, you can fire rockets at your foes (once collected from crates scattered on the track), or boost ahead of opponents.  You're also racing against a time limit, and must make it to the end of the track before time is up.  Destroying enemies will add precious seconds to your timer.  The beat-em-up sections are fairly straightforward.  You walk to the end of each stage, beating up opponents with punches and kicks as you progress.  The screen locks into place when a group of enemies appear, and you must beat them before you can move on.  The mice can also pick up thrown grenades and throw them back at enemies, as well as climb up and down certain objects to take different paths.
