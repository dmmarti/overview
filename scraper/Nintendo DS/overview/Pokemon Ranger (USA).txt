An action RPG set in the world of the Pokémon Ranger movie. You play as a Pokémon Ranger. Different from a Pokémon Trainer, a Ranger travels the lands, using Pokémon in a fight to defend nature from baddies. Its release precedes that of Diamond and Pearl, and all three games link up together for some top secret bonuses.
