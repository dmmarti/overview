Elite Beat Agents is the spiritual sequel to Osu! Tatakae! Ouendan!  In this rhythm-based music game, the Elite Beat Agents are a special task force dedicated to helping people in need and righting wrongs through the power of song.   The game is played entirely through use of the stylus.  Timing is required to line up the rings that close in on the circles to ensure the proper beat for the song.  Beats can also be scored by dragging a glowing ball through a set line area until the end of a beat.  Finally, players will be required to turn a spinner as quickly as possible during a music break.  The level stories are mostly comedic, where the Agents will help a girl and her jock boyfriend go steady, help a speeding taxi driver deliver a baby, and even help a weather reporter chase away rain clouds to go on a picnic with her son.  Each level is accompanied by popular songs such as Madonna's "Material Girl", Chicago's "You're the Inspiration", or Jamiroquai's "Canned Heat", among others, for 19 music tracks total.  Multiplayer allows gamers to compete against each other via single-card or multi-card play.
