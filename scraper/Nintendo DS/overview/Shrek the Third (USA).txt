Shrek the Third for Nintendo DS is the only Shrek 3 game that does not follow the movie plot. It makes heavy use of the microphone and touchpad to make a unique gaming experience. You can play as Puss in Boots, Prince Artie, and, of course, Shrek. Player controls are almost entirely touch screen based. Each character has his own special ability, so you need to figure out little puzzles and switch characters in order to continue. 

The game features local multiplayer, allowing up to 3 players to play and each control a different character. Multiplayer gameplay is the same as single-player. The game features 3D graphics and lots of VO.
