Prince of Persia has long been remembered for its entertaining platform adventures. But now, for the Nintendo DS, it's moving in a new direction.  Set during the dark times of The Sands of Time and Warrior Within, the Prince must now lead an army to secure peace in his land, through a unique turn-based strategy design. Players collect cards to increase the power of prestige of their troops, which can be traded with other players. Up to three decks can be saved, but you must choose only one to use in battle. From here, you command your forces through the cards to defeat enemies in each battle.
