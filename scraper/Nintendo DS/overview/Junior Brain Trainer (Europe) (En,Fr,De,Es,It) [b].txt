In this version of Brain Training designed for 6-11-year-olds, Junior Brain Trainer gives younger players a chance to practice important key skills in reading, writing, spelling, maths, geometry, logic and problem solving. It takes a different approach to the formula, by delivering information in smaller sessions, making it easier to take in. Gameplay is designed to suit a childs attention span and ensures they are frequently occupied.

Unlockable games include:

1. Ghosts - use the stylus to touch a ghost and capture it. As many as possible must be caught within the time limit.

2. Twins - a memory game requiring pairs of people to be matched up against a time limit.

3. Snakes - a game of skill and timing that requires a snake to be guided around the screen to collect coloured sweets.

4. Football  the stylus is used to move a football boot across the screen kicking a ball against the wall to remove bricks.

5. Beggar My Neighbour  tap on a pile of playing cards with the stylus to play a move against the console. Whoever has the highest card wins the hand.

6. Balloon Pop - the D-pad is used to move a sling shot to the left and right. The A button fires at the balloons and pops them.
