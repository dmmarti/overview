Based off the 2007 movie of the same name, Spider-Man 3 puts players in charge of the titular hero as he tries to once again New York City safe from the combined menace of the New Goblin, the Sandman, and Venom.

This version of the game is a 2D side-scrolling platformer with 3D stylized elements. The action is primarily controlled using the touch screen. Players use the stylus for combat, webbing, and item interaction. The game also allows for players to adventure in storylines not explored in the third film, such as facing familiar Spider-Man villains from the comic book mythos.

One of the main focal points of the new game is the inclusion of Spider-Man's black symbiote costume. When Spider-Man's "Rage" meter builds up, the black suit automatically takes over, allowing Spider-Man to become faster, aggressive, and more powerful.
