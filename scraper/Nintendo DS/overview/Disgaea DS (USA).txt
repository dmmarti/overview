Disgaea DS is a port of the PSP version.  While it still has the same story from its predecessor, it features some tweaked gameplay and interfaces that utilizes the DS' dual-screen and stylus pen.  It features new objects that have been introduced such as Geo Cubes that enchances players abilities as well as summon monsters that can attack opponents.  Demon Gadgets are also present which are randomly scattered throughout battlefields that can level up an unit as much as 30 levels at once.  Classic characters from the original Disgaea and its sequel can also be unlocked along with bosses that can be unlocked and used including Overlord Zetta.  There is also multiplayer capabilities that can allow two human players to play co-op.
