CSI: Dark Motives DS is an adventure/reflexive game, in the pure style of the famous TV series from CBS. It's also the first CSI game to be released on the Nintendo DS.  The game is based on the second PC game, CSI: Dark Motives. You join the Las Vegas Graveyard Shift as a rookie, supervised by Grissom, Willows, Sidle, Brown and Stokes. Your job is to solve five cases. Process the evidence in the lab with Sanders, get warrants from Brass and go to Robbins for some new data. If you're thorough, you will reach the ultimate rank of Expert. And remember, criminals always leave traces and the evidence never lies.  Players can use the stylus for looking around, detecting or collecting evidence, asking questions to suspects or witnesses or even for giving them to Sanders.
