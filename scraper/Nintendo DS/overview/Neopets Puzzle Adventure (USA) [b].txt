Neopets Puzzle Adventure offers players a new take on puzzle adventure games. Choose one of twelve Neopets and challenge your opponents in the land of Neopia in one of several puzzle minigames, including a power-up filled reimagining of the classic games Reversi and Go.  Other minigames include a touchscreen gesture shooting gallery, a memory puzzle, and a colorful brick-breaking game. During the adventure, players acquire new PetPets, unlock over 100 missions, and redeem codes to unlock virtual items at the Neopets website.  Neopets Puzzle Adventure also features head-to-head multiplayer.
