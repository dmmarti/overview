In Drone Tactics, the player is transported to the world of Cimexus, a land inhabited by giant bugs at war with each other.  A deadly army called the Black Swarm is out to destroy the peace-loving bugs of Cimexus and it is up to the player to stop them.  The gameplay is turn-based with an overhead map, moving units around in strategic places with battles scenes being played out and cinematics after each round.  The player has the ability to build their own army with over 100 different weapons, upgrades and power-ups.  There are 50 different maps and players can go head-to-head with each other using local wireless.
