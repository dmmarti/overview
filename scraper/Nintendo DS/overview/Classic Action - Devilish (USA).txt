Devilish is a remake of the original game of the same name. Control two paddles together to move the ball upward through enemies and obstacles and fight the occasional boss.  The game uses the dual-screen capability of the DS to give a greater view of the playfield than the original title offered, though it does not use the touch screen. The game offers three difficulties and progress and records are saves.
