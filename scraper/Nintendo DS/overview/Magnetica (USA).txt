Playing with balls is fun! Magnetica is a fiendish action puzzler game from Japanese developer Mitchell Corporation, and the sequel to the 1998 arcade game Puzz Loop. Marbles will relentlessly roll across twisted tracks and into a hole in its center. When three same-coloured marbles touch each other, they destroy themselves. With the DS Stylus, players must shoot same-coloured marbles into the oncoming rows in order to prevent them from falling down the hole and thus clear a track. The twist is that now, marbles that share the same color will attract each other!

Magnetica takes advantage of the Nintendo DS hardware for precise touch-screen functionality and brings a new play mechanic to the famous puzzle. Test your ball-shooting skills in Challenge Mode, Puzzle Mode, Quest Mode and more.
