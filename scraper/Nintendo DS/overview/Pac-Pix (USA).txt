Pac-Pix originally started as a tech-demo for the Nintendo DS when the DS was first announced. Many people at E3 liked the demo so much that Namco made it a full-fledged game. In this DS exclusive title, Pac-Man has been captured by the ghosts and you must save him. You use the touch-screen to draw Pac-Man and try to eat the ghosts.  There are a few different types of ghosts that require a different strategy for each type.

You have Pinky that just moves around slowly and Blue that will make a quick dash as you approach him. There is Numboos which is multiple ghosts with numbers and you must eat them in order if you wish to defeat them. Bari-Boo has a shield and you can only defeat him by attacking from behind, if you hit his shield in front of him or from the side you just bounce off. There's the ink ghosts which throw ink and then there's the block ghosts which require you to break their defenses with a bomb.

During your adventure you will learn to draw arrows to shoot ghosts and stun them, as well as ghosts that are floating in bubbles. You will also be able to draw bombs to destroy blocks that are in your path. There are many things to do with the touch screen in this game. Pac-Pix is a Pac-Man game like no other before it.
