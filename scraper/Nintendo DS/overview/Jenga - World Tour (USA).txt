Jenga World Tour is a take off of the popular board game in which you take blocks from the lower part of a block tower and set it on top without toppling it.  The premise is the same for the video game, using the Wii remote, you pull the blocks while moving the remote and using "A" button while using the "B" button to tap them out gently to keep the stack from toppling over.  There are several different backgrounds (in the pit of a volcano, medieval England, underwater, prehistoric times or even the Himalayan Mountain) you can play in, each having their own special differences, such as blocks freezing in the Himalayan stage or only being able to hold onto hot blocks in the volcano for a limited time or even avoiding catapults in the England stage.  There is also an arcade mode where you play a continuous game of Jenga or you can play against a friend in multi-player mode.  The Nintendo DS runs along similar lines, using the stylus pen to pull out and tap blocks out of place, but doesn't have the same levels as the Wii version, but does have the same kind of effects (i.e. ice blocks, cement blocks and even UFO attacks).  You can also play against a friend using Wi-Fi.
