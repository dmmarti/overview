For once, Bowser has changed his tactics. Instead of grabbing the Princess every chance he gets, he's gone straight to the source of all his problems this time around. The two people who always get in his way and halt his chances of owning Mushroom Kingdom all himself. Mario and Luigi are suddenly whisked away, and only one person can save them...  Princess Peach, always the one in distress, will use all her unique abilities and items to travel the length of the Kingdom to save her heroes. Her main attack uses a parasol on enemies, which can also double as the perfect way to float down from the heights.   Princess Peachs' emotions will also come into play. Make her cry to drench enemies or help plants grow to reach higher ground, meanwhile her happy singing can distract many foes and open up further areas.
