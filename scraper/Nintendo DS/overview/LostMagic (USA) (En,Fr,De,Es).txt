In Lost Magic the player controls Isaac, a young Wizard who initially sets out looking for his missing father. Soon his investigations uncover a threat to the world by the evil Diva of Twilight.  Lost Magic is a game that where the primary focus is combat, with little in the way of exploration to interrupt the main theme of the game.  The stylus is used to direct the player's allies, (monsters captured by Isaac)and to cast spells.  The focus of the game is capturing monsters to later help the Isaac defeat the more powerful foes. Up to 400 different spells can be cast, many in combination with others to create new effects. The challenge lies in using the stylus quickly and accurately to not only combine these spells, but to effectively direct the real time battles.  The game supports Wi-Fi as well as both single and multi cartridge  versions of multiplayer.
