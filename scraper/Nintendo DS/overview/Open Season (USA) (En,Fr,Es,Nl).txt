Open Season is based on the Sony Pictures Animation's CG animated film of the same name, where a rowdy brood of forest animals turn the tables on a bunch of unsuspecting hunters.    The game is a side-scrolling-puzzle adventure. The plot of the game is to complete puzzles and avoid traps to advance from level to level.  Every level completed will raise your friendship with the different animals of the forest.  Once friends, these animals can be used as allies to attack and defeat the hunters encountered along the way.  Following the plot of the movie, once the player has become friends with a sufficient amount of animals, he can then take on the evil hunter leader Shaw.  The gameplay loop is to find clever ways to solve puzzles that prevent you from moving forward in a level.  To solve these puzzles, the player can switch between the two main characters : Boog, a 900 pound bear and Elliott, a crazy deer.  Both characters have their specific skills which need to be wisely used to progress through the levels.  To solve most of the puzzles, Boog and Elliott, each controlled individually and seperately, will have to work as a team.  To complicate the gameplay a bit, the player will encounter hunters on the way which he can defeat "using" the now friendly skunks, beavers, squirrels...  which all have their unique skills.  This game is a 2,5D side-scrolling game with an emphasis on spatial puzzles. The story mode contains 27 levels. In addition, there's also eight minigames.
