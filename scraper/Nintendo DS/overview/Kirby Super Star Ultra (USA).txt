This game is a toughened up version of Spring Breeze, the opening game.  The Arena: Every boss that Kirby has met throughout the game, one after the other!  Try to beat them all!  Meta Knightmare Ultra: Play through the first five games as Meta Knight, with his own special abilities and powers!  Speed is the key!
