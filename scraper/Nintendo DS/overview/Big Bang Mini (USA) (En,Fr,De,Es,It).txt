In Big Bang Mini, your main objective is to use the stylus to create fireworks and destroy the waves of enemies that loom overhead. If you miss, you'll be forced to tackle another challenge: avoiding the sparks created by your falling fireworks. Celebrate the completion of a level by designing the Final Bouquet, a one-of-a-kind masterpiece that will proclaim your victory.
