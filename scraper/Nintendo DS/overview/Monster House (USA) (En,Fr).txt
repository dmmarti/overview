Monster House is an old-school shoot 'em up based on Columbia Pictures' animated movie of the same name. With the help of your touch screen controlled water gun, you explore the house room by room, fighting off waves of enemies (assorted household objects) coming from every direction. You also pick up various power-ups along the way. You can play as each of the three characters from the film - DJ, Chowder, and Jenny.  This game is heavily inspired by classics like Robotron and Smash TV.
