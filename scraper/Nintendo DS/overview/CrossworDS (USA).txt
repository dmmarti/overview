Take a break with Crosswords DS.  Hold your Nintendo DS like a book, and choose to solve one of the hundreds of crossword puzzles of varying difficulty.  If that's not your thing, you can also choose from word searches or even anagram puzzles.  Crosswords DS uses handwriting detection to let the user input their answer into each crossword puzzle.  Puzzles range from easy to master difficulty, with special 'themed' crosswords becoming unlocked after you solve a page of twenty crosswords.  After you complete a puzzle, you are graded based on how many hints you used, and if you used Entry Assist to help you fill in the crossword.  Your completion time is shown as well.  Word searches display a grid of letters on the touch screen.  Simply drag the stylus across the letters you think form the word, and if you're correct, the word will be marked off the list.  Anagrams gives the player a set of letters - these are used to try and form all the words possible with the combination of letters.  Each time you successfully discover a word, it is filled into your list.
