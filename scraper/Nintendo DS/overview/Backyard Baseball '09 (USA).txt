The first Backyard Baseball to come out on the DS features stylus-friendly controls and takes advantage of the dual screen by including a top-down "radar map" of the field on the top screen.   Like prior games from Humongous Entertainment, Backyard Baseball '09 features a child-version star from each MLB team (including David Ortiz, Derek Jeter, and Ichiro), in addition to the regular cast of Backyard Kids. Players can also create custom teams.   Gameplay modes include Season mode, Pick-up game, Home Run Derby, and Fielder's Challenge.
