Cooking Mama is, as the name implies, a game where you cook!  The player takes orders from various customers and then has to prepare the to fit their order and to satisfy their tastes. The way the meal is prepared is up to the player, and a number of different ingredients are available.  Each preparation section is timed, as well as this, players are marked on the final product.  The touch screen is used to slice and soak vegetables, marinade meat, peel fruit and of course cook it on the stove.  The screen allows for more sensitive and easier interaction allowing a more realistic and hands on cooking experience than a mouse or controller could.
