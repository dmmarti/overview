Nintendo DS racing game from Skyworks Technologies and Majesco. Jump behind the wheel of your favorite monster truck and race on 25 different all-terrain tracks in five different environments. Master eight different monster rides, each with different starting attributes. As you complete challenges, you can upgrade your monster trucks in the performance shops between races with the cash you earn by winning the races. Tear-up the tracks and put it all on the line with your friends via a four-person multiplayer mode.
