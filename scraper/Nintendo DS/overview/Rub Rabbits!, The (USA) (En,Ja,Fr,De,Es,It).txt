The sequel to DS launch title, Feel the Magic. As with the first title, your aim is to guide your lovestruck hero through a number of challenges and puzzles to gain the heart of his true love. However, on this occasion, not only do you have to win her heart, you have to keep a hold of it. Others will attempt to attract her attention, spawning the possibility of love triangles.   Only your stylus skills will protect your heart and love from the possibility of losing her forever across 35 episodes, where you'll rub, sing, shoot down and battle against the opposition. Once you've got the girl, you can also take on your friends in multiplayer modes that range from the straight forward high score mini games to the crazy, such as making babies!
