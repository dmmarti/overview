Brain Buster Puzzle Pak features hundreds of puzzles ranging from the hugely popular Sudoku to the latest craze in Japan, Kakuro. Also included are the uniquely challenging and innovative games Light Up, Nurikabe, and Slitherlink. These puzzles have all been created in conjunction with Nikoli, the leading puzzle creators in Japan. Along with the straightforward puzzles in Brain Buster Puzzle Pak, there are added bonuses that can be unlocked as players enjoy solving the mind benders. For example, various monsters and asteroids distract you as you work on puzzle, but by removing them you earn special hints, adding to the fun factor. Wallpapers also become available after completing certain puzzle problems which can then be used to change the background graphic of each game.
