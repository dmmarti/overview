Labyrinth is the sequel to a SNES game called On the Ball.  The object of the game is to manipulate a ball through a maze to the checkered goal line.    To do this, players must rotate the level around to navigate their way through obstacles.  The ball is constantly falling towards the bottom of the screen, ignoring whatever direction the maze is facing.  There are two ways to control the ball.  The first is by using the L and R Shoulder buttons to rotate the maze left or right.  The other method is to rotate the maze map on the touch screen using the stylus.  Players can also briefly surround their ball with lightning which will shatter certain blocks.  It's also possible to customize your ball - you can increase or decrease the weight of your ball, as well as change the colour and material it is made from.  In addition to the single player mode, Labyrinth also features a Single-Cart Multiplayer mode.  In this mode, up to four players can take part in making their way through the maze.  The first player to reach the goal is the winner.
