Dogz for the DS is remake of the original Dogz for the GBA, and, along with Catz, the first installment of the Petz series in the DS. Start off with choosing your dog from a large selection of 18 different breeds that come in many colors. Take your dog out for walks, enter it in competitions, and even throw parties with all the other dogs in the neighborhood you meet on your daily stroll. Taking good care of your dog does come with its rewards! You will receive gifts and presents to decorate your room, as well as toys and things to buy at the pet store for your new puppy.  With the new voice recognition feature, you can call your dog to come to you, as well as teaching it new tricks and commands. With the touch screen feature, you can write in your diary about your day with your puppy. Lastly, with the networking feature, you can share your puppy mini-games with your friends! All this and more.
