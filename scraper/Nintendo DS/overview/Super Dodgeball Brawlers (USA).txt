Super Dodgeball Brawlers is a remake of the classic dodgeball sports NES title with characters that resembles those from River City Ransom and Double Dragon.

The original mode still exists, but now has new rules that allow punching, kicking and using weapons against the opposing team. There is a create-a-character option as well.

There are also over a hundred special attacks that can be used against opponents such as Cactus Attack, Panda Shot and Spear to name a few. The new Super Gauge System, when filled, can be given to a player on the court to boosts stats or unleash an "Instant Kill" against an opponent.

Friends can go head-to-head against a friend or even join up against eight people using Wi-Fi.
