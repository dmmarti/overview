After arriving at the Animal Village, you try desperately to fit in and make friends.  After almost succeeding, a boxing gym opens and all the animals join up.  Looks like you'll have to take part, too.  Get ready to box!  Animal Boxing is a game that requires you to hold the Nintendo DS upside down to play.  The player uses the touch screen to punch in a variety of ways - tapping your opponent throws a standard punch, swiping horizontally throws a hook, and swiping upwards throws an uppercut.  By holding the stylus on-screen longer, you can charge power for a more powerful punch.  The Control Pad is used to dodge left and right, as well as block.  As your boxer takes and delivers hits, their Anger Meter increases.  When it is at its maximum, your boxer fills with rage, and all of their attacks become more powerful for a limited time.  This can be used to turn the tide in a match.  However, opponents can also use this tactic, meaning that blocking and dodging become very important during these moments!  As with other boxing games, your goal is to defeat your opponents in a series of bouts to win the championship belts.  Once you defeat the champion, you'll win the belt and progress to the next championship.  Each championship you win unlocks new animals to fight against in the Vs. Animal matches, as well as new items to decorate your boxer with.
