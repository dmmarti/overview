Alfonso Senior, having made his fortune from the original Pipe Mania, has retired to Paradise Island. Unfortunately, the island has an alarmingly high number of plumbing-related problems. Alfonso's retired, but he's called in his kids Junior and Fawcett to fix up the island, and maybe learn a few things about plumbing along the way.  Gameplay is similar to the classic Pipe Dream/Pipe Mania, but with a more mission-based structure, and more unusual modes. Missions can be replayed to get a higher grade, and high grades can unlock various treasures, such as movies, character bios, and new game modes. Pipe Mania even has a multiplayer mode; compete against a friend for points, or use your attacks to damage your opponent's pipes.
