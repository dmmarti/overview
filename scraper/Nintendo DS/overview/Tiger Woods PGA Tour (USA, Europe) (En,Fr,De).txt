Tiger Woods PGA Tour is the first game in the long running golf series to appear on the Nintendo DS. The game features a Quick Play mode and a Legends Tour mode. In the Quick Play mode the player gets to play single matches either alone or against three opponents. Five authentic courses and one fantasy course are available in the game and the player can choose to play stroke play, match play or skins. The Legends Tour allows the player to take on the best players from around the world. The player starts out on the Rookie Tour but by earning Tour Cards the Pro and Legend Tours are unlocked. By completing events on the tours the player earns cash that can be used to upgrade the golfer's attributes. 

The game features an analog control method using the touch screen of the DS. Before taking the shot the player is presented with a top down of the course that allows the player to adjust his aim. Once that is done two meters appear on the touch screen. One is u-shaped and controls the swing. The power of the shot is determined by how the player draws the stylus on the right side of the meter while the left side determines how straight the shot gets. There is also a boost meter that has to be rubbed repeatedly to add some distance to the shot. Once the ball is in the air the player can influence its rotation by dragging the stylus in the right direction. 

Multiplayer exists for up to four players through wireless communication. All players can play the game simultaneously so no-one has to wait for their turn.
