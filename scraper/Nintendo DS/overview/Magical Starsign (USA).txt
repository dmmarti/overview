Magical Starsign is Role Playing Game about a group of students at the Will Oâ€™ Wisp magical academy. When their teacher mysteriously disappears they set out to find and rescue her. As she is on a different planet, this involves space travel. The player starts out alone, but one by one the classmates join the quest.  The students are each specialized in a different art of magic, linked to a starsign. As the planets move through the sky (as seen on the 'astrolog') the magic associated with that sign grows stronger and weaker. This applies to the monsters as well, which adds a strategic element to the gameplay.   As characters grow stronger, they learn new spells. During combat, players tap on the attacks they want to use and then tap on an enemy to target. By tapping the character's head at the exact moment they release the spell, the attack is extra effective.   There are two multiplayer options. The first, tag mode, allows players to exchange data with one another. In the magical rocket, an egg will hatch that will slowly develop into a new unique character. In the amigo dungeon mode up to six people can explore an 'amigo dungeon'.
