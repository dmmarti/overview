Heroes of Mana is a continuation of Square Enix's, World of Mana series, but with a new twist in the gameplay.  This time around the gameplay is now real-time, where players can build bases and their own armies consisting of humans, monsters and rabites throughout the Mana series.  The story takes place when a witch by the name of Anise brought darkness to the land, unleashing hordes of monsters on the world.  She is eventually defeated by the guardians of the trees, but the evil she unleashed was unable to me stopped until the Mana Goddess uses the Mana Sword to seal off the darkness in eight stones, bringing peace to the world.  This is where the players takes control of the main protagonist, Roget, a younger warrior who has learned that somehow the evil is coming back into the world and must embark on a quest with 10 other comrades and countless created units and stop the evil forces from being unleashed again.  The player uses the stylus mostly throughout the game, touching on a certain character and touching somewhere on the screen to move them around or draw circles around multi characters to move them all at once.  Players do battle by selecting their unit and tapping enemy units with the stylus to use that units attack skill on that selected enemy.  Players can also build building and units to help them out by gathering two resources throughout the game, Gaia (which is responsible for buildings) and Treant (for units) all of which is located in the players main base, a large ship. Each unit has a different skill, some are good against enemy units others are used for resource gathering.  Friends can also compete through Wi-Fi head-to-head as well as see their ranking against other players.  Players can also earn bonus items and maps through this if their ranking is high enough.  The music is also composed by Yoko Shimomura who is also responsible for music in games such as Kingdom Hearts, Legend of Mana and Super Mario RPG as well.
