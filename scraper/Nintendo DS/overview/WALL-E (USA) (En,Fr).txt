WALL-E is the video game adaptation of the movie of the same name. 

As the player plays through the levels, they unlock clips from the movie viewable at any time. 

The story mode seems to be altered the character's roles and different from the movie such as WALL-E can commonly use its laser, EVE is tasered by AUTO (referenced to WALL-E being tasered in the original.), WALL-E repairing EVE (in the original, EVE tries to repair WALL-E), and WALL-E survived from getting crushed by the Holo-Detector. The reversal of EVE and WALL-E being damaged was actually intended to occur in the movie, but was later changed.
