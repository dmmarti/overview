Based on the Cartoon Network series, Xiaolin Showdown for the Nintendo DS is an isometric beat 'em up that takes you around the world, from the Xiaolin Temple and the streets of Tokyo to Jack Spicer's secret laboratory and the inside of a dragon's stomach.

Playing as any of the four trainee monks from the TV show (Omi, Clay, Kimiko and Raimundo), it's up to you to recover the mystical Shen Gong Wu by defeating the likes of Jack Spicer, Panda Bubba and Chase Young in wacky Xiaolin Showdown mini-games. But to reach the villains, first you'll need to battle your way through their henchmen, from robot cheerleaders and zombie construction workers to tigers and tuxedo-wearing gangsters.

Adding to the replayability, each of the four monks has his or her own unique moves and special elemental attacks, which you can unlock as you play through the game. You can also use the weird and wonderful powers of the Shen Gong Wu that you collect to aid you in your quest, including the Two Ton Tunic, the Third Arm Sash and the Star Hanabi.
