Play as Garfield and Odie to try and get Garfield's humor back. Travel to the magical pond in hopes to win back Arlene's heart in this 2D platformer where you will be jumping, attacking, and collecting different items. The controls are simple, you'll be using the D-pad and buttons for most actions. The stylus and touch screen will be used for the rhythm based mini games. There is also an interactable world map to get to each level.
