Bust-a-Move lands on the Nintendo DS in this handheld entry. As Bub &amp; Bob from the original Bubble Bobble arcade game, your goal is to clear the top screen of bubbles by throwing your coloured bubble into the pack creating a group of 3 or more, which causes them to disappear.   This edition allows you to throw the bubbles with the touchscreen and offers over 250 puzzles to play and more to unlock. It also offers multiplayer for up to 5 players over multi card or single card DS Download play.  This game is not to be confused with the Japanese only Puzzle Bobble DS, which does not offer the touchscreen controls, was created by a different development studio and includes different levels.
