Chomp is a Pac-Man variant. Like in the original game and most of its clones the player controls the chomp through mazes full of dots that have to be collected while being chased by four ghosts that have to be avoided. Any contact with them will lead to a lost life but by eating a power pill the player can for a short moment go after and kill the ghosts. Additionally the chomp can eat berries for bonus points. A level is completed when all dots have been eaten and the game goes on until all of the player's three lives are lost.
