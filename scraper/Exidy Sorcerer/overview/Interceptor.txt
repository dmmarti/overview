Interceptor is a variant of the arcade game Scramble although it only includes the first section where the player flies over a mountainous terrain. The game scroll from left to right with the player flying the interceptor up and down and using two weapons. There are pulses that are fired straight forward and there are bombs that are dropped on ground targets. There are several different enemies that have to be avoided or shot down. There are also energy pods on the ground that have to be destroyed to replenish the ship's energy level. The aim of the game is to fly as far as possible. After 100 km, bonus points are given and the game restarts.
