Martian Invaders is a Space Invaders variant. Like in the arcade game the player takes control of a space ship that can be moved left and right along the bottom of the screen. Above it are the martians which move back and forth and that the player has to shoot down before they reach the bottom of the screen. Upon killing all of them the game progresses to a new level. Unlike the arcade original there are no barriers to offer protection from the projectiles dropped by the martians. The UFO passing by at the top of the screen makes an appearance though. The player only has one life so when getting hit the game has to be replayed from the start.
