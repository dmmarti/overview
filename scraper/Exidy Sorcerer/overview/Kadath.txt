Kadath is a multiple choice text adventure based on some of the the environments created by H. P. Lovecraft in his novella The Dream-Quest of Unknown Kadath. It features non-linear exploration, simple inventory puzzles and a time limit based on the number of moves the player makes.

After having discovered an ancient tablet at an archaeological dig and spending the last decade trying to translate it with the help of the Necronomicon and other diabolical incunabula, the game's protagonist has finally succeeded in unlocking its secrets and has descended upon the city of Yaddith, the ancient home of the Elder Ones. In order to prevent their return in fifteen days when the stars are right, the Eye of Kadath has to be found to invoke the powers of the Elder Ones and destroy the gate between worlds in order to save all of mankind from their reign of terror.
