This game, as the name suggests, is a hockey simulation which is very similar to Mario Lemieux Hockey. There are 22 teams to choose from which are based on the NHL 91 line up though they can be changed if the player wishes. You control 1 player at a time and the CPU controls the rest of your team though you can switch to a different player at any time if the need arises. There is also a fight penalty system where you have to continually punch the an opponent in order to proceed. The game is viewed from an isometric perspective as if you were sat in one of the crowd seats.
