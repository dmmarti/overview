Two classic Atari arcade games were updated for this compilation. This Lynx version of Asteroids and Missile Command contains some enhanced features to justify the "super" in the title.

Super Asteroids has all new graphics to replace the vector outlines of the original. Your ship has a shield that can absorb several collisions before it blows up. There are also power ups to increase your firepower.

Super Missile Command also has all new graphics.  Between rounds, you can trade credits earned during gameplay to purchase special weapons that will help you later in the game.
