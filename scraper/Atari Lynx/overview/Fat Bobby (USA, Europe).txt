Lead guitarist, Fat Bobby is rocking the house with his band when the evil Dr. Mephisto swoops down from the rafters. He kidnaps the band leaving Fat Bobby to finish his solo or go on a musical rampage to get his bros back. Not one to give up, Fat Bobby takes his guitar and chases down Dr. Mephisto and his henchman. He loves to rock, but his guitar can "strum" more than notes. Musically weaponized, he's off to get his bandmates with the help of his guitar-gun (maybe it's a mortar - hard to say). Fat Bobby is a single player platformer that primarily side scrolls, but also has some vertical territory to explore. There's nothing particularly stellar about the graphics or game play... which is a shame because I like the story - brief as it is.A rocker sets out to rescue his band with his weaponized guitar! That's awesome and deserves a much better game to accompany that story. The graphics aren't bad, they just don't pop the way they should when a rockstar is shooting enemies with a guitar-gun. The real issue is jumping. That B button combined with directional movement can result in some unpredictable results. By "unpredictable" I mean you die.As Fat Bobby jumps, his impressive vertical rise causes a slight jerk to the screen as it scrolls to keep him in view. Thankfully, each leap can be made As you seek out your bandmates, you'll encounter Dr. Mephisto's henchmen and a variety of items to pick up from musical notes to egg timers and shields. Each level is timed, but you should have no problem cruising through it without watching the clock. Fat Bobby rocks out at the conclusion of each level.
