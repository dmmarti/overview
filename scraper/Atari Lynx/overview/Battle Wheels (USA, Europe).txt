The year is 2019, and the world is bored with conventional entertainment.  Enter the world of BattleWheels, where contestants fight in post-apocalyptic deserts and dead cities in the most violent destruction derby ever.  At your disposal are machine guns, flame throwers, missiles, mines, and even paint (to obstruct someone's view).  And if you survive your car getting destroyed, you can hoof it and try to wreak as much carnage as possible before becoming roadkill.  You can buy a pre-made car, or customize your own car with different levels of engine power, suspension, and armor.

BattleWheels can be comlynxed up to 6 simultaneous players.
