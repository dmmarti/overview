This is Malibu Bikini Volleyball, written by Handmade Software, which brings sand, surf, and scantily-clad members of both genders together for some two-on-two fun. You can serve, spike, and dive either in a three-round elimination tournament, or a single game with four difficulty levels. Options allow you to change the ball speed, turn indicator boxes and winds on or off, and set the score and time limits.
