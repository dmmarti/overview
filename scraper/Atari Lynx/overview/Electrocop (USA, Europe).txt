Today, if a daughter of the President goes missing, I would look in the nearest bar. However, in the near future, the explanation is that she's been kidnapped by a Criminal Brain robot, and held in a booby-trapped lair. As the advanced hybrid Electrocop, your task is to rescue her within an hour.

Gameplay involves working your way through the complex warehouse maze, unlocking coded door along the way. Extra weapons can be collected to help dealing with the drones. There are also computer terminals to buy new weapons - these also have simple subgames built in. What makes the game unique, and intended as a showpiece for the Lynx hardware, is that full 3D is used, so that the character walks in and out of the screen as well as across it.
