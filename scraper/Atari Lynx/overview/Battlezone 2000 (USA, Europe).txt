In this game you play the role of a tank commander who is fighting in a future war in the 21st century. The game is an update on the classic arcade game Battlezone and stays true to the original in terms of gameplay. The gameplay involves you driving round a landscape destroying enemy tanks and U.F.O.s  whilst trying not to run out of fuel and also not getting destroyed yourself though luckily there are fuel pick-ups and power-ups to collect. You can also use the credits earned for completing missions to upgrade your tank. There are also a few different tanks to choose from including the Rhino which is heavily armoured but runs out of fuel faster than the other tanks.
