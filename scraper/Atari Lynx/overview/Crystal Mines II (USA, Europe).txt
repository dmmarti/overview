Crystal Mines II is an update of the gameplay in its predecessor; in a nutshell, overhead puzzle-solving best described as Chip's Challenge meets Boulder Dash, with a touch of real-time elements thrown in.

In Crystal Mines II, you operate a robot going through the abandoned crystal mines, picking up crystals and avoiding the underground demons that inhabit the mine.  Mine levels are completed when a crystal quota is reached, however the quota is usually not the entire level so bonus points can be obtained by finding additional crystals.  Like Boulder Dash, gravity is a factor and affects any boulders, crystals, etc. so they can be used as weapons against demons.  There are also deceptive elements, such as &quot;Dormant&quot; demons that look like boulders, that add to the challenge.  Finally, the robot has weapons that can be used to eliminate certain obstacles.
