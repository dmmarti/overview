The gang is at it again!  This time, Mystery Inc. must stop an evil business tycoon who has used a device called the Tome of Doom and release monsters from another dimension to distract the gang from what is going on.  They must grab the Tome and send the monsters back to where they came before it's too late.

The player takes control of Shaggy and Scooby with the ability to switch between the two, each with their own special abilities to set traps and capture monsters, and wearing disguises to sneak past them as well.  The gameplay is mostly consisted of puzzle-solving (i.e. moving objects into certain spots to open doors) and players can explore a movie set, The Wild West, a bayou and a laboratory.

Features the actual voices of the Scooby Doo cartoons and features artwork and stills of the shows.
