Mario and the team, including Peach, Donkey Kong, Yoshi, Luigi and Wario, return for another round of golf.

Play through courses either with real life situations (your typical bunker or water hazard) to fantasy 'Mario World' settings, such as a Chain Chomp awaiting your ball in the sand traps and using warp pipes to get further towards the hole quickly and easily.

Up to 4 players can play at any one time in Tournament and Match Play modes, with the obvious goal being the one who wins the tournament taking the least amount of shots to do so.
