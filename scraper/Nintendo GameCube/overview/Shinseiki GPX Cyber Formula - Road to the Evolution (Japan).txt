Futuristic racing game based on the Shinseiki GPX anime series, featuring a higher speed version of Formula One racing. Cyber Formula cars are designed to go as fast as 600km per hour, racing around sci-fi inspired circuits at break-neck speeds. Modes include Grand Prix (standard GP style racing, complete with qualification laps and multi-circuit competition), Arcade (drive free run, one match, survival match, point match, or time attack races), private area (a museum of sorts, with history, shops, card gallery, audio room, and more), as well as a two-player split-screen Versus mode. Select from drift or grip machine types, and use a built-in turbo boost to leave the competition in the dust.
