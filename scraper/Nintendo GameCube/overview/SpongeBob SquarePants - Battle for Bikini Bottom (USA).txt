Plankton's latest diabolical scheme to steal the Krabby Patty formula hinges on the creation of an army of evil robots, who will do his bidding.  But because Plankton forgot to throw the "Obey Plankton" switch, the army of robots have run amuck and are terrorizing Bikini Bottom.  Help SpongeBob, Patrick and Sandy save Bikini Bottom!
