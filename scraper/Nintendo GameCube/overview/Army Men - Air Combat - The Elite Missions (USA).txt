The little green army men take to the skies once again. Choose from five different choppers (each with different defense, attack, payload and control styles) and take them onto the battlefield where you'll be asked to pick up supplies, defend fellow green army men or destroy the tan army both on the ground and in the air.

Use the tow line to pick up items and use them against the tan army, or to pick up power-ups to improve your choppers defense and attack.

2 player split screen action has you fighting against each other and racing to pick up items before the other does.
