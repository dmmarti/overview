International Superstar Soccer 2 is a next-generation update of Konami's well-received International Superstar Soccer, featuring a similar array of modes (friendly, international cup, league, training) to the original. This installment also makes use of an official FIFPro licence, meaning that many of the 58 national teams include real player names.
