The Muppets remember the fun times they had on their last vacation in this 4-player party game.  This game follows the pattern of most party games, like Mario Party, for example, in that your overall goal is to win a board game.  To win the board game, you must succeed at a variety of mini games, which may include a wide variety of gameplay styles. Winning a mini game earns you a party favor of a certain color.  The ultimate goal is to accumulate the most party favors to win.  Party favors you win can then be used to unlock additional mini games and bonus videos.  If you unlock enough mini games, you can then unlock a new game board in the main game.

You can choose to play as Gonzo, Animal, Kermit, Miss Piggy, Pepe, or Fonzie.  In addition, a lot of other Muppet characters have cameo appearances.
