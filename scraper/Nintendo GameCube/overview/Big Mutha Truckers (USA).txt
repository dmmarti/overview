Big Mutha Truckers is a truck racing game where you are one of Ma Jackson's four kids. You have to make money for 60 days. The one who earns most money in that period will get Ma's bussiness. There are plenty obstacles to change your success to failure.

Players make cash by trading various commodities in the five cities that make up Hick State County, by taking on special jobs (some legal, some not so legal), by wagering with other rival drivers and by causing as much chaos as possible!
