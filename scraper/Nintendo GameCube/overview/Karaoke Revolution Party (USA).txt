The Karaoke Revolution continues with this entry which supports the DDR dance pad and EyeToy USB camera as well as the required USB microphone (a handheld microphone is included).  Karaoke Revolution Party features 50 new songs (ranging from Dean Martin's That's Amore to Beyonce's Crazy in Love) and a host of new party options.

Sing by yourself, in a duet, or compete one-on-one or in teams to show your Karaoke mastery.  Characters now have more customization options and you can use the EyeToy USB camera to really be the star of the show.  If you have a DDR dance pad, then you can put on a song and dance routine.  There are also a variety of minigames to test your vocal abilities including unique takes on volleyball and stage diving.
