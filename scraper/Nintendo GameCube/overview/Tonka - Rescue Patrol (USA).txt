Designed for younger children, Tonka: Rescue Patrol lets you drive a firetruck, police car, helicopter, and many other vehicles, as well as helping out around the city. For example, the firetruck might drive to a building on fire to put the fire out, while a crane may move construction material to where it is needed.

There are multiple environments to work in, including a city, country and even an academy to show how to use the vehicles. In the garage, you can clean and repair the vehicles, or even change the paint color.
