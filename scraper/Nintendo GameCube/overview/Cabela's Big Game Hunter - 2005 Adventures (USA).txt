Another in the Big Game Hunting series, 2005 Adventures brings you 36 big game animals in 10 locations.  Choose from many guns, bows, equipment, and clothing before heading out to take on these animals.

Head out looking for whatever animal(s) you have tags for.  Track your target through mountains, plains, hills, streams, and lakes.  Swim across lakes and streams that are in your way and drive various vehicles to save time getting where you're going.  Once you find your prey, get close enough to shoot without your target noticing you.  Then take the shot!

Play the game in quick hunt or career mode, or play with friends online.  Go to your cabin to see the animals you have shot in career mode... you can even choose your what cabin you want out of six choices!

Unlike many other hunting games that have you go out and kill what you can in a single day, you can take as many days as you need to bag your limit.  Use tents to sleep away the nights, or walk around looking for possible spots to sit and wait for prey on the following day... just don't forget to eat and drink to keep up your energy.

Play through rain and snow as well as clear weather conditions.  Animals behave differently in different conditions, just like in real life.
