Play as Nickelodeon's T.V. star Jimmy Neutron as he saves the day from aliens from outer space. Travel through six levels as you complete missions to gather inventions to help defeat the aliens. Collect points (for a higher score) by completing objectives, finding hidden areas and unlocking new inventions. Whenever you find a new invention, you can enter a practice mode to try out the new invention. Such inventions include: a rocket ship to fly around town, a shrink ray to shrink your enemies and a scooter that is used with your pet dog invention Goddard to ride him to move around a lot faster.
