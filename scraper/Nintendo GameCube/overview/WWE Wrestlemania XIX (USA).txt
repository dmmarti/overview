WWE Wrestlemania XIX is the second WWE wrestling game for the Gamecube and the third edition in the Wrestlemania series for Nintendo consoles. 

It features a number of additions and improvements on the previous game, such as improved graphics, more realistic moves, the latest WWE Superstars, and, most importantly, a brand new story mode that sees your created wrestler attempting to destory Vince's wrestling empire as he prepares for Wrestlemania. 

Wrestlemania XIX features a highly customisable Create-a-Wrestler mode that allows you to modify every little nuance of your own WWE Superstar. It also includes a brand new Create-an-Entrance mode that gives you more control over your Superstar's ring entrance than any wrestling game to date.

Also included is WWE Shopzone (TM), in which you can spend the money you've earned in the Story mode on new attire, weapons, moves, or ability points to increase the strength of your created Superstar.
