After two adventures on the Game Boy Advance, Kururin goes 3D on the GameCube. In Kururin Squash!, you have to direct Kururin in his helicopter-like Heririn spinning stick through narrow mazes, while avoiding obstacles or courses' sides. The gameplay is spiced up with colourful backgrounds, bizarre enemies,  weapons and bounce pads that change the spin direction. When you get hit three times, the Heririn shatters.

The GameCube version introduces water levels with a submarine, guns, boxing gloves, twisters, flame-throwing and boss battles. In the main puzzle mode, you have to collect loot and in the race mode, you have to finish the mazes within a target time. Multiplayer includes four-player split-screen frenzy and a battle mode where you have to collect coins while using the weapons to hold off your opponents.
