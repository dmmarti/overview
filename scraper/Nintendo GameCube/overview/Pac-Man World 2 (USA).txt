Long ago, an evil stronger then anything before or after it, was trapped underneath a tree, which grew the five golden fruits. Years later the band of ghosts, who continue to roam Pac-World, have stolen the fruits from the tree. Unknown to them, they have also unleashed the evil that lurked beneath the tree on a helpless Pac-World. Only one Pac can return the five golden fruits to the tree and stop both the ghosts and the new evil from destroying Pac-World, and that's Pac-Man.

Using his famous munching skills, Pac-Man must explore 20 monster, pit and trap filled levels. But of course, the Pac-Pills can be found across each map to aid Pac-Man in his quest.

The game also features four classic Pac-Man games to unlock, all taken from different Namco compilations. They are, in order of appearance:

Pac-Man (taken from Namco Museum Vol. 1)
2. Ms. Pac-Man (taken from Namco Museum Vol. 3)
3. Pac-Mania (taken from Namco Museum Vol. 5)
4. Pac-Attack (remake taken from Namco Anthology 2)
