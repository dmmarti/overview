Take up the tough job of a farmer in this most recent addition to the Harvest Moon franchise. Work through a long day of watering and planting crops, tending to animals and getting to know the villagers. Unlike past games in the series this one works on a chapter basis as you progress through the seasons.

Various goals include marrying one of the village women(or men in the upcoming for girls edition) and having children to help you with your work as you get older. The gameplay and the abstract goals are similar to the GameCube game Animal Crossing.
