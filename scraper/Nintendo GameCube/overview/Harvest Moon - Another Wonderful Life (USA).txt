Harvest Moon: Another Wonderful Life has the same gameplay as Harvest Moon: A Wonderful Life.  The game is a farming simulation in which the player inherits a run-down farm and must make it profitable, start a family and develop relationships with the neighbors. The major difference is that the player is now female rather than male and can choose a husband and have a child.  Other additions are the ability to change outfits and a mirror in the house that will tell the player if she needs to eat or sleep. The game spans six chapters but will end after the first chapter if the player doesn't get married.  The Game Boy Advance game Harvest Moon: More Friends of Mineral Town can be connected to this game to unlock extra bonuses.
