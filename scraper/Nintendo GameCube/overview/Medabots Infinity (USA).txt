In Medabots: Infinity, Ikki and his Medabot goes to the Toru-Toru Land amusement park to compete in the Medafighter race. Throughout the park are "attractions", which put your customized Medabot in a map. Travel through the map to the exit, fighting enemies, avoiding traps, and solving puzzles. You can find points along the way, which will make your Medabot stronger, as well as new parts, which can be installed on your Medabot. 

Along with the adventure mode, an arena mode is included, (fight against either the computer or another player) as well as the ability to unlock secret characters by hooking up either MedaBots: Metabee Version or Rokusho Version.
