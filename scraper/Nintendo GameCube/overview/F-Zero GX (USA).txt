Join Captain Falcon and a host of drivers from around the galaxy in this, the return of F-Zero.

Along with the hallmark elements of the previous titles (high speed racing through futuristic tracks that range from difficult to down right crazy, against up to 29 different racers at any one time), GX introduces a new story mode which details the backstory of each driver and creates a new sense of importance to each race.

Depending on your result through the 15 tracks, you'll receive prize money which can go towards the purchase of new parts to increase your power and speed of your racer. No weapons are used during each race, so it will take skill to get to the top.

Also included are a 4 player split-screen mode, the option of full customization the look of your vehicle, plus plenty of unlockable extras to find.
