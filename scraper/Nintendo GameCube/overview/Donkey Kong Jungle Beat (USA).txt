After the Donkey Konga games, Nintendo thought of a novelty use for the DK Bongos device. In Jungle Beat, you still have to match the rhythm by hitting the bongos timely, but the visual presentation is a platformer, much like a regular Donkey Kong game. You control Donkey Kong by hitting the left or right bongos, while tapping both drums together or clapping allows for jumps, vine-swinging, wall-kicks, ground pounding and other moves.

You have to cross 40 areas to rid the island of evil kongs. During your journey, you can travel using a variety of animals, and they each need a certain rhythm to control. Aside from the input device, it is a regular platformer with power-ups, bananas to collect, many enemies and end bosses.

There are two versions of the game - one with the DK Bongos included and a lower-priced version without the device.
