Based on the movie remake of the 1969 film, The Italian Job is the story of a gang of thieves who stage the ultimate gold heist of all time. Little do they know that one of their gang members has double-crossed them, taking the gold and leaving them for dead.

As a member of the team, it is your job to stage the next big heist of all time, taking back the gold from your former friend. The game allows you to control a range of vehicles which you must drive to destinations before a certain time limit in order for the plan to work. Of course, the Mini comes into play as you escape from police.

Apart from the movie based story mode, you can also drive the Mini's through a range of multiplayer modes, including stunt driving and circuit racing.
