Darkseid has joined forces with Lex Luthor, unleashing an army of robotic warriors on the city of Metropolis, and the world. So once again it is up to Superman to save the day.

Based on the recent animated TV series, Superman will travel around with all powers intact through 14 levels in order to defeat the robots and the many other bad guys that are out to take over the world.

Superman's powers once again include freeze breath, x-ray vision, heat vision and super strength. The new 1st person mode also allows even stronger attacks at a far more accurate rate. In between levels are fully animated cut scenes that tell the story, as Superman goes head on with Livewire, Parasite, Metallo, Luthor and Darkseid.
