In Shaman King - Soul Fight: Players may choose from a cast of 20+ characters featured in the series to do battle. Fighting is essentially a game of rock-paper-scissors. Characters have 3 different attacks with attributes that may be customized to their liking. Attacks are chosen and played out on-screen by the characters who are indirectly controlled. Successful attacks build a crystal meter to launch cinematic specials that come in three levels, each a step up in strength from the last. The game also features a lengthy fully voiced story mode that follows the anime and a character training mode. There are a variety of unlockables, including much of the playable cast as hidden characters.
