The Lylat System has been at peace for several years after the mysterious disaster was averted on Dinosaur Planet. But, alas, Andrew Oikonny, who has been kicked out of Star Wolf, seems to have taken over Andross's army, and to make things even trickier, strange insect-like creatures called Aparoids have started to appear all around and destroy and assimilate objects.

Star Fox Assault marks a return to the space and air combat in the spirit of the original Star Fox and Star Fox 64 games. In addition to this, Fox and friends get to fight on foot, using various different kinds of weapons, and the Landmaster tank. The game includes a 10-mission campaign as well as a rather varied multiplayer mode.
