One Piece: Pirates' Carnival is a quirky party game based on the Japanese anime One Piece. You start with seven characters including Luffy, Nami and others. The game is played on different boards and most include mini-games to unlock more boards and additional mini-games. A lot of games are copies of other games, some from the Mario Party series and others are based on Concentration or Where's Waldo?. You can unlock over thirty mini-games and over a dozen characters. Additionally, character cards and voice collections can be unlocked by progressing through the game. There is a main story mode, the board game mode, the mini-game collection mode and a versus mode with up to four players.
