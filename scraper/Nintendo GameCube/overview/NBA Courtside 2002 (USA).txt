NBA Courtside 2002 is the GameCube's first basketball game.  It utilizes motion-captured moves and face-mapping.  There are a total of 29 NBA teams plus the Western All-Stars and the Eastern All-Stars. You can perform adrenaline-boosted moves or alley-oop dunks. Passing can be done easily with the introduction of the C-Stick passing. The game boasts a great number of dunks and layups animations.

There are six ways to play: Quick Play, Full Season, Playoffs, Three-Point Shootout, Arcade, and Practice. Arcade mode is 3-on-3, NBA Jam-style action and is played on an outdoor court.
