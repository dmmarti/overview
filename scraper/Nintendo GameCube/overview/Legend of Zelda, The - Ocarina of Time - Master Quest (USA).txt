The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time / Master Quest is a compilation disc containing the N64 classic The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time and the never-released 64DD Ura Zelda. Never sold at retail, the compilation was available as a pre-order bonus for The Legend of Zelda: The Wind Waker, sold with certain GameCube bundles, or made available through Nintendo of Europe's Stars Catalogue. Both games run at a higher resolution than the original versions, plus feature 480p Progressive Scan support and Dolby Surround.

Master Quest is essentially the same game as Ocarina of Time. While the adventure unfolds in the same way (same enemies, items, characters), the difference lies in the dungeon layouts. Dungeons are remixed, meaning that item placement and room progression have been altered. So, even if you have already played Ocarina of Time, Master Quest offers a new take on a familiar setting.

Also included on the compilation are video previews of various GameCube and GBA games. Included on the North American and European disc:

1. F-Zero GX
2. 1080ï¿½ Avalanche
3. Wario World
4. The Legend of Zelda: The Wind Waker
5. Metroid Prime
6. The Legend of Zelda: A Link to the Past/Four Swords
7. ...and more
