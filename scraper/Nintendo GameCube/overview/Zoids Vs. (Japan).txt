This game lets players customize their own personal Zoids, then jump into battle against the computer AI or an opposing player. The game features characters taken from the series as well as introduces a few new ones. Additionally, every Zoid features a special attack, called an EX Attack, that can be used once the Zoid's hit points drop below 1/3. Many of the EX attacks are special attacks featured in the anime, such as the Blade Liger's Hi-Blade attack, the Geno Saurer's Charged Particle Cannon, or the Liger Zero's Strike Laser Claw.
