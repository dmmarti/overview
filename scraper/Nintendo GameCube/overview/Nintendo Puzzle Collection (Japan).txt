This Japanese exclusive collection includes three classic puzzle games:

1. Dr. Mario
2. Tetris Attack (Panel de Pon)
3. Yoshi's Cookie

The games have been ported from older systems and enhanced with additional modes and support for four-player games. In Dr. Mario and Tetris Attack multiplayer games, players who die can play a singleplayer game until the game is completely over. The Game Boy Advance can be used as an additional controller and the games can also be downloaded to the handheld as singleplayer versions.
