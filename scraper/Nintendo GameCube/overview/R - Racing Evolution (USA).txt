R:Racing Evolution is a racing game featuring several modes of gameplay:

Racing Life: This is a single player story mode. You play the part of Rena Hayami who begins the story as an ambulance driver. After successfully racing the vehicle to the hospital, you're offered a chance to drive a racecar. Rena's saga to become champion and defeat her rivals will unfold in various cut scenes between races and driving challenges that you must complete. There are 14 chapters total. 

Event Challenge: There are a variety of racing events you can enter, each with an entrance few you must earn by winning previous challenges. You can also tune up your car or buy new cars.

Arcade Mode: Here you can run a single race against computer controlled cars on the track of your choice. You can set several game options, such as the number of laps and rival cars.

Time Attack: Choose a racetrack and car, and try to earn the best time!

VS. Mode: This is a two player game. Choose a track, and two players race for either the best time or earn the most points.

The game features a variety of racing options you can set, including brake assist (will automatically brake for you if you enter a turn too fast), transmission types (automatic or manual), race difficulty, and adjustments to your cars performance. There are a variety of cars available, each with unique speed and steering characteristics. You can also unlock more cars by playing Racing Life and Event Challenge.  There is also a pressure meter: when driving behind another vehicle, you will begin to apply psychological pressure to the driver which is indicated by a meter above the car. When full, the driver will be very likely to make a mistake giving you an opportunity to pass easily! There is an instant replay option, and you can save your best (or worst!) races for viewing later on.
