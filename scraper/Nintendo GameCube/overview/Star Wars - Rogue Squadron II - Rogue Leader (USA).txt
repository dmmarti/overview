Star Wars: Rogue Leader - Rogue Squadron II is the first Star Wars game to appear on a 6th-generation gaming console.

The game puts you in the role of either Luke Skywalker or Wedge Antilles through many different missions in an assortment of aircraft, such as the X-Wing, B-Wing, Snowspeeder, and more.

Rogue Squadron II features about fifteen levels and has a large amount secrets to unlock.  The missions are split up into missions taken from the Star Wars movies, such as the attack on the Death Star and the Battle Of Hoth, where some are made up purely for the game itself and has no bearing on any of the movies.

Rogue Leader closely follows the Star Wars movies, with locations you will recognize.  The voice of Wedge Antilles is by the actor who played him in the movie.

You must earn different medals (Gold, Silver, Bronze) for each mission by completing it a different way.  For example, be the mission in under three minutes for a Gold.  When you have enough medals, you unlock bonuses, such as extra ships and extra missions.

RL also features a section seen mostly on movie DVD's, that takes you behind the scenes of the making of the game, and other bonus footage.
