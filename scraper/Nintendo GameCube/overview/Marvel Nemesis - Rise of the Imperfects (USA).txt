When New York City is attacked by aliens, the greatest heroes (and villains) in the Marvel Universe confront them.  Marvel Nemesis has two playing modes, a single-player story mode, where players brawl their way through a Mark Millar scripted tale, and a single- or two-player versus mode pitting heroes and villains against each other in a sandbox arena.

Famous Marvel characters have been reimagined by artist Jae Lee and new characters have been created for this game series.  The PS2 and Xbox versions support online play and all versions have unlockable arenas, characters, and extras.
