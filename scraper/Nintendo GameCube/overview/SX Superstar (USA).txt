SX superstar is a motocross racing game. In arcade mode, you can pick a rider, bike, and track, and have a quick race against the AI riders.  In championship mode you start as a poor, amateur rider, and you try to work your way up to motocross stardom.  You have to manage your finances, get sponsorships, and buy better bikes in order to beat your opponents.  You have to do well in a variety of races including arenas, bajas, and A2Bs, in order to get promoted to higher leagues.
