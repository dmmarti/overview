Barbarian takes place in various 3D arenas where you and your opponents' characters can move about freely. Similar to the Dead or Alive games, the arenas are pretty huge, and you can be knocked down to different parts of the level, where the fights will resume. While the controls are responsive enough, combat is noticeably lacking the visceral punch of other Rastan games as well as most other fighting games. While your character can run around the arena in a three dimensional space (as opposed to more restrictive sidestepping and dodging systems seen in Sapphire's previous 3D fighters) the lack of impact when damaging an opponent or being damaged really hurts the proceedings.
