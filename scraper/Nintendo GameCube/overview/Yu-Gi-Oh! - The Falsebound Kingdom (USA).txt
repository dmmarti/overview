In Yu-Gi-Oh!'s first RPG, Yugi, Joey and the rest of the gang are sucked into a virtual game created by a mad scientist who wants revenge for Kaiba for firing him. You can play either as Yugi or Kaiba to stop the evil emperor from taking over the world and at the same time trying to escape the game. But, only three things block their path to freedom: Obliesk, Silfer, and Ra the egyptian gods. Can you defeat them?
