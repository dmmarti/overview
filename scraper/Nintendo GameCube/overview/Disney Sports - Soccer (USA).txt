Disney Sports Skateboarding, much as the title implies, is a skateboarding game game based on the Disney license.  It features eight levels set around the world and many favorite Disney characters like Mickey, Minnie, Donald and Goofy.

Like most modern skateboarding games, the structure of Disney Sports Skateboarding owes much to the Tony Hawk series.  Here, the trick system is far simpler as there's no balance meter and most tricks require fewer buttons.  Each level has a set of goals that must be accomplished in order to progress, such as a high score goal, knocking over objects or completing a checkpoint race.
