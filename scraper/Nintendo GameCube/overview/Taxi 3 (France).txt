The player takes on the role of the main character of the movie: Daniel, a taxi driver who has an overpowered customized car. Gameplay is simple: in a pursuit view Daniel has a limited time to go to assigned checkpoints to get objects and clients, and go to another checkpoint to drop them... Daniel needs to stop at gas stations to refuel his tank, and can use nitro to get an acceleration bonus. Furthermore Daniel needs to avoid other vehicles in the traffic, such as motorbikes, cars and trucks.
