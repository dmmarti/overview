You play a young Pok�mon Trainer in the Orre Region, two years after the events of Pok�mon Colosseum.  An evil organization has been kidnapping Pok�mon and shutting the door to their hearts in order to turn them into Shadow Pok�mon, built only to attack. 

While trying to complete the research on the Purify Chamber (an invention that is supposed to restore the Shadow Pok�mon to their original state), Prof. Krane was kidnapped by the evil-doers.

With Eevee by your side, you must rescue Prof. Krane while "snagging" any Shadow Pok�mon you come across and opening the door to their hearts.

Pok�mon XD, like its predecessors, is an RPG game with turn-based battles.  What makes it different from previous Pok�mon games is that it features a more interesting and developed story with many characters to meet and interact as well as locations to explore.  

This game also includes combat-mode where you can battle against 1 or 3 other players.
