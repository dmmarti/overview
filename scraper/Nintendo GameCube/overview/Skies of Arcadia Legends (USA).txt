Skies of Arcadia: Legends is a re-release of Skies of Arcadia, a well-known RPG for the Dreamcast. Two young pirates, Vyse and Aika, encounter on their journey a mysterious young girl named Fina. They decide to accompany her on her quest to gather six moon crystals. But it appears that Fina was not the only one looking for those crystals. The evil Valuan empire, lead by an ambitious warlock Galcian and his admirals, will do anything to stop Fina and her brave friends...

The gameplay is largely based on world-map traveling (always in an airship), visiting various countries, and fighting in two modes: traditional party-based combat, and ship battles, where you control an entire ship and assign commands for four turns.

What's new in this GameCube re-release? Graphics have been improved (especially character graphics), there are new sub-quests, and new characters with background stories which tell us more about the past of the game's heroes.
