The backstory has the events of the game set in December 2006, as the castle of the title appears in the sky above Tokyo. In the beginning of the story, a giant castle appeared from above the city of Tokyo sometime during 2006. At 40 km, the ship-shaped castle was known as Nejireta castle. The battle between mankind and the gods is about to begin.Each character has a primary weapon, used by tapping or holding one firing button; holding the button for more than a few seconds, however, will switch to the character's secondary "Shikigami" weapon. This tends to be more powerful, but limited in range or utility, and also slows character movement. Each character's weapons are different, sometimes dramatically, in terms of pattern and power; in addition, each Shikigami weapon is available in one of two modes, chosen at the start of each new game. Bombs are also available, and each character's bombs function differently as well.
