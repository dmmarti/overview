Released in Japan in January 2003, this Taito-developed action game is a two-player shooter where players must take on a major alien bug infestation within the crumbling walls of a post-apocalyptic city. Sounds a bit like an obvious sequel to Space Invaders, but the gameplay is actually more akin to 3D on-rails shooters like Sin and Punishment. The game highlights the conflicts of the usual glamorous heroes -- a beautiful girl that's keen on riding motorcycles, the overzealous frat boy, and the super macho ex-army commandant. All go up against a host of nasty alien creatures, including beetle like bugs and flying creatures.
