Introducing Chibi-Robo, the four inch high rechargeable robot whose sole purpose is to make its owners happy!  Accompanied by its  talkative guide Telly Vision, Chibi-Robo makes its way through the dysfunctional Sanderson household, trying its best to make the family members happy.  It won't be easy though - their daughter thinks she's a frog, the wife is furious at the husband for wasting money and makes him sleep on the couch, and if that wasn't enough, there are reports of spider-like robots out to destroy Chibi-Robo!

Chibi-Robo! is a platform adventure game with a difference - players control a small robot called Chibi-Robo, whose short size means that regular objects like furniture and stairs become gargantuan obstacles for it to overcome.  Its battery is consistently draining while not plugged into a wall outlet, and its power consumption increases when it uses tools like its blaster, copter or radar.  Because of this, players must keep an eye on their remaining power and regularly recharge.

The aim of the game is to earn "Happy Points" to increase Chibi-Robo's rank and become "Super Chibi-Robo".  It can do this by performing simple tasks (such as throwing away trash or cleaning floor stains like muddy footprints) or by making its owners happy, such as giving a rose as a gift to Jenny, the frog-obsessed daughter.
