The Timesplitters series returns with a hair-raising flight across time to discover the origin of the Timesplitters in an effort to turn the tides of the war that is ripping apart mankind.  The final game in the Timesplitters trilogy, Timesplitters: Future Perfect picks up right where Timespliters 2 left off: in the cockpit of Cortez's escape ship.  Cortez soon begins a race through time in order to find out the origins of the Timesplitters.  As Cortez investigates strange happenings at a Scottish castle, he soon begins unraveling the mystery of the Timesplitters. Cortez crosses paths with the creepy, the weird, the downright funny, and even multiple versions of himself as he blazes across time leaving a ruined space-time continuum in his wake.  Cortez soon finds out that he may have more to do with the creation of the Timesplitters than he thinks!
