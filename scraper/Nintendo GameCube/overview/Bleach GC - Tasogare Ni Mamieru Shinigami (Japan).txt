Based on the popular Japanese manga/anime series "Bleach", Sega honors all Gamecube™ fans with release of a cel-shaded 2D fighting game. The game features one on one battles with a character selection of around 25 fighters, including Ichigo, Renji and many more.   Beach's battle system is easy to pick up, with two basic attack buttons (weak & strong) as well as the ability to block and jump. While blocking and tapping up/down, you can further dodge attacks.   Additional key points are chain combos as well as the "Bankai mode", which allows you to slow down time and damage your opponent.
