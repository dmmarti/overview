The Naruto series follows Shonen Jump, a popular manga series and television show in Japan. Seeing as the show centers on students at a Ninja Academy, the translation to a 2D fighting game seems logical. Gekitou Ninja Taisen 3 will introduce some new characters, such as a female ninja named Temari and the hardened ninja master Jiraiva. Thereï¿½s also a chubby character named Chouji. As in the show, Gekitou Ninja Taisen 3 splits characters into groups of three. Returning characters Ino and Shikamaru join newcomer Chouji in Team Konoha, while Team Sand is made up of newbie Temari and old characters Kankuro and Gaara. As in the last installment, Gekitou Ninja Taisen 3 boasts a four-player fighting mode.
