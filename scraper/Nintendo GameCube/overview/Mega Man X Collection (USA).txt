Mega Man X Collection contains seven of the Blue Bomber's games on one disc.  Contained in this collection are Mega Man X, Mega Man X2, the enhanced version of Mega Man X3 with anime cutscenes and remixed music, Mega Man X4, Mega Man X5, and Mega Man X6.  Each game now features customizable controls as well as the option to save, but Mega Man X 1 to 3 retain their password option as well.  The games also feature less slowdown as well as shorter loading times for the later games.

Mega Man X Collection also features Mega Man Battle and Chase as a bonus unlockable game.  This game, previously only released in Europe and Japan, is a kart racer similar to Mario Kart, with a Mega Man twist in that you can steal opponents' vehicle parts and apply them to your own kart.

There are also bonus unlockables for the players to discover as they complete games in the collection, including game artwork and sketches, remixes of various in-game music, and game hints.
