You play in a fictional world, where war has erupted between the Frontiers and the Tundrans.  You are ordered to command the Frontiers to victory.  Using your troops you can command them to attack, defend, and follow you, as well as garrison them in bunkers, capture bases, and hop in vehicles.  You can switch between a first-person view, and control one of your men to lead in battle, or you can use the top-down view, where you have a good view of the battlefield.  Through an expansive campaign, a number of different nations, and a garrison that would impress even Napoleon, you can see just how fun war may be.
