This is the first multiplayer game in the Rayman series. It's no jump and run as the other Rayman franchises were - here, you race against your friend or battle him in the arena. These battles are of course child-friendly - you must collect five glowing spheres before the other player does. 

Go at it in mind-bending races courses, or square off head to head in the battle arena. Use your speed in 12 race courses where you must take risks, use tricks, and trip up your opponents as you run, slide, climb, and helicopter for the checkered flag. You can freeze the other player for a few seconds by shooting him with an ice beam. 

For these battles, 12 different maps are included. Knockout your opponent with power-ups, traps, and special ammo, and four-player action - splitscreen on consoles, over the internet on PC.

You can unlock rewards such as bonus levels, additional modes, character skins, and new characters by beating the best times and highest scores.
