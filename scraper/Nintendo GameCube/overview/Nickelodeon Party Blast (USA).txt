Following in the footsteps of Mario Party and Sonic Shuffle comes Nickelodeon Party, a part game collection of five mini-games designed for four-player action. Before entering single- or multiplayer competition, players can choose from eight NickToons characters: SpongeBob SquarePants, Jimmy Neutron, Invader Zim, Otto Rocket, Reggie Rocket, Angelica Pickles, Tommy Pickles, and Eliza Thornberry.  Game modes include Blast, a 25-event contest for solo players; Replay, where any of the unlocked mini-games can be played separately; Cup Challenge, which consists of two tournaments; and the multiplayer Party Play.
