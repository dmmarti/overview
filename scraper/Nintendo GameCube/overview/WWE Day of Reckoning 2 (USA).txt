In this sequel to WWE Day of Reckoning there are 45 wrestlers to choose from. The game has a new and longer story mode as well as continuations of the story lines from the first game. You can also create your own wrestlers and put them in the story mode.  The graphics and the fighting system have been improved. Bret Hart and Hulk Hogan join the roster as Legends. The game has some strategy elements which is unusual the wrestling game genre. The gameplay is revolved around stamina rather than just a general energy level. If all stamina is gone, the player won't be able to control the wrestler. In addition, players can perform up to four unique submission moves. The game is also very bloody, ranging from a small cut on the forehead, to a face full of blood and blood on the chest. Blood also drips onto the mat and stays there. A new type of match called The Last Man Standing is included in this game. This is similar to being knocked out but being counted out while stunned. The Create-A-Wrestler feature has returned for this game and is used for story mode.
