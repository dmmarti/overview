Kirby's adventures takes him into new territory in this race through the stars. Control Kirby and various other characters from the franchise through the tracks (ranging from star fields to Mario like kingdoms) simply by using the analog stick.

Kirby can also use various special moves, such as attacks on the other racers to slow them down. 4 players can take to the track at any time, controlling a different colored Kirby.
