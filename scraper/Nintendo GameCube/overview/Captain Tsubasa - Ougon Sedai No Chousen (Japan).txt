Captain Tsubasa is a football game that follows the style of Tecmo Cup. Just like the Japanese version of Tecmo Cup, it is based on the anime series that narrate the adventures of the young Tsubasa, from his beginnings in the Nankatsu team, till the end of the National Championship, where he will compete against his biggest rival in the series, Kojro Hyuga, star striker of the Meiwa.  During matches, you will see an animation of the player you control, and below him a map that indicates the locations of all players competing, your position being highlighted. If no rival appears in your way, you will have total freedom to advance to the rival goal, and when you find it appropriate, stop the game in order to make an action, and then it will appear a menu asking you if you want to pass, shoot or make a special move (depending on how high your guts counter is).
