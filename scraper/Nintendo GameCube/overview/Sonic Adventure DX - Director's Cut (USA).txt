An updated version of the Sega Dreamcast hit Sonic Adventure, the first appearance of Sonic and the crew in a full 3D action title.

Once again Sonic is up against Dr. Eggman, who had teamed up with Chaos for the ultimate opportunity to take over the world. Tails, Knuckles and Amy join in on the action, along with a host of new characters and enemies.

The GameCube version includes a brand new mission mode, a new Chaos Garden link up mode to the Game Boy Advance, and a host of mini-games including appearances of classic Game Gear Sonic adventures such as Tails' Skypatrol.
