You have been chosen to join the reckoning -- you are to step into the World of Darkness where humanity is ravaged by vampires and marauding monsters.  As a Hunter, you are immune to these beasts' illusions, but with your power comes a daunting destiny: to destroy these evil beings before mankind is massacred.

Hunter takes place over 23 different stages in which you and up to three of your friends can wield up to twenty different weapons against a horde of enemies.  Each player chooses from one of four classes: the Avenger, Martyr, Defender or the Judge.  Each one possesses different strengths and weaknesses along with their own individual set of spells.  Gameplay can very much be compared to the Gauntlet games, where you face innumerable odds while building up your own characters in order to take down the ultimate evil.
