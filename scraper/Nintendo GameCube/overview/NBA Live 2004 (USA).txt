It's another season of the NBA, and with it comes another edition of NBA Live.

For 2004, the player can expect an expanded EA Sports Freestyle control scheme, allowing the player to pull off plays by simply using the right analog stick in collaboration with the player's  movement with the left analog stick. Dynasty mode has also been upgraded, with the opportunity of expanding the player's squad with the top free agents and rookies from the college leagues.

Up to 4 players can play on the Xbox, while PlayStation 2 players can go online with full stat tracking.
