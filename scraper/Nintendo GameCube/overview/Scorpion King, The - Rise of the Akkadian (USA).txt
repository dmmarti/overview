This 3-D combat adventure chronicles the future Scorpion King's first adventure, a long and arduous quest to thwart an evil lord's diabolical plan to raise a supernatural army of beast-warriors to conquer the world. Players will wield multiple attack combinations against enemies. The action takes place in breathtaking vistas of ancient Egypt.
