Puzzle Bobble meets the Worms universe in what could be one of the wildest crossovers ever made. The main goal of the game is still the same, to burst the bubbles, however this time instead of featuring little and cute dinosaurs, Worms Blast introduces battle-hardened worms or explosive sheep angry for points, battling up on boats.

Fortunately, Worms Blast is not just a mere copycat of Puzzle Bobble with cell-shaded graphics. Team 17 have made numerous changes to the gameplay, which make playing the game quite a different experience.
Along others, these change include the ability to actually move your character or to shoot on the other player, different kinds of weapons and a load of varied gameplay modes. The main change to the game is probably the fact that you're no longer firing bubbles, but missiles that color them on impact.
