Home Run King is an MLB-licensed baseball game released exclusively for the GameCube. Designed more as a pick-up-and-play game than a detailed simulation, it offers fast-paced gameplay and a basic selection of modes.  Modes include Exhibition, Season, Playoffs and Home Run Derby. The game features team customization and player creation and trading. Players will control all aspects of play: pitching, batting, fielding and running.  The pitching interface features a pitch type selector that displays the pitches available to the current player as lines whose length indicates their effectiveness. Pitches are selected by moving the control stick in the appropriate direction, and then pressing the appropriate button for normal, slow or fast pitches or pick-off throws. A timing gauge must be stopped at the maximum point for best results.  The batting interface reuses the pitch type selector, this time for predicting the pitch that is thrown. A batting cursor must be moved to meet the incoming ball to hit it. If the correct pitch was predicted, the cursor is larger and makes hitting easier. Bunts as well as normal, power and contact swings are possible.  During fielding, an icon indicates the ball's height and position, and the A button can be pressed to make a super play: diving or sliding after the ball. Before the pitch is made, runners can be made to increase their lead for an attempted steal. Running is otherwise automatic, with only the destination base selectable.
