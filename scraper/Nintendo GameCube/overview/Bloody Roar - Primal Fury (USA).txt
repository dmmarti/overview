A conversion of the PlayStation 2 3D beat 'em up Bloody Roar 3, Primal Fury adds new characters, arenas and special attack moves for each previous character from BR3. Improvements are also made in graphical lighting and textures, plus added music tracks.

The same control style and gameplay seen in the original three Bloody Roar titles is here, where at a touch of a button your character can morph into beasts of increased strength and ability during play. Smash through breakable arenas and perform devastating combo attacks to defeat the enemy, or a friend in two player mode.
