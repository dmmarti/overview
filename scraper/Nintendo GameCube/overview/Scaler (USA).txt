Bobby Jenkins lives next door to Leon a scientist on the verge of discovering a device that can stabilize and control portals that connect the planets within the multiple universes. Leon is transported to weird dimension during his experiments where the evil Looger and his cohorts steal the portal travel technology and uses it to break into our world to perfect the technology. Once here, they are discovered by Bobby who is captured and questioned about Leon�s work.  Bobby manages to escape and is teleported to their world where the story takes place.

Scaler is an action platform game in which you control Bobby Jenkins who turns to Scaler in the �bizarre dimension� and tries to stop the evil Looger and his cronies. Along your adventure you will come across friends and foes like Leon who gives you advice and guidance and �Captain Bootcamp� who is Looger�s right hand lackey. Travel through 15 colorful levels riding vines and crawling walls as you hunt and defeat Looger and his team. 

Scaler has lots of abilities like climbing walls to reach new areas and riding vines to charge up your electric bomb attack. Use camouflage to sneak by deadly traps and confuse your enemies. Attack with your tongue or use your claw attack, which you can upgrade during the game. Use the Electric Bomb attack several enemies at once. Scaler can transform into some of the enemies he defeats after defeating enough of them and use the special abilities of that creature.

Break open cocoons and shells to collect Klokkies and Crystal Gems which in turn can be used to get new abilities and upgrade existing ones. If you collect 100 Crystal Gems in the game you will get an alternate ending. Collect Lizard Eggs to unlock more levels and to keep Looger form mutating them into monsters.

The intuitive menu system lets you set options like camera view (first or third) and rotation (normal or inverted), audio and vibration. The pause menu lets you save your game, see your objectives and the ones you have finished, check your status screen (number of collectables you have, energy points earned, number of transformable creatures you have defeated, transformations you have mastered and abilities you have learned), display current level map and see a world map and a picture gallery. As you collect more Crystal Gems more pictures will become available.
