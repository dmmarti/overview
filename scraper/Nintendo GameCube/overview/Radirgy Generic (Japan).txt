Radirgy is a vertical-screen top-down bullet-hell shooter originally developed by Milestone for Naomi arcade system and later released on Dreamcast.
Setting itself apart from many other top-down shooters on the system, the game features bright, cartoony, cell-shaded graphics. At the beginning, the player is given a choice of three different mecha-ships - one with a spread-gun, a weak homing laser, or a slow but powerful bubble gun. Additionally, each ship can use a sword for anything that gets too close, or specific enemies which can't be killed otherwise, a shield, which appears at the front of the ship once the player lets go of the fire button, and a smart-bomb-like field that can be extended around the player  in a small circle, damaging enemies, absorbing their shots and turning them into points.
