Aliens have invaded earth, bringing with them a collection of deadly monsters bent on destruction of the land they stand on. You must destroy each of the beasts and send the aliens packing, while also looking after yourself from the humans who want all beasts dead.

Choose from a host of classic Godzilla monsters including the 90's and 2000 version of the beast himself plus Megalon,  Anguirus, King Ghidorah, Gigan, Rodan, Mecha-King Ghidorah, Destroyah and Mechagodzilla.

Battle in a range of modes including Adventure (destroy each of the beasts in turn in a collection of city locations), Destruction (destroy the city as much as you can), Survival (defeat as many beasts as possible on one health bar), Team Battle (beasts pair up into teams to tackle each other) and the multiplayer 'Melee' mode where up to four players can battle it out as their fav monster.
