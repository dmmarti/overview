3DO brings the colorful robot battles of the Cubix: Robots for Everyone cartoon series to the Nintendo GameCube. In Cubix Robots for Everyone: Showdown, players can try to save Bubble Town in the single-player adventure or have at it in various multiplayer modes. Robots throughout the town have gone haywire. Usually helpful and obedient, they're now bent on destruction. It's up to Connor, Abbey, and the rest of the Cubix gang to round up the robots before Dr. K and his robot Kolossal. In the Story Mode, you will come face-to-face with huge robots in strategic turn-based battles. Between battles you will be faced with minor puzzle-solving. As Connor, you will jump, push blocks, and search all over Bubble Town to find important items like batteries, diagnostics, and Emotion Processing Units (EPUs) that grant your robots new abilities.
