A complete compilation of 7 classic Genesis Sonic the Hedgehog title.

1. Sonic the Hedgehog: Sonic's first ever outing had you controlling the speedy blue hedgehog through level after level of loops, spins, traps and enemies, as you take on Dr. Robotnik.

2. Sonic the Hedgehog 2: The second Sonic title continues the neverending battle against Dr. Robotnik, while introducing a side kick for Sonic, Tails (who has the ability to fly using his two tails) and a 2 player mode.

3. Sonic the Hedgehog 3: Sonic and Tails are now up against Knuckles, who also wants the Chaos Emeralds along with Dr. Robotnik.

4. Sonic & Knuckles: An update of Sonic 3 introduces players to Knuckles as a playable character, with the ability to climb up walls, punch enemies and glide through the air.

5. Sonic 3D Blast: Away from the usual side-scrolling Sonic, this Marble Madness style psuedo-3D title has you chasing Robotnik once again, and collecting the usual assortment of rings and bonuses.

6. Sonic Spinball: It's Sonic stuck in a pinball machine, with the simple aim of defeating the great Dr. while making major high scores by flicking the ball like Sonic through-out the tables.

7. Dr.Robotnikï¿½s Mean Bean Machine: The Doc has a problem of his own this time, as you play a Tetris style puzzle game, matching the beans to clear them from the screen.

Also on the disc is the complete history of Sonic and his world, a full magazine from the Sonic comic book series, cover art, and hidden games. These include the secret games &quot;Knuckles in Sonic 2&quot; and the &quot;Blue Sphere&quot; hidden levels, as well as the Genesis games Flicky and Ristar. The Japanese version also has the Genesis (MegaDrive) games The Ooze and Comix Zone that the other region releases do not have.
