NBA 2K2 is the third game in SEGA's NBA 2K series of basketball simulations. This is the first game in the series to be released for multiple platforms (instead of solely for the Dreamcast). In addition to updated graphics, rosters, arenas, team uniforms, and signature moves for the 2001-2002 season, the 2K2 edition now supports zone defenses (a new NBA rule where you have to choose to play man or zone defense), intercepting of passes, and making adjustments and actions in mid-animation.

There are detailed statistics for each team and player, for a year, the current season or an entire career. The game modes include Exhibition, Season (play a full season along with management), Franchise (more than one season), some arcade street modes and the option to create custom tournaments.
