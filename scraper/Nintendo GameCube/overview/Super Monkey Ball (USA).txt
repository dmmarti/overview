You play as one of four monkeys, each one trapped inside a transparent ball.  You are tasked with completing various objectives by tilting the game level, resulting in your monkey "rolling" forward or backward.  There are 100 stages, ranging from easy to impossible.

There are also various mini-games for you to unlock, such as Monkey Billiards and Monkey Bowling.
