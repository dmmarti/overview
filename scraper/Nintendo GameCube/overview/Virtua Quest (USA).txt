Unlike other entries in the series, this latest VF game takes the form of an Action-RPG title rather than a versus fighter. There's fighting included as well, although it takes the form of 3rd person street brawls with your character facing off against multiple enemies. Cyber Generation takes place in the near future in the floating city of Acropolis and inside the virtual realm called the Nexus -- a young kid stumbles across a conspiracy inside the online realm, and now must fight to save himself and his world. Luckily, data of the legendary fighters from the classic Virtua Fighter tournaments has made it into the Nexus stream, and by studying from these masters in the online realm, he'll have the skills to defeat the enemy!
