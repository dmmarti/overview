Fourteen years after its debut, PC Genjin (Bonk's Adventure) is remade as the third game out of four in the Hudson Selection series of game remakes. While the game remains mostly the same as the original, the graphics and sound have been completely overhauled. The graphics are fully 3D rendered and are similar in design to Yoshi's Story. Bonk has a meaner look and practically every sound effect is spelled out on-screen. Some of the levels are altered. Fruit is not as common and there are no crystal hearts, but lives are much more plentiful. There are three difficulty levels, which after being fully completed, unlock the three original PC Genjin Japanese TV commercials.
