Beach Spikers is an action beach volleyball game for one to four players. Several modes of gameplay are included: arcade (a conversion of the arcade game), world tour (the player creates a team, develops a relationship with their partner to increase her ability, and aims to be the world champs), vs mode (play against other players or the cpu) and a tutorial mode. Several mini-games are also featured, such as beach countdown where teams play volleyball with a bomb and hope it doesn't explode on their side of the net, and beach flags where the player needs to capture a flag before their opponent.

Beach Spikers comes with a number of predefined teams, or the player can create their own team from a variety of female athletes. Each character can be customized in appearance as well, from hair and skin color to uniform.
