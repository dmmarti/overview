Evolution Skateboarding has features that are brand-new in the extreme sports game genre. Players skate across eight sprawling fantasy levels that are 200 percent larger than the levels seen in Konami’s previous skateboarding titles, and gameplay is enriched by intense boss battles that must be completed to progress through the game. Players will come face-to-face with a giant spider and a runaway truck as they grind their way to the next level. Topping off the game’s rich feature set are in-game tools that allow players to design their own stunts and skaters.
