Another licensed title by EA, based on the movie with the same name, starring Halle Berry. The game follows the film's plot and its models and graphics are based upon the respective characters and locations as seen in the movie. Halle Berry also lends her voice to the character, aside from her likeness.

Catwoman has an impressive array of powers at her disposal with which to overcome obstacles and fight her enemies. The gameplay is split between overcoming obstacles using Catwoman's agility and whip, and defeating (but not killing) enemies using her abilities and the aforementioned whip, again.
