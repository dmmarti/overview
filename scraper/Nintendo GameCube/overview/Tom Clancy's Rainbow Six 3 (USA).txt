This game is a tactical ops, rescue mission, save the world shooter. You and a team infiltrate an enemy base or as the opposing team guard the enemy base and have a strategic shoot 'em up. The difference between this one and other shooting games is that you get shot once or twice and you're dead. Meaning mission is over. No extra lives, no respawn point. You'll have to wait until the next level (which is usually about 1-5 minutes depending on when you died). The new release boasts high graphics and the same high quality team oriented combat, that the series is known for.
