Neighbors from Hell is a game with strategy, adventure, and puzzle elements. The player controls Woody, a participant in a virtual game show. The player is entertaining the audience with cunning stunts and trickery, which are rewarded with points (multiplied if a succession of tricks can be executed successfully). The more fiendish tricks Woody chains together, the more infuriated his evil neighbor Joe becomes. The player must prepare these tricks and traps across fourteen episodes, based on Joe's movement patterns. Graphics are cartoon-style and lean towards humour.
