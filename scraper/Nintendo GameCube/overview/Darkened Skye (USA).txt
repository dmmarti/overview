The Skittles brand candies "Taste the Rainbow" ad campaign is the inspiration behind this action adventure game in which the tasty, brightly-colored orbs are transformed into magical spheres with tremendous powers.

You play Skye of Lynlora, a "sexy Warrior-Hero-Adventurer-Goddess with a smart mouth" whose mundane life as a Dwentil shepherdess is changed forever when she comes upon one of the magical Skittles while following a stray dwentil.  It is up to Skye to reassemble the Great Rainbow which has been squelched by the evil Lord Necroth.  Armed with her sense of humor and trusty staff, harness the power of the Skittles to defeat Necroth�s minions, solve ancient mysteries and ultimately save the world.

As the witty, and often sarcastic, Skye, you�ll be running, jumping and battling your way across graphically beautiful, medieval lands depicted in 3-dimensional detail.  The story and plot unfold gradually as you meet numerous, unique non-player characters and solve many puzzles along the way.
