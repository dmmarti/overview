The sequel to the first game preserves the original gameplay and adds some new features. Supporting the DK Bongos input device, you have to hit one drum, the other, both or clap when the cursor passes the corresponding icon, to match the rhythm. You score points when the timing is right.

Familiar characters from the Donkey Kong series make an appearance and there are 25 new songs of different genres, from J-pop to dance and hip-hop. The main drumming mode is limited to two players, but up to four players can play together in the mini-games. In the street performance mode, you earn coins that can be exchanged at the shopping mall for expert music, new sound sets and mini-games. In the other modes, you can go freestyle, match a set performance score to play all the game's songs in one sitting or battle against an opponent in regular games or drum roll contests.

There are two versions of the game, one with the DK Bongos included and a low-priced version without the device.
