In Pokémon Channel, you along with a wild Pikachu are test viewers for a new pokémon television channel. As the game progresses, more channels will become available to you. You can also win money, buy merchandise, and visit other places on the poké-plentiful island you watch all this T.V. on. A major plot point in the game is a missing episode of the Pichu anime series; Part 5 will have to be found.
