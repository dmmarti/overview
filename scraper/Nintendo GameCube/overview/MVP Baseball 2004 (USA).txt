Step up to the plate for the second iteration of EA Sports' MVP Baseball.  You can sim, manage, or play your way through 120 years of your MLB, AAA and AA franchise.  Manage and play as all three teams - develop your farm and win the World Series - even the Tigers have a chance!  Two mini-modes let you play head to head with friends or the CPU to test your batting and pitching skills.  You can also play in classic fields using classic players like Babe Ruth and Jackie Robinson.  Hundreds of uniforms to choose from and thousands of animations to bring the players to life.
