Ultimate Muscle: Legends vs. New Generation is a wrestling game based on the Kinnikuman anime series. The mechanics of the game are clearly arcade in its realization, as they intend to emulate the spectacularity of the anime. This is specially experienced through the special moves, attacks that can be executed when a specific bar hits the top, which in many cases allow you to have your rival projected to the air and still be able to apply him a lock before he hits the ground. Regarding playable fighters, this game combines 20 characters from both the oldest and newer seasons of the series, among them: Kid Muscle, Terry Kenyon, Wally Tusket, Checkmate, Dik Dik Van Dik, Kevin Mask, Jeager, King Muscle, Sunshine, Ramenman, Buffaloman, Terryman, Brocken Jr, etc; plus 10 more, who are &quot;guests&quot; unrelated to the anime series. Other notable aspect of the game is the power-ups: items thrown by your team partner or the manager himself, that among many things can increase your energy or special bars, but also injure your opponents.
