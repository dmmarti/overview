The first game in the Outlaw series of sports titles, Outlaw Golf is what you get when you take the classic game of golf and throw in lesbian strippers, wannabe rappers, ex cons and other wild personalities.  The game has a bad attitude chock full of sexual themes and language that puts Happy Gilmore to shame.

Outlaw Golf pits you as one of ten over-the-top golfing personalities (paired with equally over-the-top caddies) to compete in over 30 different tour events from where you attempt to unlock new characters, better clubs and balls as well as improving your golfer's skills along the way with 12 different mini-games.  The game also sports a composure response system, which simply means that when you do well, the game is easier and when you aren't doing so well you will find your shots not going exactly where you want them. Composure too low? Beat up your caddy and you can relieve some of that stress to regain your lost composure. Multiplayer supports 8 different game modes, including stroke play, match play, skins, best ball and casino with up to four players.
