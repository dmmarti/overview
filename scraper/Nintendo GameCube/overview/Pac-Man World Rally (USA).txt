A kart-race game with Pac-Man and other characters from previous Pac-Man games and other Namco franchises. For instance the PlayStation Portable version features Mr. Driller, Mappy and the Prince from Katamari Damacy .

The game is packed with not only the traditional Dots to consume and enemies to avoid, but also with power-ups and temporary advantages which players should use strategically to win the race and beat opponents. One example is a power slide to turn corners at full speed. Of course, enemies can also be bitten after eating a Power Pellet.
