You can choose your futuristic car, but this doesn't really matter. Only your drive skills.

Now you can try a game which is made after the racing vision of Formula 1 champion, Jacques Villeneuve and challenge other people over the Internet on Speed Challenge League.
 
You have enough of circuit racing? You can test your drive abilities on actual streets of great cities (Paris, London, Montreal...) too.

New gaming features includes: Autopilot, Car Auto-Repair, the Target.

The game is based on Ubi Soft's REVENGE ENGINE which can handle 70,000 polygons per track, allowing realistic car models managing over 60 parameters, providing the player with unique and intense driving sensations !
