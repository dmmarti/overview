Future Tactics: The Uprising is a turn-based tactical game by developer Zed Two. The world of Pillage has been taken over by alien creatures and the player has to stop this, taking the role of Low and his little sister Pepper, along with other characters they meet along the way. 

The battle system in Future Tactics combines tactics with a little bit of reflexes. By firing a gun you have to play some sort of mini game. The better you play, the more accurate your shot will be. Future Tactics uses cartoon-like 3D graphics with completely deformable terrain.
