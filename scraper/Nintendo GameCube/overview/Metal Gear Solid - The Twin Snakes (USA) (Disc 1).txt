The Twin Snakes is a remake of the 1998 Playstation tactical espionage action game Metal Gear Solid.

You assume the role of a former member of a special military organization FOXHOUND, going by the codename Solid Snake. After the events described in the two Metal Gear games, Snake decided to retire and to live in solitude in Alaska. However, the US government needs him once again. A terrorist organization led by former FOXHOUND members threatens to fire a nuclear bomb if the government does not hand to them the remains of Big Boss, the "legendary soldier" who was once their commander. Solid Snake is sent to infiltrate the terrorists' base, to rescue the scientists kept there, and to find a way to destroy the unknown nuclear weapon. There is another consideration that makes Solid Snake interested in the case: the leader of the terrorists bears the codename Liquid Snake and looks very similar to the special agent...

The Twin Snakes has the same story and dialogues as the original (although voice-overs were re-recorded for this release). The locations in the game also remained the same, but the graphics were updated to look equal in quality to contemporary games. Gameplay was also enhanced, featuring the additions that first appeared in Metal Gear Solid 2. Snake can now roll, hang from ledges, hide in lockers, drag guards' bodies away, as well as aim and shoot from first-person view. New weapons from Metal Gear Solid 2 (such as tranquilizer gun) are also present. Another noticeable change is in the game's cut scenes. Directed by the Japanese action movie director Ryuhei Kitamura, the cut scenes have a certain Matrix feel, featuring slow motion and other effects.
