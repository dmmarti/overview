The TMNT are back once again to fight shredder. It has the same look and control scheme as the previous 2 games. Also, like the previous game it is a beat-em up action game. You can play the game with up to 3 friends. The game has a few different missions as turtles fight Triceratons in order to find the missing Fugitoid and prevent their siege on Earth. All 4 turtles can be on screen at the same time. With the other turtles you can make teamed up group attacks to attack a target and perform special moves. In addition there is an ultimate turtle mode, where your turtle will become temporarily invincible and be able to blow through lots of enemies easily. By gathering special items like crystals, you can upgrade your turtles, giving them new techniques and special moves.
