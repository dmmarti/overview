Ever wanted to catch a fish with your Playstation 2? Well, now is your chance. Throw in the line and see if you can catch a Largemouth Bass or Redeye, then follow the split screen action. One side shows you and the other the underwater life. Then, with a fish on the line, madly press the buttons to pull him in, and watch the fish try to evade capture on the screen.

Features include weather effects (rain, wind, etc.), different river conditions on each level, campaign modes where you can win prizes as you go along and improve your stature as a Top Angler, and much more.
