Star Fox Adventures is a sequel to the Star Fox series, following Star Fox on the SNES and Star Fox 64 on the Nintendo 64.

Fox McCloud returns and is given a different mission than he is normally used to. At the far edge of the Lylat system, an evil army, led by General Scales, is destroying the world of Dinosaur Planet, rendering all its inhabitants helpless. It is now up to Fox McCloud and his team to save the planet and destroy the evil army.

SFA breaks away from the previous games, for the game is a third person action/adventure game in the vein of Tomb Raider. You control Fox McCloud as he adventures through Dinosaur Planet, but at the beginning, you control Krystal, who Fox must later rescue. There are missions where you use your trusty Arwing craft, but the majority of the game takes place on foot.

Helping you throughout your adventure are your trusty sidekicks; Peppy, Slippy, and ROB the Robot, who guide and give you mission briefings.

To aid Fox throughout the game, a variety of weapons and magical items are available from blasters to grenades to magic staffs. You may also purchase items with &quot;scarabs&quot;, the game's currency.

Throughout the game you may partake in various mini-games, which are found at different stores.
