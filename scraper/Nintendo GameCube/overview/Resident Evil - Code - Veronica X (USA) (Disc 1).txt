This is the same as the original BioHazard: Code: Veronica for Dreamcast, with new cut-scenes that were not included in the original.

The game is otherwise almost the same, you still take control of Claire Redfield and Chris Redfield, who are searching for each other, while uncovering the secrets behind the Umbrella Corporation.
