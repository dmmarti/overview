In the third outing of the Splinter Cell series, Third Echelon's most valued operative Sam Fisher becomes once again entangled in a conspiracy-ridden story of international espionage, involving information warfare. An unrelated mission soon leads Sam to a massive conflict between Japan, China and North Korea, where both stealth and brutal actions are required. Improvements over the previous version include new moves, weapons and technology, alternative routes in single-player missions, and improvements to the co-operative and versus multiplayer modes.

The limited collector's edition comes in a metal tin box and has a DVD with extra features including video diaries, Penny Arcade comics, music from the soundtrack, and more.
