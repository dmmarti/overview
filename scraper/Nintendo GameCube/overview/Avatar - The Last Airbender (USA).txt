You play as the characters Aang, Katara, Haru, and Sokka (all characters from the Nickelodeon cartoon of the same name) in this action adventure title. The game follows the context of the cartoon, in which the world is split up into four nations each dedicated to an element; earth, air, water and fire. Your primary character, Aang, is the newest incarnation of the Avatar, capable of mastering all four elements. The adventure of this game takes place between the first and second seasons on the cartoon, and is a completely separate side-story.

As with most games of the action adventure genre, you view the game from a top-down viewpoint and travel around areas fighting monsters and looking for specific items required for quests to progress further through the game. The game unfolds over several chapters, and once you move on from one chapter you cannot backtrack to previous areas.

As your characters levels increase with experience, they will gain new bending powers. Also as you progress through the game you will find new armor and equipment for the playable characters to use.
