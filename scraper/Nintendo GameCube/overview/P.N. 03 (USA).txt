The Computer Arms Management System (CAMS) is the basic form of defense for planets against any enemy. But a terrible accident leaves an entire colony dead, and its up to a human to put an end to the out of control system.

Enter Vanessa Z. Schneider, a freelance mercenary, who has been charged with the task of bringing CAMS under control. But she has another mission in hand: revenge for CAMS destruction of her family.

Control Vanessa through the various landscapes in a 3rd person perspective, using her upgradeable abilities to destroy the CAMS, while dodging fire with a range of acrobatic moves.
