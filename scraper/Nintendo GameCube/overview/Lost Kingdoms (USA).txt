The first RPG for the GameCube. As Princess Katia, you're on a quest to rid the land of a deadly menace intent on engulfing the five Kingdoms of Argwyll. You must find and gather the cards that hold the power to unleash incredible creatures into battle.

If you are familiar with the game Rune, this is basically it for the GameCube.
