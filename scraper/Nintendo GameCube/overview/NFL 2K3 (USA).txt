Sega brings another season of its football game in NFL 2K3.  With new lifelike player animations, new play-calling intelligence, an on-the-fly audible system, and a brand new ESPN broadcast system with the famous overlays, scores, and highlights, it adds a whole new feel to the series. In these days of free agency when championships are won or lost in the front office as well as down on the field, NFL 2K3ï¿½s new Franchise mode gives you total team control as player, coach, and general manager -- track the best players, make the smartest trades, and build the most dominant team in the league. It is complete with all of the updated rosters, NFL alignment changes, and authentic stadiums redesigned in full 3D for the 2002 season.  Also new to the series is online play.
