In Wrestlemania X8 you can choose from one of 35 wrestling super stars! Your wrestlers signature music pumps through the arena, your fans cheer, your opponent's fans boo, and you even watch your own grand entrance on the TitanTron video screen. Whether you want to play as one of wrestling's pros, an up-and-coming rookie, or a self-created superstar wrestler, you can take your character up through the ranks in the quest for the heavyweight belt. To win, you'll need to know your wrestler's style to best use his combination of counters, reversals, and bone-shattering finishing moves. Wrestlemania X8 also includes tag-team matchups, more than 40 match types in six different arenas (no one escapes the Cage!) and a TV-style presentation. Let's get ready to RUMBLE!
