This action, adventure game is an entirely new, three dimensional version of the original game that appeared in 1983 on many platforms. Again, the player gets to play the goofy hero, but courageous knight, Dirk the Daring who is on a quest to save the pretty princess Daphne. The princess was kidnapped by the evil dragon Singe imprisoned in a medieval castle owned by an even more evil wizard called
Mordroc. Now, it's only up to Dirk to use his courage and his quick reflexes to overcome the traps in the castle, if he wants to save the princess and his skin.
