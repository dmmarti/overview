Tony Hawk's Underground 2 is the sixth game in the Tony Hawk series.

As an aspiring pro skater, you're invited to join Tony Hawk in an around-the-world underground skating competition known as the "World Destruction Tour."  It's Team Hawk against Team Bam in a no-holds-barred contest to gain the most points by performing insane stunts and raising havoc in cities all over the world.

THUG 2's story mode basically follows the same formula as THUG, in which you have to complete a number of goals before you can move on to the next city.

Re-introduced into the series is the "Classic Mode" wherein you have 2 minutes to complete as many goals as possible on any of  THUG 2's levels and 6 remade classic levels.

THUG 2 has all-new unlockable characters, vehicles, levels.

All the Create-A-Modes from THUG are present, with the addition of the new Create-A-Graphic mode where you can make your own graffiti design with layers of text and predefined graphics, then use it to "tag up" during gameplay.

THUG 2 supports online play (Playstation 2 only) and 2-player split-screen modes in a variety of new and classic multiplayer games.
