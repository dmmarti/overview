Wordmaze is a word guessing game where the player has to escape from a maze. The player is presented with a first person view of the maze and a meter showing how far he is from the exit. To move the player has to complete Hangman-like puzzles where he has to guess words by inputting one letter at a time. For each puzzle there is a bomb that will go off if too many wrong letters are entered. When successful with a puzzle the player is awarded points and automatically moves toward the exit. When failing the player has to choose left or right at the next crossroads which will either lead closer to the exit or further away from it. There is also a time limit as the player has to get to the exit before his oxygen runs out.
