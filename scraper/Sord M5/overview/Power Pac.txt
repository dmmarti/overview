Look. Up on the screen! It's a lemon! It's a U.F.O.! No, it's Super Pac-Man! Fighting his way through maze after maze, Super Pac-Man is in search of truth, justice and a snack. Disguised as a mild-mannered Pac-Man, Super Pac-Man roams the maze searching for keys to unlock stores of goodies while evil goblins attempt to foil his plans. As he munches super energy pills, he's instantly transformed into a super-strong dot of steel, able to smash through goblins and save the day.
Faster than a speeding goblin, able to gobble gobs of goodies in a single swoop, it's Super Pac-Man--the most challenging Pac-Man game yet!
