"Inspired" by the ZX Spectrum game of the same name (also known as Leggit), Jumping Jack has you jumping upwards on a screen consisting of 8 floors so that you may reach the top of the screen. This may sound easy, but you may time your jumps to the moving holes in the platforms, or you will bump your head in the roof. While waiting for the next hole on the platform above, another one may come on the one you're standing on â€” or several at once, from several directions. Falling into a hole drops you to the platform below, knocking you out for a few seconds. If you're unlucky, another hole comes while you lay there. On higher levels, you must also watch out for balls rolling across the platforms.
