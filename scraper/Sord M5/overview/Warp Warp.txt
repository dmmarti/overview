In this game you 're in control of a monster fighter. A warp zone is set in the middle of the screen. Warp to the next level when it flashes. You should attack the monsters before they catch or shoot you. A frog turns up occasionally, shoot it for bonuses. The monsters become more vicious when they change color (they turn from yellow to red to purple). The red and the purple monsters are severe chasers.
