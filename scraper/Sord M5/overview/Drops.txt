Drops is a simple arcade game where you control a bucket, picking up rain drops from a cloud. Only the extra large drops can be picked up, and one of the challenges is to spot these drops in the middle of a heavy rain. As well, the cloud will sometimes release a thunderbolt which must be avoided. When the bucket is filled, the sun shows for a while, and the game progresses to a higher difficulty level.
