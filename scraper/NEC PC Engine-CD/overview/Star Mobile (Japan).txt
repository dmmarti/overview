 Star Mobile is a real-time puzzle game. A large scale is displayed on the screen, and stars continuously fall on it from above. The goal is to move the stars horizontally as they are falling in such a way that the weight on the scale is balance. Each stage contains a set amount of stars required for the player to handle. Stars come in different colors that represent their weight. Both right and left side of the scale contain several spots where the stars can land. If there are too many stars on the same spot, they will fall down, greatly decreasing the weight on the side they were in.
