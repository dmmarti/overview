 Pop 'n Magic is a platformer with single-screen stages, similar in concept to Bubble Bobble. Demons have attacked a lovely floating island, defeated its guardian, and stole the crystals that protected it. Two young magicians, Anis and Lester, decide to put an end to monster invasion. Players can choose to control either of them in single-player mode, or join forces in co-op gameplay. Like in Bubble Bobble, the goal is to eliminate all the enemies on screen by turning them into bubbles; this is achieved by shooting projectiles at them from a magic wand. These bubbles can be destroyed with the wand or thrown at each other for a more effective result. Each monster, however, turns into a bubble of a particular color, and making two bubbles of the same color touch each other releases the trapped monsters. If it takes the player too long to kill all the enemies, tougher ones will appear on screen. The game consists of six worlds, each comprising nine regular and one boss stage.
