 Sylphia is set in an environment inspired by the Greek mythology. The heroine of the game was a fearless maiden who tried to protect her home town from the onslaught of monsters. But even her power was no enough, and she was slain... Touched by her sacrifice, the goddess Athena revived her as a flying demi-goddess. Restored to new life, Sylphia can now unleash her wrath upon the monsters and their supporters.  Despite its theme and setting, Sylphia plays like a vertically scrolling shooter. As in most games of this kind, the gameplay consists of shooting down waves of enemies, on the ground and in the skies. Sylphia can use four types of ranged attacks, which roughly correspond to other shooters' traditional weapons: fire blasts, laser, spreading fire, homing missiles. These weapons are displayed as colored orbs and must be collected. Power-ups can be collected for each type of attack. In addition, a devastating special attack can be stored (for one charge) and executed.
