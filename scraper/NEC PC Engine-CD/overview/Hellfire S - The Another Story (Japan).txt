 Hellfire S is an updated version of the horizontal space shooter  Hellfire.****Basic gameplay, level layout, and graphics are for the most part identical to those of the earlier version.****An important gameplay-related difference is the absence of "check points". If the player's ship is destroyed, the player loses a "life", but the next ship is deployed at the same spot, without the necessity to replay large portions of a level again.****This version also features full-screen, anime-style cut scenes between levels, which advance the plot.
