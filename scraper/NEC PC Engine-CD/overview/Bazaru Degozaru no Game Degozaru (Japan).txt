 Bazaru de Gozaru no Game de Gozaru is a puzzle game starring a  monkey protagonist named Bazaru. The concept of the game is remotely similar to that of  Lemmings: the player's task is to "program" the actions of the hero in order to safely traverse a stage full of traps and hazards. Unlike Lemmings, there is only one primate to control in this game; also, the player's "programming" must be performed before letting the monkey loose, unlike the real-time player input in Lemmings.****The player basically orders the monkey what to do at specific spots (which are highlighted by exclamation marks on the level map). In the beginning the levels are short and simple, and the monkey can perform only one action. As the game advances, the puzzles become more and more complex, and so is the amount of actions the monkey must perform to reach safety.****The actions include, but are not limited to: running, jumping (in both directions), rolling, pushing, sitting, etc. New actions are learned as the player advances. The player must study the level carefully and often predict the behavior of hostile characters as well as laws of physics, since the monkey can get easily trapped, killed by enemies, fall off cliffs, etc. For example, a wild boar will immediately charge at the monkey; using the momentum, the player can use the animal as a trampoline to jump to higher ground. ****Many levels can be solved in different ways. Alternate solutions are harder to figure out, but may lead to bananas, coins, and other things of interest.
