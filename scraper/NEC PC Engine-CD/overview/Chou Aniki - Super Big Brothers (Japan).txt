 The first in the increasingly bizarre Cho Aniki side-scrolling shooters.**As in many of the best examples of the genre, Cho Aniki puts the player in control of a flying avatar that must clear out several levels of enemies while avoiding their firing patterns and attacks, as well as collecting power-ups that increase firepower, life, etc...****The unique aspect to Cho Aniki (much like Konami's Parodius games) is that the whole game is filled with bizarre stuff. Two different playable characters are available (male and female) with different firing modes and other characters can aid them as options. Said characters include flying babies and laser shooting bodybuilders. Enemies include flying heads and gigantic bodybuilders, as well as other examples of (usually very muscular) men fused with all sorts of machinery.****Single player-only gameplay with 3 difficulty levels to choose from.
