 In the year 2048, the mother computer on the moon base was destroyed, the alien invasion stopped, and peace brought back to the Earth. However, three years later a space probe launched between Saturn and Uranus confirmed humanity's worst fears: a huge alien armada was moving from the deep space towards the Earth. Pilots controlling the newest fighter spacecraft, the OF-2, are humanity's last hope.  Operation Deepstriker is a vertically scrolling sci-fi shoot-em-up, and a sequel to Image Fight. Gameplay mechanics are similar to those of the previous game: green containers must be shot at to reveal power-ups of various colors and shapes; some of these enhance the ship's primary weapon, change the direction of the shot, or attach a head weapon with different properties (lasers, missiles, etc.) to the ship. Some of the stages take place in closed environments, where careful manipulation of the ship is required. Stages typically end in boss battles. Anime-style cutscenes with voice-overs advance the story between the stages and reveal information about the protagonist's past and personal life.
