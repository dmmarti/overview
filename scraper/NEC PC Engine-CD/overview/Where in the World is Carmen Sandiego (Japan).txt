 You start out as a rookie detective whose job is to track down a crop of thieves stealing the world's most precious treasures. After each assignment briefing, you'll be given a deadline to capture the thief that stole the artifact using clues dealing with your knowledge of geography. The game is an updated version of the original Where in the World is Carmen Sandiego?, featuring enhanced graphics, sound effects, and additional control schemes, such as joystick support for computer platforms.
