 Dekoboko Densetsu is a humorous game that combines elements of arcade action and racing. Up to five players can compete in the races. All the stages are vertically-scrolling (top-down), with the cars represented as small sprites of different colors. The player's goal is not only to beat the other cars, but also reach the finish line safely: each car has limited hit points, and continuously receives damage during the race.****Damage can be sustained by driving over environmental hazards (pits, traps, bombs, etc.), failing to move the car forward in time (if the screen scrolls while the player-controlled car is at the bottom, it takes damage), being hit by the many enemies encountered in the game (which include a wide variety of wild animals, humans, fantasy creatures, monsters, etc.), or being hit by a competing car. Cars have the ability to jump over obstacles or enemy fire, avoiding damage.****Over the course of the races, cars accumulate points depending on their results. These points can be invested in purchasing a limited amount of destructive weaponry (missiles, bombs, "boxing glove" that hits enemies from the side, oil to drop behind the car, etc.) or protective measures.
