 Dragon's Eye is an installment in the tile-matching game series initiated by Activision. Players try to remove mahjong tiles in pairs from a set pattern. Different versions of the game have up to eight different tile sets, twelve patterns based on the animals of the Chinese zodiac, and a layout editor for creating patterns.  In addition to the standard mode, the game also features "Dragon's Eye", a two-player Shanghai variant. Players take turns adding and removing tiles from a small field with one player attempting to remove all the tiles and the other trying to position tiles to make this impossible.
