 The game is based on the comedy TV show Yoshimoto no Shinkigeki, which in its turn is based on a theatrical comedy show popular in Osaka and its surroundings. The game stars characters that either look like the actors from the TV show and/or resemble characters played by them. ****The show consists of short episodes which are depictions of comical situations, and are not related to each other story-wise. Same can be applied to the game: there is no real story, just a stretch of hilarious and intentionally impossible situation the protagonists find themselves in.****The setting is deliberately nonsensical, with the locations ranging from typical Japanese suburbs to ancient Japan, town in the American Old West, North Pole, etc. Scenarios are full of anachronisms: for example, one of the protagonists is sent in a space rocket to outer space from a desert near an Old West town, bumps into a planet, and falls back without taking any damage.****Core gameplay is that of a platformer, more precisely an old-fashioned,  Mario-type "jump-and-run". Under normal circumstances, the protagonists have no weapons; the enemies are temporarily paralyzed (not killed) by jumping over their heads.****The game contains a wealth of mini-games, most of which must be completed in order to proceed. The mini-games include: synchronized dancing (through  QTEs), rock-paper-scissors variant with pizza throwing, cowboy-like shoot-outs, and many others.
