 Shin Nihon Pro Wrestling 94: Battlefield in Tokyo Dome allows the players to experience Japan's most popular professional wrestling promotion, New Japan Pro Wrestling. The game features real wrestlers from the time period it was released in. The wrestlers appear as digitized photos in the intro sequence and on the character selection screens; during gameplay, they are rendered as 2D graphical images.  The game has four gameplay modes; the "battle mode" allows the player to choose one wrestler and compete against opponents chosen and controlled by the computer AI. The other modes correspond to a league, a cup (knock-out stages only), and a "versus" mode, in which the player can also choose any opponent to compete against. In every mode, the player is able to choose between single match (one-on-one) and tag team, with an additional wrestler on each side. The league mode allows competition between up to four players.  The combat system is similar to that of fighting games, with a side view and health bars for the wrestlers.
