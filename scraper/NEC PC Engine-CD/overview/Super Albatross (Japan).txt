 Super Albatross is a golf game. There are three modes available: training, match play, and tournament. Match play is essentially a story mode that casts the player in the role of a young man whose mother has passed away and who tries to find solace in golf. In this mode, opponents must be defeated in a linear fashion and courses are dictated by the story. In training and tournament modes the player can choose between six different courses. The tournament mode is a competition between various characters who appeared as opponents in the match play mode. The golf game itself is viewed from a top-down perspective at all times, and allows the player to choose the type of club as well as adjust the angle and the strength of the shot.
