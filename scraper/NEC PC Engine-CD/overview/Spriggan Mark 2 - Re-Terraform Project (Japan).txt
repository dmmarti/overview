 Sequel to Spriggan, Spriggan Mark 2 is one of the few side-scrolling shooters developed by Compile (as opposed to the top-down shooters they are better known for).  Once again the player gets to pilot a mecha in a war between two opposing armies, this time to decide the fate of a distant colony in outer space. As in the first game, other AI-controlled mechas join in the fight and even talk to the protagonist with full voice-overs to advance the plot. The color-coding weapon system of the original is gone, replaced with a standard collectible power-up system. No options are available to watch the player character's back, but it is possible to change the direction the player-controlled mecha faces, allowing the player to deal with threats from behind.
