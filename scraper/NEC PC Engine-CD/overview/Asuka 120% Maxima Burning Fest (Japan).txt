Ryoran Girls' Private Academy is a high-quality school, which specializes in arts and sciences, but also in martial arts. Each year the most successful students hold a fighting tournament. Each girl represents her specific area of interest (science, sports, music, etc.), and each wants to be the great winner, for her club's and her own glory.****Asuka 120% Maxima is not particularly story-driven; the story mode allows the player to choose any of the ten available girls, each featuring a short introduction, followed by a linear progression of battles against computer-controlled rivals, with a few bits of dialogue before each battle. The versus mode allows the player to compete against any opponent controlled by computer, as well as two-player battles and a andquot;watch modeandquot;, in which the player assigns fighters to computer AI and watches how they unfold.****The combat system follows a rather standard fighting game scheme; the girls execute a variety of kicks, punches, and attacks with special weapons, by pressing combinations of buttons. Girls might have unique weapons and techniques which are associated with the club/subject they represent; for example, a andquot;tomboyandquot; athletic girl will attack with baseballs and other sports accessories, etc.
