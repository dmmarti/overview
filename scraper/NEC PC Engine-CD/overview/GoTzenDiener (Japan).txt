 The Demon God has abducted the princess Misa, intending to sacrifice her in order to restore his power. The king has sent an army to rescue his daughter, led by a knight who was carrying the legendary Sword of the Valiant. All the soldiers were killed by the minions of the Demon God, and only the brave knight survived. But as he delivered the fatal blow to the Demon God, he was himself mortally wounded by him. The princess Misa has no other choice but to take the Sword of the Valiant and to find a way to escape from the Demon God's dungeon, full of deadly traps and enemies...****GÃ¶tzendiener (for some reason the title is German, meaning "idolator"), made by the creators of  Princess Maker, presents its own take on "rescue the princess" story: here, there is nobody who can rescue the princess but herself. Armed with the sword, the princess must explore the isometric dungeon, fighting enemies in real-time combat and solving environmental puzzles on the way. The princess jumps automatically, and the actions in the game are limited to attacking enemies with a sword and pushing and pulling objects.
