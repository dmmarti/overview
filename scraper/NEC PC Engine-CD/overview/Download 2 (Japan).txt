 In this sequel to  Down Load, the player once again takes control of Syd, a young "cyber diver" - a highly trained agent who is able to infiltrate the "cyber world", a virtual reality network that has replaced real life for so many humans in this grim futuristic scenario of the end of the  21st century. This time, Syd is up against an even bigger menace: a terrorist organization that has taken possession of Adolf Hitler's brain, in order to re-create it in a digital for, thus effectively reviving one of the most vile and insane dictators in human history! ****Like its predecessor, Down Load 2 is a side-scrolling shooter; it shares many elements with the original game, such as the overall setting, "virtual reality" levels with abstract design (along with real-world locations), etc. However, the control scheme is a bit different. Instead of choosing a main weapon and a sub-weapon in the beginning of a mission, the player has four types of weapons and is able to switch between them at any time. In addition to the vulcan cannon and the laser beam, which were present in the first game, the player can also use homing missiles and a short-range, yet powerful lightning gun as main weapons here.****All the weapons can be upgraded with power ups, up to three times each. Another type of a power up increases the speed of the ship (yes, Syd pilots a spaceship-like aircraft this time, not his trademark flying bike). Secondary weapons must be picked up, and include additional missiles, bombs, and protective shields. As before, powerful boss enemies must be defeated before proceeding to the next stage. Anime-style cut scenes with voice-overs advance the story.
