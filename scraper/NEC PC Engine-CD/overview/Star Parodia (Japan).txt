 Star Parodier is a "cute-'em-up" top-down shooter that lampoons the Star Soldier games by replacing most sci-fi elements with humorous graphics and sounds.  The player can choose to play the game as the starfighter from the Star Soldier games, a flying Bomberman and a giant, laser-toting PC-Engine, each featuring their own weapon combinations which can be swapped at will in-game by collecting the right power-ups. The game features fully-animated cutscenes and CD music.
