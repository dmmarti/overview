 Third game in the Shubibinman  series of action platformers. Cyborgs Tasuke and Kyapiko have taken a vacation from all their robot-bashing when they receive a plea for help from the princess of an alien world, naturally our heroes accept and make the journey to outer space, where more robot-bashing adventures await.  The game plays like a standard action side-scroller in which you must clear each stage of all enemies using your attacks and make your way to the end-level boss, kick his metallic behind and advance to the next stage. You have at your disposal an energy blade and a small collection of ranged attacks to deal with your enemies, and between certain stages you get to play shooter sequences to spice things up.  As usual for SuperCD games, the title also features fully animated cutscenes with voice acting.
