 After humans ventured into outer space, they began building colonies there. It became increasingly hard to maintain them, and special robots known as "Bidroids" were invented to do the hard work. However, the colonies began waging war on each other, and Bidroids were used for military purposes. When peace was finally achieved, the leaders decided that Bidroids could continue functioning as combat machines, but in friendly championships rather than in deadly wars. Hyper Wars is primarily a managerial simulation; robot combat itself is calculated depending on how the player created and maintained his or her robots. The player controls a manager of a team which competes in a league, complete with schedules, stadiums, etc. The player is given an initial budget with which he or she is able to create the first robot models and train them. Each robot can be created by merging together various parts ("human", "beast", "bird", and so on). After creation, it is necessary to outfit the robot with weapons and upgrade its parameters by paying for training. When the player feels ready, the robots can be taken to combat arenas and participate in the tournament.
