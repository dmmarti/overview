A mouse-driven shoot-em-up which was only ever released for the Apple IIgs. The player controls a red helicopter which must defend an escaping convoy of ships at the bottom of the screen. This convoy is under constant attack from incoming gunboats, torpedoes, and the like. Gameplay consists primarily of destroying incoming hazards by shooting them down; a limited number of immolation charges are also available, which set the player's helicopter on fire for a short period of time, which causes it to destroy anything it touches. The game ends when either all the player's ships or helicopters are destroyed.
