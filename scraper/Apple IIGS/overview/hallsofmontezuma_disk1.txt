Blindness is a fact of life for commanders, who have to wait for their men to call in with information. This game puts the player in the shoes of a Corps commander—a man responsible for several divisions—for the lives of thousands of men. The player will command some of the most famous battles in U.S. history, and will have to deal with the same lack of face-to-face contact that plagues every higher-level military leader. In this game the player replays historical battles in the wars with Mexico, World War I, World War II and the Korean War.
