Mickey Mouse performs baton acrobatics while balancing on a ball in a circus. Donald Duck watches his acrobatic feats. Move Mickey Mouse left and right to catch the batons, but beware of the flaming torches. One miss is scored when Mickey Mouse fails to catch a baton, or when he catches a flaming torch. Three misses and game ends. 1 point for each baton Mickey Mouse catches and tosses. Maximum displayed score is 999. At 300 points fanfare sounds and all misses are canceled. If there are no misses when 300 points are reached, game goes into "Chance-Time": all points are awarded at double value (2 points per baton caught) until a miss is made.
