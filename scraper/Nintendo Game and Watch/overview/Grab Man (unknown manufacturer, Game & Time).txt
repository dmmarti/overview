Same as Pac Man - do you really need instructions? Notice: Grab Man can eat pills when walking from right to left only! Pill: 5 points. Power pill: 100 points. Ghosts: 200 to 800 points. Apple: 200 to 2000 points (depending on game stage). Apples appear whenever Grab Man eats 8 pills (maximum 2 cherries per stage). Bonus points (1000) are given at level 6 and at every 5 levels. A bonus life is awarded at 5000 and at every 20000 points (just in case you have less than 3 lives left).
