Donkey Kong has been captured and chained by Mario. Donkey Kong Jr. goes to papa's rescue with key he needs to open the locks on the chains. Junior is attacked by fierce birds. He uses umbrellas to leap from heights, and balloons to get up there, opening the locks on the way. When he opens all 4 locks, papa is free. Each time he opens one lock, he must go back to START to retrieve the key, then sets out again is lost. With three misses game ends. 1 point when Junior jumps to umbrella or balloon. 2 to 10 points when Junior hits fierce bird with coconut. 10 points when Junior opens one lock. 10 points (extra bonus) when Junior opens all four locks. When score reaches 300 points and there are one or two misses, all the misses are cleared with fanfare. If there are no misses when a 300 score is reached, game goes into "CHANCE TIME". Score flashes and all the points are awarded at double value until a miss is scored. Maximum displayed score is 999 points. At 999 points score resets and game starts again (at higher speed).
