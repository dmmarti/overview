Shroeder is playing his piano. The notes fly through the air to where Woodstock is sleeping. Operate Snoopy left and right to strike down the notes with his hammer so that Woodstock may sleep in peace. If a note gets to any nest, a miss occurs; three misses and game ends. Game A: 3 lines of notes. Game B: 4 lines of notes. 1 point for each note knocked down. At 300 points a music is played and all misses are canceled; if there are no misses when 300 points are reached game goes into "Chance-Time": score flashes and all points are awarded at double value until miss is made. Maximum display score is 999 points. At 999 points score resets and game starts again (at higher speed).
