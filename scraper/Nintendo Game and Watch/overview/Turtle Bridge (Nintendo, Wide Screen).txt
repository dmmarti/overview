Tourists attempt to cross a lake from left bank to right bank with their luggage by stepping on the backs of turtles. When tourist reaches other side he hands his baggage to other tourist then crosses back again. When turtle sees a fish rising to the surface, it dives down into the water. When the tourist is on a turtle that dives, score one miss; miss mark appears on screen; three misses and game ends. Once tourist leaves the left bank, he can not climb back without his baggage to other tourist. Fishes do not rise from the center of screen in Game A. If tourist remains in center area for more than 2 minutes, fish begins rising from center also. 3 points each time tourist hand over a piece of baggage. Extra points are scored each time tourist returns to left bank. The faster the tourist makes the round trip, the higher the score (Max. points: 12. Min. points: 2). When player reaches a bonus score (successive units of 200 or 500), any miss marks indicated at the time are erased with a fanfare and game continues. If a bonus score is reached with no misses, game goes into Chance time for 20 to 40 seconds. Turtles do not move and fishes do not appear. Maximum display score is 9999 points.
