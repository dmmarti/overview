You are in a deep-sea maze. Your task is to outwit the deadly sea monsters. Every step you take you absorb a power atom giving you the energy to continue and score points. Your aim is to clear the maze completely. The monsters will try to protect the territory and chase you. If you are captured you loose a life. You have three lives. If you manage to absorb a "marine energizer" you can chase and destroy the monsters scoring bonus points. There are many power atoms, marine energizers and two bonus stars - which flash on and off. If you manage to clear the maze, a new full maze will appear, allowing you to continue your greedy rampage. There are two secret tunnels in the maze. Both Chewy and the monsters can enter them. The tunnels are indicated by arrows on the screen. 10 points are scored each time a power atom is absorbed. 200 points are scored each time a sea monster is defeated. 2000 points are scored each time a bonus star is absorbed. Bonus life is awarded at 20000 points. Maximum displayed score is 99990.
