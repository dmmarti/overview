A fire breaks out on a luxury liner; passengers jump from the ship. Put lifeboat in position for catching passengers. Each lifeboat holds up to four passengers. There is a shore on the left and right of the screen. When a lifeboat reaches shore, passengers will unload automatically. 1 point per person caught. 1 point per person unloaded to shore. Maximum displayed score is 999. At 300 points fanfare sounds and all misses are canceled; if there are no misses when 300 points are reached game goes into "Chance-Time": score flashes and all points are awarded at double value (2 points per passenger caught or unloaded to shore) until a miss is made.
