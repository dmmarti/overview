The love boat engine needs coal, or it'll stop cruising across the ocean. Move a busy worker in order to throw coal continuously into the furnace. When a lot of coal is not supplied, a chance is missed. A mate appears occasionally, bringing some tea to our character (game B only). Three misses and game ends. 10 points are scored each time a lot of coal is thrown into the furnace. 50 points are scored each time the worker drinks some tea. A quick rest is awarded at every 1000 points. Maximum displayed score is 9990.
