Game is divided into four phases. In Phase 1, you must destroy a squadron of fighters that attack in two different patterns: a zigzag and a backward-forward motion. In Phase 2, another squadron attacks, this time in a circular formation. In Phase 3, the enemy command ships are vulnerable but watch out for their barrage of missiles! In Phase 4, you are challenged to complete a difficult docking maneuver. Your earth ship launches a space shuttle and the countdown begins. Five misses and game ends (in phases 1 to 3). In Phase 1, enemy warships on top rows are worth 10 or 20 points each. In Phase 1, enemy warships moving down are worth 40 or 50 points each. In Phase 2, enemy warships are worth 70 points each. In Phase 3, enemy command ships are worth 100 points each. In Phase 4, you score bonus points. The amount of points depend on how much time you spend to complete the docking maneuver. Maximum displayed score is 10000.
