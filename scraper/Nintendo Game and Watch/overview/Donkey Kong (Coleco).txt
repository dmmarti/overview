Move Mario to make him rescue his girlfriend, kidnapped by Donkey Kong. In odd levels, Donkey Kong throws barrels at Mario. Operate Mario and take him to the top of the building, making him avoid barrels. In even levels, operate Mario in order to remove all rivets from the girders by walking above them. Fireballs hang around: be sure Mario won't touch them! Additional info: don't let Mario move too left or right of the girders or he'll fall down; the left ladder on the second girder is a "safe position" from barrels; Mario can walk, not jump through the electric fence below Donkey Kong.
