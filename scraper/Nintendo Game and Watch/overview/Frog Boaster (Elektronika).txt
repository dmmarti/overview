Move a frog to catch butterflies. When a butterfly escapes, a miss is scored. The chicken appears/disappears at every five seconds. When the cock appears while butterfly escapes, half miss is scored (miss mark blinks). Three full misses and game is over. 1 point is scored for each butterfly caught by frog. At 200 and 500 points, if there are one or more misses, fanfare sounds play and all misses are canceled. Maximum displayed score is 999 points.
