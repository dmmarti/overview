A Kong kidnapped a very nice girl and took her to the mysterious jungle. She's waiting for you to save her. Now it's up to you to make your way to her. You can escape the Kong by jumping the tires he's throwing at you. You may want to rest for a while on short benches placed here and there. There's four items on the left side of the tree. The purse and the shoe on floors 1 and 3 award you with bonus points. The magic cakes on floors 2 and 4 make you invincible for a short time. You can smash tires by simply hitting them, and they're worth bonus points. When you save the girl, she awards you with a kiss. But beware of the Kong, he will kidnap her again! At every 4 completed stages, Kong falls down from tree tree, then game starts again at increased difficulty. If time runs out, or you get hurt by a tire, a life is lost. When all lives are lost, game ends. 10 points are scored when jumping a tire 100 points are scored when getting a bonus item 100 points are scored when smashing a tire 300 to 500 points awarded when completing level (depending on remaining time).
