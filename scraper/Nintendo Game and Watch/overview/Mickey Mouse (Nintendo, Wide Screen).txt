Chickens lay eggs. Control Mickey Mouse so that he catches them in his basket. When Mickey Mouse drops an egg, one miss is scored. Minnie Mouse appears/disappears at every five seconds. When Minnie Mouse appears while egg falls, half miss is scored (miss mark blinks). Three full misses and game is over. 1 point per caught egg. At 200 and 500 points, if there are one or more misses, fanfare sounds and all misses are canceled. Maximum displayed score is 999 points.
