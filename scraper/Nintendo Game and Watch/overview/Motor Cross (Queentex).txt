Your aim is to overtake as many bikers as possible before running out of fuel and crashing your bike. As soon as you score a fixed amount of points on the current track, a new track will be made available for you to race. At the beginning of the track, you'll have a new bike with full fuel tank. Sometimes a fuel pump or a spanner will appear on the left or right sides of the road. You can fill your fuel tank or restore your bike by moving close to them and then pressing Start to collect them. When game is over you can continue the game by pressing Start before the "CON" writing fades (10 seconds). You'll run the same track and your score will be reset zero. 100 points per every overtaken bike, (slow speed). 200 points per every overtaken bike, (medium speed). 300 points per every overtaken bike, (fast speed). Maximum displayed score is 199900 points, then score resets to 0.
