Chickens lay eggs. Control the wolf so that he catches them in his cap. When the wolf drops an egg, one miss is scored. The cock appears/disappears at every five seconds. When the cock appears while egg falls, half miss is scored (miss mark blinks). Three full misses and game is over. 1 point per caught egg. At 200 and 500 points, if there are one or more misses, fanfare sounds and all misses are canceled.
