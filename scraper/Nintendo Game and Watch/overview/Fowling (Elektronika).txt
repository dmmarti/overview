Hunt as many birds as possible by placing the gun in the correct direction as birds fly away. Misses: one miss is scored per each missed bird. If dragon is on screen while bird flies away, half a miss is scored; miss mark blinks. If dragon is not on screen bird flies away, a full miss is scored; miss mark appears. 1 point per killed bird. At 200 and 500 points, if there are one or more misses, fanfare sounds play and all misses are canceled. Maximum displayed score is 999 points.
