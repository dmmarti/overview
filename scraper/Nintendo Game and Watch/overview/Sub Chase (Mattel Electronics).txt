Computer controls submarine attack. Turn power on: single (bright red) dot appears: that's your ship. Use cursor keys to steer ship within range of invisible submarine. "Sonar" single beep means submarine is nearby. "Sonar" frequent beeps mean submarine is very near or under your ship. Fire depth charge by using control key. You have 30 on board to sink as many submarines as you can. Sink one and computer programs another submarine. Watch out for torpedoes (moving line of dots). If submarine sinks your ship, game is over. Game is also over when you have no more depth charges on board. 1 to 5 points per submarine sunk (score depends on how many charges you shot). Scores over 100 will be displayed by code, I.E.: 100-109 hits by "A0-A9", 110-119 by "B0-B9", 120-129 by "C0-C9", 130-139 by "D0-D9", 140-149 by "E0-E9".
