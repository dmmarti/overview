Charlie Brown and Snoopy are playing tennis. Snoopy has to climb the tree to receive Charlie Brown's serve. Lucy keeps butting in, intercepts the ball from snoopy and returns it. Pressing when ball is just in front of Snoopy's face is good timing.  When Snoopy swings and misses, he can not move until his racket returns to original position. When Snoopy misses, ball continues on, followed by sound of broken bottles. CRASH mark appears. Snoopy pretends innocence, fakes sleep. Charlie Brown throws racket down in despair. 2 points when returning Charlie Brown's ball. 3 points when returning Lucy's ball. Bonus scores are those with 200 or 500 points (200, 500, 1200, 1500, ... to 9500). When each bonus score is reached, fanfare sounds and all misses are canceled. When a bonus score is reached and there are no misses registered, game goes into "Chance time" for 50 to 70 seconds. Score flashes on and off, returning Charlie Brown's ball score 5 points, Lucy's ball score 6 points. Maximum display score is 9999 points.
