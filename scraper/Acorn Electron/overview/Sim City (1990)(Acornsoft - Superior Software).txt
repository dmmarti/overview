With SIM CITY, take the destiny of the world's greatest cities in hand. Build houses, streets, factories, airports and power stations. You will have to fight crime and pollution, collect taxes and balance your budget.    Everything is managed and animated in real time. Every decision influences instantly the life of your town. You will face crises, natural disasters (tornadoes, earthquakes, etc.), but - who knows - maybe one day you will construct the perfect city.    SIM CITY is an all-absorbing and unique game. Other computer versions were voted the TOP GAME and TOP SIMULATION of the year in America (1989) and received a TILT D'OR award in France (1990).
