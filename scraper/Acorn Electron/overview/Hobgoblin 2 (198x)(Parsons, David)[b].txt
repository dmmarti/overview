Fifty years have passed since Zanok, the only son of King Garath, recovered the Golden Orb and put to flight the Ghosts and Hobgoblins that were terrorising the people of Altoris. Now, once again, Altoris is under attack but this time you have been chosen to go forth into battle against the evil Lord of the Hobgoblins and his vicious creations. If you enjoyed Hobgoblin, this game is a must!
