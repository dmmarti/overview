Test your skill and reflexes to breaking point in an endless battle to halt the progress of the landers in their mission to capture humanoids from your planet surface. Stop them returning to outer space where they will eventually mutate and take up a deadly pursuit of your space fighter. And in between, look out for the flying pods, swarmers, alien bombers and deadly baiters; they're just as dangerous. It's embarrasing to be beaten by an overblown jellyfish, but we're sure you'll eventually go under.
