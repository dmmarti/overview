Trapped - in a 1970s arcade game! Every escape route is blocked by a wall of brightly coloured bricks. Powerfully addictive, Impact has 80 built in screens, but if you prefer you can design your own - as hard, as simple, as much fun as you like. Hidden on each screen are special tokens - catch them if you can. Use them to buy one of nine powerful weapons, or keep them until the end of the screen to score a bonus. If you thought the fun had gone out of computer games, then Impact is the game that'll change your mind!"
