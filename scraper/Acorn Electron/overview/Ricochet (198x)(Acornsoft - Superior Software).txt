Ricochet is an arcade adventure game originally developed for the BBC Micro and Acorn Electron home computers, and published by Superior Software in 1989. It was written by Neil Davidson and David Williams, with some graphics work and level design by Nik Weston and Guy Burt. It was released in an updated form for Microsoft Windows in 2005 by Superior Interactive. The object of the game is to retrieve five hourglasses from diverse scenarios to restore the flow of time. It features elements of both platform and puzzle games. The player controls a red sphere wearing sunglasses. Being a ball, the traditional run and jump actions are replaced with roll and bounce.
