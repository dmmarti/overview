Robotron: 2084 is a 1982 video Arcade game by Williams Electronics which was ported to a range of home computers and consoles. The BBC Microcomputer/Electron version was released by Atarisoft in 1984. Gameplay is pretty unique for the time. You can move and fire in any of eight directions. You get thrown in a room with various evil baddies strewn about, you've got to kill all the robots while at the same time finding some way to grab humans and avoid death.
