A single-screen arcade platformer where you play a sneaky chameleon that wants to eat all hen's eggs, placed in nests on platforms and girders. As a chameleon, you can use your tongue both to pull yourself up to the next platform, to eat eggs and to attack enemies. All the while, the hens attack you by swooping at you and sometimes rolling flashing hard eggs at you, while a big vulture at the top of the screen throws baseballs at you. Once all eggs are eaten and all birds at killed, it's on the to the next screen, but if you leave an egg for too long, it will hatch and a new hen is born.
