Naughty Boy is a Shoot 'Em Up game from Jaleco based on the arcade game of the same name. You stand in the forest but it is not Idyllic, there are several monsters around you and a safety zone behind the red door, which the monsters cannot enter. The same type of doors appear on fences along the side of the screen. Naughty Boy can appear on the other side of the screen by passing through these doors. Naughty Boy must maneuver his way safely through the forest, past the fences and ponds and destroy the flags that are flying on the goblin-guarded fortress with thrown rocks.
