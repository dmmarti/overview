Universal Soldier is the licensed video game based on the 1992 movie starring Jean-Claude Van Damme.  You control Van Damme's character as he turns against his platoon and attempts to bring down the corrupt government organization that created him.

This game uses the Turrican engine. It's basically the same as Turrican, but with different graphics and levels.
