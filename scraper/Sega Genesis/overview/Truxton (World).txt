Truxton is one of the earlier 2D scrolling shoot-em-ups. Originally an arcade game, the Genesis/Megadrive version was the only home port of the game released in the United States of America and Europe (and is fairly rare to find). The game was released as "Tatsujin" on the PC Engine in Japan as well.

The game features the usual vertical scrolling backdrops, multiple rounds/stages, myriads of enemy fighters, BIG guns and power-ups.
