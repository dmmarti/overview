Hola! Sylvester's alter-ego, Dr Cheesefinger, has captured Speedy's girlfriend Carmel and took the whole cheese supply with him. With the help of some other Looney Tunes characters, you can fight back through a large number of platform levels.

Speedy can throw his hat or jump enemies to defeat them. To get an ally, you need to collect certain objects (e.g. carrots for Bugs Bunny) and in the meantime, you also have to free your captured friends. Ay, carumba!
