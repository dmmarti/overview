Prime Time NFL Football is one of the many football titles released back in the day. It features all 30 NFL teams at the time and the updated 1994 roster along with the standard modes such as Exhibition, Season and Playoffs.

Along with signing free agents and trading players, players could also customize their playbook, change weather conditions, relocate their team, play multiple schedules as well as save 15 different user records. The main draw of the game was the personal endorsement by Deion Sanders.
