Most everyone familiar with electronic games has heard of Street Fighter II - the most famous beat-em-up series ever. Basically you get a bunch of fighters together (12 in this case) and get them to punch, kick, bite and thump the bejesus out of each other then you're close.

Here yet another slightly different version of the game turns up - this time on the Genesis. Special Champion Edition is similar in most respects to the original Street Fighter II (which never turned up on the Genesis anyway) except that all 12 characters are selectable from the get-go (the boss characters were originally locked) and the game engine has been revamped.
