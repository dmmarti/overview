Elemental Master's gameplay is similar to a top-down space shooter (i.e Raptor & Raiden), but what makes it unique is the fact you play as a human instead of space-ship.

There are different kinds of weapons which you can use. Like other games in the genre you also have tons of strange enemies to destroy.
