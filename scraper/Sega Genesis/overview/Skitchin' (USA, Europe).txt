You rollerblade (inline skate) down the road, grabbing tows from passing cars.  Grab weapons to beat back your opponents.  Race from city to city to earn money. Buy better skates, weapons, and protection with your winnings.  
This game is clearly derived both in technology and in design from the hit Road Rash series, and was released during the great rollerblading boom of the early-to-mid nineties.
