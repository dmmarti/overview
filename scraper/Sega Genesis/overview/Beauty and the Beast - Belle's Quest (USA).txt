Play as Belle from Disney's "Beauty and the Beast" and (loosely) follow the animated film's story. Jump and duck to ward off hindrances, which can come in forms of birds, rats, bats, etc. 

Also have the 'beauty' interact with her supporting characters as you lead her from her start as a village girl, to the final dance with her prince in the ball room.
