Journey through as Geppetto, the carpenter's live wooden puppet, Pinocchio, as he did in his Disney animated film - which itself was based on a children's novel.

Have Pinocchio run, jump and twist-kick through all the familiar places, including the inside of a whale, and do good deeds enough to become the real human boy he's always wanted to be.

A standard Disney platformer.
