This follow-up to Thunder Blade is very similar to the original arcade game. Get into your helicopter and blast away at the numerous enemies with your cannon and missiles. The four stages all follow a similar pattern: the first part is from a perspective behind your helicopter where you not only have to dodge enemy fire but also obstacles like buildings or caves. In between, face off against one or two smaller boss enemies. When the first part of a level is finished, the view switches to an overhead perspective for the confrontation with the level end boss.
