Triple Play: Gold Edition is an update of the previous year's title. It looks and plays very much like the previous title, including the close-up batting view and extensive stat tracking. The game features an MLBPA license, with a full 1996 season roster and stats based on the 1995 season. Additionally, this update adds a new "pro" difficulty level for experienced players, and just like the previous title also allows for up to four players to play.
