As Prince Ali, you are out to stop an evil sorcerer and save the island of Oasis. To do so, you will need your wits, skills and the powers of the four Wild Spirits.

Beyond Oasis is a fast action RPG with special combat moves, unique weapons and spell attacks, cool animations, and lots of puzzles, hidden areas and hidden moves.

Beyond Oasis has a huge assortment of monsters, which in turn are either massive (like the Red Dragon boss) or interesting (like the zombies that split in to, and their torso continues to crawl and attack you.)

The Wild Spirits are elementals you can call to help to destroy enemies or solve puzzles. The Wild Spirits are a fire spirit, a water spirit, a plant spirit, and a shadow spirit.
