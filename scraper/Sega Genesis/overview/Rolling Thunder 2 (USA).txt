A follow up to the original rolling thunder, this game is your basic shot-the-bad-guys-and-save-the-world game.

A terrorist group has taken out the world information flow and, as either a guy named Albert Ross or a woman named Leila, you must stop them. You can also get cool weapons that pack more of a punch than your ordinary hand gun.

Also RT2 is a password supported game, so in other words you get a password at the end of each round so if you loss all your lives, you can continue from the end of that round, very handy.
