Edson Arantes do Nascimento, commonly known to us as football legend Pel�, licensed a second football game, featuring the 24 qualifiers for the 1994 World Cup, each with summaries and tactical advice from Pel�. These can play in either friendly matches or the full tournament. A five-a-side mode is included, taking place on a full-sized field.

The view is isometric, although playing bottom-right to top-left, the opposite of FIFA International Soccer. Weather effects are optional, matches can be between 5 and 45 minutes (in 5-minute increments), and penalty shoot-outs are optional. A full range of formations are available, as well as squads of 22 fictitious players.
