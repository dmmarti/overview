Essentially a side-on scrolling beat 'em up in the vain of Way of the Exploding Fist, but with an epic storyline and puzzles a-plenty.

The introduction, now an Amiga classic, shows the Beast-mage stealing your infant sister and the purpose of the game is to rescue her back. On the way a variety of puzzles, sub-quests and really nasty monsters dog your every step.
