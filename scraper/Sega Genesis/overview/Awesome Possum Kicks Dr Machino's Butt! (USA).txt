In just a few years, mankind has succeeded in destroying the environment and endangering all living species. Under the guidance of the evil Dr. Machino, robotic machines were built to turn the Earth into a soulless place without live nature. There is only one hero who can save the living beings of the planet - you, a little possum. Fight Dr. Machino's robots and liberate the Earth!

Various robotic creatures will will try to kill you during your journey to Dr. Machino's lair. You can either avoid or try to defeat them on your way.
