Trouble is in the kingdom of Dilsarl: the young, beautiful princess Salasa was abducted by the evil arch-mage Balrog! The king seeks help by the four best warriors of the country. Your task is clear, but not so simple: find Balrog, destroy his evil minions and other monsters who try to stop you, and rescue the princess!

This is a platform action RPG. You choose one of the four character classes in the beginning of the game: fighter, priestess, mage, or ninja. You fight your way through dungeons, attacking physically or casting spells (as priestess or mage). Like in regular platform games, there are places where you should jump, duck, or climb. You gain experience for defeating monsters, and your level rises in a true RPG fashion.
