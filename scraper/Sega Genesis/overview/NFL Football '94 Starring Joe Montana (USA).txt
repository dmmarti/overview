After SEGA picked up the license and changed names with last year's edition, they ultimately decided to drop 'Sports Talk' for the simpler title "NFL Football". With over 800 players based on the 1992 season, all of the series trademarks including play-by-play commentary, authentic playbooks and instant replays are intact. Battery backup support is available for season play. This release features significant camera adjustments including a lower perspective and some enhanced zooming features which bring mixed reactions.
