In this quasi-sequel of Wimbledon, Sega secured the ATP license, bringing 32 players (including Pete Sampras, John McEnroe and Stefan Edberg) plus a few others from the Senior Tour (among six others, legends such as Ilie Nastase and Stan Smith), as well as the option to create four players that can be developed in the ATP Tour mode. Each player has seven attributes that define their  control and power in both serve, forehand and backhand, as well as their footwork. Four court types are available which affect the speed and bounce of the ball in different ways, and 11 real ATP tournaments are available to play.

There are three game modes: Exhibition match, Exhibition Tournament (where the player competes in a 32-player tournament), ATP Senior Tour Event (where the player chooses one of the retired players and competes in a 8-player tournament) and the ATP Tour, where it's possible to create a player and develop his skills by winning (or simply doing well) on tournaments, with one extra point on each round won.

Gameplay uses a simple 3-button layout, where the A button lobs the ball, B performs a controlled passing shot and C allows the fastest top spin shots, with the directional pad affecting the direction and depth of the shot.
