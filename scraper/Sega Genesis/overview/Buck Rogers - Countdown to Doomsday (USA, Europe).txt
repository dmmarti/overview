It is the year 2456.

Humanity has spread across the terraformed planets and satellites of the solar system. Colonies drift though the upper regions of the Jupiter gas clouds and cities have been carved out of asteroids. Mars, the seat of power among the inner worlds, is home to a powerful, despotic Russo-American Mercantile (RAM). Its goal: The enslavement of the solar system.

But what of Earth?

The ancesteral home of mankind now struggles to overcome the devistation of war and pollution. All hope for a return to its former glory lies in a daring band of rebels, the New Earth Organization (NEO) led by Buck Rogers.

Now you and the members of your team can join Buck and his allies to rid the solar system of RAM tyranny!
