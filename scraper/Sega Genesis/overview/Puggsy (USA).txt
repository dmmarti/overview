Your goal is find the spaceship so you can get off the planet and return home.  To do this, you will need to make your way from the start to the exit of numerous levels which take place in a variety of environments.

Some objects can used (like a gun or keys), and objects may be thrown, moved around and stacked. Of course, each level will also have a variety of bad guys wandering about which will cost Puggsy one of his lives if he's caught. On your quest there will also be six evil guardians which will need to be defeated before you get your spaceship back!
