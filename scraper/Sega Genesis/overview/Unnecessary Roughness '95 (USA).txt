UR95 is your average football game featuring both single plays against the computer or a friend, and full-fledged seasons, including playoffs and Super Bowls.

The main attraction to the game however is a "Construction Set" option which allows you to create everything for your own team, to your playbook and tournaments. You can even do your own team's logo and import/export your creations to trade with your friends.
