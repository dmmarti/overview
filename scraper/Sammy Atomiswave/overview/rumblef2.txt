he Rumble Fish 2 uses all of the elements from the first game and adds some new ones.    The Offense and Defense gauges have been divided into three sections each, allowing for more usage of Offensive and Defensive Arts, as well as techniques tied to each gauge. An addition to the system is the Boost Dive, which puts each character into a powered-up state according to their style.    Most characters have had modifications to their movelists in some way, such as new moves, new commands for old moves, and so forth.
