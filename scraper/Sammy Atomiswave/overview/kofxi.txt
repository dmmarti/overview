The 11th team of fighters continues this tradition. KOF11 is suited for one to two players, with continuous buy-in. Choose from 33 fighters, including 4 new characters. A fifth control button was added to enhance your skills by delivering a devastating blow to your opponent, if hit at the right time. A New Skill Gauge performs a variety of tag-off moves and new attacks. A player can also custom construct a Three-Fighter Tag-Team by selecting three choice combatants.'
