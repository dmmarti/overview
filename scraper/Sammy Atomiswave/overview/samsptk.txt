Among other series changes, aerial blocking was removed entirely, and the switch-around move, which enabled a player to shift quickly behind the other's back, as well as the dodge (evade, side-step), in which the move virtually brings a semi-3D environment to the defense in attempt to use each sword more effectively.    One can no longer charge one's own "pow" gauge. The off-screen delivery man was omitted entirely from the game. The "CD combo" was added, wherein a player can press the C and D buttons together, triggering a strike that can be followed up by a sequence of button taps.    SNK also added a "suicide" move, wherein one's character forfeits the round. The bonus to this is that the one committing suicide will start the next round with a full "POW" gauge. Certain finishes also enable a "fatality" move in the vein of Mortal Kombat.
