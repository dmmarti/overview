Defend your territory in Fieldrunners, a strategy game in the vein of Desktop Tower Defense.  Enemies begin to cross a field, and your goal is to prevent them from reaching the other side.  To do this, you are given cash to spend placing turrets, flamethrowers, rocket launchers and other defensive equipment across the field.  As you progress, you earn more money, which can be used to replace or upgrade existing equipment, or build more of it to increase your defensive power.
