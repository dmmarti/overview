Are your eyes keen enough to spot the difference, even if it's ever so slight, in a pair of pictures? This game gives you that classic puzzle challenge while also offering a journey through odd and picturesque scenes on various themes: travel, gastronomy, playground, sports, pets, wildlife. 
 
Three game modes are available in Spot The Differences! In Arcade Mode, images appear in a random sequence. Spot 5 differences in each picture! In Select Pictures Mode, play with pictures you choose. And in Time Attack Mode, spot one difference in each picture and then switch -- spot as many as you can while the timer runs!
