In the next chapter crusader Fortix has to save the rest of the continent from an evil curse. On his journeys Fortix will be aided by his sister Floriana. Fortix 2 will be a 'funtasy' game, where you have to conquer dozens of hostile wastelands, deserts, swamps, and convert to lush landscapes. Savage wolfs will be turned to peaceful lambs, bloodthirsty dragons to seed-picking pigeons.
