Once again, the pioneering 1982 Fighting Fantasy gamebook #1, The Warlock of Firetop Mountain, finds itself adapted for electronic play -- for the third time in three years, making for its fifth licensed adaptation! Gameplay is a very faithful adaptation of the gamebook's Choose-Your-Own-Adventure decision-making, souped up with some of Laughing Jackal's innovations (tarot-reading character generation, skill-testing minigames in place of randomized die-rolls) from their earlier adaptation of the gamebook Talisman of Death. Game text is presented as scrolling words on a page, complete with the book's original illustrations.
