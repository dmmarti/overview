Numba is a puzzle game where you must link sequences of adjacent numbers to make blocks disappear and new blocks fall from the top of the screen. However, here you can match blocks in many ways -- for example, you can match blocks with the same repeated number (4-4-4, say), or you can make sequences of numbers like 3-4-5 or 2-4-6-8. Some special blocks add variety to the mix -- blocks that blink in and out of existence, fire blocks which become solid rock if neglected for too long, ice blocks which need to be thawed before used, and so on.
