Beam'em Up is a downloadable action/puzzle game for PSP in which the player is cast in the role of a space scientist, piloting a spaceship with the goal of acquiring and collecting alien specimens from various planets and environments. Thanks to lush environments styled in 1950s sci-fi visuals, an accurate 2D physics system, addictive puzzle gameplay, and collection mechanics, Beat'em Up is homage to the classic era of videogames, revisited with contemporary look and feel.
