Money, girls, and glory everything's on the line in this brutal take to the streets. Good, old-fashioned street fighting is the name of the game in a realistic, all-inclusive brawl. Choose to fight as: Karate Man, a martial arts expert with lightning-quick moves; or Crusher, a stacked giant with a powerful punch. Try out head-bashing maneuvers, such as Crusher's Kansas Tornado Kick or Karate Man's Dragon's Tail. The one who makes it out of the tournament standing wins a load of cash and the hand of a pretty girl, so you'd better believe that the computer opponents are coming to fight. And you'd be wise to do the same, tough guy.
