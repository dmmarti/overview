Slurp up the fun in the quirky PSPÂ® soup game Ramen Heaven. Use your chopsticks to collect bubbles of oil floating on the soup, and place them in your spoon to eat up, increasing your satisfaction gauge. A bowl of ramen has never had so many obstacles in it, knock into an egg and your oil bubble will split up, braise a naruto, and it may pop altogether. Heat up the fun by grabbing a friend and competing head to head!
