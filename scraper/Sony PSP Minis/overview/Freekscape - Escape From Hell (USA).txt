Freekscape: Escape from Hell is a 2.5D puzzle platformer. The protagonist is the horned demon Freek who is left behind in hell because he does not enjoy torturing souls. That is why he is tasked with housekeeping chores instead by his master Beel. Working alone, he discovers the key to the treasure room, steals a trident and attempts to escape hell to reach heaven. To complete levels the exit needs to be reached. Levels are accessed one by one on a large world map and they branch out at a certain point with multiple paths.
