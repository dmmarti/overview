Farm Frenzy 2 is a time management game, where each action (feeding animals, producing goods, trading) needs a specific amount of time to be completed.nnnnIn the game the player has to produce a specific amount of goods within a given time. The basic action is planing grass to feed the animals. The animals will produce basic goods (e.g. hens will lay eggs) which can be sold in the city. Basic products can be processed to more valuable goods (e.g. eggs to egg powder and egg powder to cakes). Between the levels there is an upgrade shop where the player can spend stars to improve buildings and farm helpers.
