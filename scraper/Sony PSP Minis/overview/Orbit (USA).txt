Oh no! The Space Program is in peril now there's NO MONEY ANYWHERE IN THE WORLD!! That won't stop two scientists from taking on the Orbit project, a no-budget exploration of our solar system.

Dodge through asteroid fields, and avoid nasty enemies intent on stealing cash, fuel, or just throwing slime in your eyes!

The launch pad is all set. Are you ready to get into Orbit?
