Sequel to Athena, the 2D side-scroller which starred a stylized Manga version of the Greek goddess Athena as she set out to find adventure in the mortal world.nnnnThis game features Athena Asamiya, a descendant of Princess Athena, who uses her new psychic powers (hence the game's title, Psycho Soldier) to clear a post-apocalyptic world of its mutant inhabitants with the help of her friend Kensu, thus allowing simultaneous two players gameplay.
