Can you make a mountain out of sweets and candies? Drop cakes, pies, and more from your assembly line and pile them up to the sky! You are up against the clock so you need to place each sweet in just the right spot to help build your tower of treats as high as possible. Things start simple but you will soon find it's not quite as easy as taking candy from a baby.
