Who's That Flying?! is a side-scrolling shooter where the player controls a flying character, the Guardian of Earth. He is put on trial at the Galactic Council for allowing hordes of doom beasts to rampage through Earth's cities. The council consists of all the guardians of the other planets and is led by Jupiter's. To prove his innocence, he needs to recounts his version of the events, how he battled the monsters, to gather evidence. The player has to play each memory of the invasion as a series of levels to prove you, as a guardian, did sufficient effort to stop it.
