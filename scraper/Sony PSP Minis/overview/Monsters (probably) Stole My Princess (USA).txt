In this 2D platform game each level is monster encounter. The monster will try to flee up the screen and you will have to catch him using your double-jump ability. Hit the monster three times while double-jumping and it is defeated. Landing on platforms builds up your combo resulting in more advanced finishing moves when you reach the monster for the third time. Also, high combo score is crucial for progressing in the game as it will unlock trophies, scrapbook entries and a hidden level.
