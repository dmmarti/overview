Nocturnal: Boston Nightfall is a standard hidden object game with mini-games between chapters. The main objective is to find all the objects listed at the bottom of the screen, on locations cluttered with scattered and assorted paraphernalia, within a time limit. Wrong clicks take away six seconds from the clock. The timer can be turned off at the main menu.
