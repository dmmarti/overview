Wizorb is a Breakout/Arkanoid action game (bounce an orb off a magic wand to break bricks), with a sprinkle of a Japanese-style RPG. Besides breaking bricks, there are monsters to kill, spells to cast and power-ups to buy. In total, there are about 60 levels on 5 worlds, plus some extra secret levels for good measure. Next to the classic gameplay, the player has access to a magic bar with limited supply to destroy bricks with fireballs.
