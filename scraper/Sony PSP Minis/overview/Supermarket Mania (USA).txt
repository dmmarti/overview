Supermarket Mania, at its core, operates as a time management sim set in a grocery store. Or rather, five grocery stores. With a large 50-stage story mode, players take control of Nikki and must manage time and products to keep grocery stores stocked for customers. Besides just working to keep stores stocked, players have to deal with a competing grocery store. By working with speed and dedication, players earn enough cash to upgrade their grocery stores to better compete with the rival store.
