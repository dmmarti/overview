That was the state of affairs back in 1984, when it was first published as number 11 in the line of original Fighting Fantasy gamebooks; 27 years later, it makes its way to its first computerized adaptation as a PSN mini for PS3 and PSP. The gamebook's complete 400-section text has been retained with selectable hyperlinks (and lots of reading!), along with its original interior illustrations, but there is interesting new material as part of the presentation: character generation is enacted through (shades of Ultima) a tarot card reading of sorts; additionally, players can choose to resolve combat and test against their stats (the FF gold standard SKILL, STAMINA and LUCK) through the total randomness of simulated die-rolls or by participating in a more involved tile-matching memory minigame. Of course, inventory and stat adjustment are fully automated.
