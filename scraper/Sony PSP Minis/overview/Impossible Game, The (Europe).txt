The Impossible Game. With a title like that, you know it'll be a tough ride but The Impossible Game takes "difficulty" to a whole new level. It's fast-paced and brutal, but with near-instant respawning, the experience is as smooth as it is deadly.
You play a humble orange square, racing against a serene blue background. The trick is that there are plenty of obstacles on this course: triangles are like deadly spikes, and squares can be jumped on top of but will kill you if you slam into them. Likewise, you can die if you fall through a hole in the floor. Your orange square will hurtle forward regardless of the danger, and your only control is simple tap to jump. Longer taps equal longer jumps, and you?ll need meticulous precision if you want to survive. The music syncs with your music, which is a very nifty effect that adds to the surreal quality of the whole thing.
