The sequel to Vanguard, Vanguard II takes players out of the caves and into the sky above Earth. Instead of merely being able to shoot in four directions the ship now has the ability to move in eight directions as it flies over the floating alien platform. Pods on the platform must be bombed while aerial defenses must be shot down. After enough pods are destroyed the core can be bombed, destroying the platform and ending the level.
