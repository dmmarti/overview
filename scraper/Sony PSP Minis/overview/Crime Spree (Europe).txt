Yo! I got a "job" for you, if you know what I mean. The Godfather needs a favor for the Mafia. I need you to drive a getaway car, collect cash, and outrun some cops thatâ€™ll be chasing you. Race through the city as fast as you can and find some loot that some of my boys left hanging around. The cops are onto us so youâ€™re gunna have some heat on you. I mean a LOT of heat. But donâ€™t worry, my cousin Johnny left some oil cans and a few other 'tings laying around for youse to use. Just remember, your getaway car is always in motion so make sure the cops don't get you cornered! Got it! Now get 'otta here!
