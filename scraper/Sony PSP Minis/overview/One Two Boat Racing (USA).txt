Welcome to the wet wild world of One Two Boat Racing, where you need to use your reflexes and speed to stay in the lead, beat the competition, and be the first to reach the finish line. But there is more to winning than just speed. You'll need to evade pylons, blow by rocks, and make sure to avoid sludge or face wasting precious seconds and losing the race.
