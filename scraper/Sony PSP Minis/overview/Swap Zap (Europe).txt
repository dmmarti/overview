Pam can run and jump around in an increasingly hazardous space-truck, dodging falling blocks and dangers that slowly fill the cargo holds.nnEnemies pop out of the space-trucks nooks and corners to gnaw at our heroine.nnAs if that wasnÂ´t enough Pam needs to collect all power cores in each level in order to start her ship.nnThe only tool available to her is the Swap-Zapper which enables its user to change places with anything it zaps!
