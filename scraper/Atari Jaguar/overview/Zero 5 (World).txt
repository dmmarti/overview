Zero 5 was one of the last Telegames releases for the Jaguar, right before Worms. It is a wild space-shooter, placing you in control of a small and manuverable fighter craft, or a powerful warship, depending upon which level you play.

Taking on the role of a pilot, you must defend the earth from alien attack with dozens of missions needed to succeed. Your tour of duty includes travelling through deep space to meet enemy convoys head on and shooting across asteroid and planet surfaces taking out installations.

There are 3 different play modes:

1. HIT-PAK Mode - Somewhat like a variation on the Missle Command 3D VR mode. You are in a turret with four guns to blast everything in sight, including asteroids in several levels. No powerups make it more difficult.

2. BAMBAM Mode - Consists of piloting around in the fighter, shooting every object that moves, in 360 degrees. Includes power-ups for weapons, shields, and score.

3. TRENCH Mode - Star Wars style shooting in your BAMBAM fighter, you run along a trench. Also includes power-ups.
