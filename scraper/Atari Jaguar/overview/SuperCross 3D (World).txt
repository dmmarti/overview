Supercross 3D brings the excitement of arena supercross racing to the Jaguar.  Not only do you get to race ahead of your competitors, you can catch big air on the huge jumps and perform a few tricks.

There are three game modes: Practice, Single Race, and Tournament. In practice mode, you can race around any track for as long as you like.  In single race mode, you compete in one race against the computer.  Finally, in tournament mode, you compete in a series of races to accumulate points and become the Supercross champion.
