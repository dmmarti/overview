Civilization has fallen into a deep decline.  Gangs and warlords are gaining power and influence all over the world.  Then out of nowhere, a powerful being known as the Gaurdian appears with a challenge.  Unless a warrior meets his challenge, he will destroy the Earth.  So, 7 warriors from around the world fight to re-open the Ultra Vortek and restore the Earth.

Ultra Vortek is a one-on-one fighting game similar to Mortal Kombat.  Some of the fighters are digitzed actors, other are stop motion or computer animated.  You have at your control an array of punches and kicks, and a large number of special moves.  The game also features several "finishing moves" for each of the 7 warriors.
