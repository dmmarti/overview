It is the future, and the earth has been covered with wastelands and cities.  The powerful, faceless Iron First Corporation has replaced the last forms of free government.  Now, they are developing a new, 42-foot, armed robot known as the Iron Soldier.  With the Iron Soldier, no one will be able to stop the Iron First Corporation.  The only hope is the Resistance, a group that has managed to capture one of the Iron Soldier prototypes.  You are a pilot for the Resistance.  It's up to you to pilot the robot and bring down the Iron Fist.

Iron Soldier is mech sim played from an in-cockpit view.  There are 16 single player missions.  Objectives involve taking out certain targets, defending convoys, collecting items, and so on.
