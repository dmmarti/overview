On the tiny island of Kasumi, there exists a portal between this world and the Netherworld.  For many centuries, this portal has been kept closed by the balance between good and evil forces.  Now, the dark ninja lord Gyaku has defeated the forces of good, and opened the portal to the netherworld.  It is up to you, a Kasumi ninja, to stop Gyaku and restore balance to the world.

Kasumi Ninja is a one-on-one fighting game featuring digitized character graphics.  There are 8 fighters for you to choose from, each with their own fighting environments.
