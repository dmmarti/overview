Bubsy in Fractured Furry Tales is the only Bubsy game to appear on the Atari Jaguar.  It's a side scrolling platform game similar to the Genesis and SNES Bubsy series. 

Bubsy is a bobcat superhero who can defeat all enemies by jumping on top of them.  In Fractured Furry Tales, he finds himself in a series of childrens stories.  These aren't the Disney-style happy fairy tales, though.  These are the dark, disturbing Grimm-style fairy tales.  So, Bubsy has to travel through 15 levels and set things right.
