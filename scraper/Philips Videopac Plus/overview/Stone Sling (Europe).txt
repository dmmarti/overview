Stone Sling is the 20th official game released by Philips for the Videopac console. In the United States, it was sold under the title Smithereens! for the Magnavox Odyssey² console.

The game allows for two player simultaneous gameplay where both players have a fortress as well as a catapult used to fire each other. With each hit the fortress' size decreases by a bit. However, sometimes if your aim is off, the catapult will miss the fortress and instead hit one of the opposing soldiers. Like other Videopac games, Stone Sling could not compete against Atari games, though the game did do well in Europe and Brazil.
