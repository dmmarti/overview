You are a Chicky! Now, as everyone knows, the one thing a chicky does best is to lay eggs. And that's why you travel all over the Happy Daze Maze laying eggs wherever you go. Your mission is to fill the whole maze with eggs. Beware the Funky Foxes! While you travel around the Happy Daze Maze, laying your eggs and not bothering anybody, don't forget about the 4 Funky Foxes. They will sneak around and try and catch you, and if they do, they'll gobble you up for dinner. So watch out!
