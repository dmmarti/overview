Invaders from outer space are approaching your planet. Your mission (the object of the game) is to destroy as many invaders as possible and avoid being destroyed by them. If you cannot destroy all the invaders in time, they will eat up all your buildings and gradually closing in on you. The game is over when all your stations are destroyed or when the invaders successfully get to the earth level.
