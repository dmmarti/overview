You are a deep sea diver! As you explore the sea bottom, thousands of feet under water, evil sea creatures sneak up on you and attack! Creatures of the deep! The nastiest creatures of the sea are after you. The Devious Clickaw Crab, a giant armored beast. The Fanged Ray, a huge demented animal. And the Slip-Slimy Octopus, with eight giant tentacles. All of them are trying to attack you for no reason at all. Just because they are bad and mean.
