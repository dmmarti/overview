Only you can save a mouse. A poor little mouse is hungry and looking for food. He walks through pipes inside the wall, but he can't see too well. So you have to move the pipes around to help him go in the right direction. Otherwise he'll fall out the end of a pipe or maybe bonk right into a wall and that will be the end of him. Only you can help to keep him going. Watch out for City Kitty - City Kitty is a nasty, sneaky, rotten cat. In some games he will sneak into the pipes and chase your mouse. Don't let him catch up because he is hungry too. And he only eats poor little mouse.
