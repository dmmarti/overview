You're a prisoner in a train factory The only way out is to build your own train. You have to run across dangerous catwalks, high in the air and drop all the right parts onto the tracks below, in the right order, if you want to survive. Be careful, even the tools are dangerous! The hammers and wrenches and even the nails left around the factory are enchanted and will come to life and try to hammer, wrench, and nail you! All you have is an oil can to destroy them.
