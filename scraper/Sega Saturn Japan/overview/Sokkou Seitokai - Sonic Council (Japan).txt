Jinsoku Senior High School. At first glance, it`s a school that is everywhere,  with a clique of a gang of four schoolgirl student council-style fighters who  hold the "Tetsuwan" fighting ability beyond the knowledge present there. These  people are called the "Sokkou Seitokai" (Sonic Council) because they overflow  with ambition.    One day, during the "Daiuchuu Kassai" (Cosmic Life Festival), invitations for  tournament participants were received by tournament-style martial arts students that possess "Tetsuwan" throughout the whole town. They say, seemingly the power of the universe will be awarded to the winner, but perhaps because of this shady proclaimation, everyone dunked the letter into the garbage can.  However the four "Sokkou Seitokai," unanimously spoke self-centeredly: "Machi kire ne~!" ("I can`t wait!") "Tournament de wa deban ga tarinai." ("They aren`t worthy of my turn in a tournament.") "Sonohi haisha .." ("I have the dentist that day ..") "Igai-sei o motometai." ("I want the unexpected student.") Violent actions would then come to attack every last one of the students as they were all seen as participants in the end.    And even though the tournament did not begin, it left only nine people who  included the "Tetsuwan" students of "Sokkou Seitokai" and their rivals, to be  next on the chopping block.
