Original arcade by Sega's AM3 Division and even advertised in the very early Saturn promotion videos before the system's release in Japan, Funky Head Boxers finally did reach the Saturn 2 years later but not from Sega, but from Yoshimoto. The game is unique in that every character has a cubeshaped head, which is then distorted during gameplay.
