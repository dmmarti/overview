DoDonPachi is Cave's sequel to their 1995 arcade release DonPachi. Like its predecessor, DoDonPachi is a vertical-scrolling and military- and robot-themed manic shooter featuring a giant mecha bee for a final boss. The player's ship and the gameplay are virtually the same as in DonPachi, with one of three weapons selected at start then levelled-up by collecting dropped power-ups.
