The game plays in a vertically tilted orientation, very close to Silpheed. There are times when it tilts less or more, depending on the enemy youâ€™re facing.   Everything is rendered with polygons in a 3D environment, from popcorn enemies to bosses to backgrounds. Itâ€™s evident that Planet Joker carries an epic feel thatâ€™s  ultimately unmatched by the game itself, with a general design that evokes old anime series such as Gloizer X.     After choosing one out of seven huge available robots, the player must go through seven stages of rather repetitive action. The mecha characters differ in power, speed, defense and â€œchargeâ€ , which is certainly related to how fast the shield function recharges after being used. This shield makes the player invincible while active, and can only be used again after the shield bar has been fully recharged.     Another special attack is the bomb (C for a radius detonation and W for a straight wave attack), whose stock is replenished by appropriate incoming icons. The regular shot can be changed according to a power-up that comes down staggering and cycling colors (blue, green and yellow).
