Nekketsu Oyako by TechnoSoft (or alternately Tecno Soft) is a rather average Final Fight clone beat 'em up. Youâ€™ve got your three characters, the big buff slowpoke, the fast but weak girl, and the all around average guy, and they walk through a bunch of levels beating the puss out of stuff for some reason or another.
