Zero Divide: The Final Conflict is the third and final game in the 3D fighting series that originally started on Playstation. Game play wise Zero Divide is best described as a Virtua Fighter type of fighter. The game made use of the Saturn's two processors, which is why it says FEATURING “SH-2” just above the Zero Divide logo, resulting in high resolution graphic.
