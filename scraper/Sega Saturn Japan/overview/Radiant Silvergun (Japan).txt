The story of Radiant Silvergun begins with the end of the world. As the pilot of the starfighter Radiant Silvergun you are sent back in time in search of the key to save the planet. In various time periods you will battle hordes of enemies in search for an alien being knows as the Origin. Only by destroying the Origin can the dark future of the planet be altered.  Radiant Silvergun is a top-down shooter from the Japanese codeshop Treasure (Gunstar Heroes, Silhouette Mirage) released in Japan for the Sega Saturn in 1998. To tackle the swarm of enemies that fill your screen you got three different means of attack. A straight shot, a homing laser and a devastating spread shot.  In 2002 Radiant Silvergun got its spiritual successor in the Dreamcast release of Ikaruga, which would later be converted for the Nintendo Gamecube.
