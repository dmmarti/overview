One winter, the robotic blue cat from the future, Doraemon, takes Nobita and his friends on a trip into outer space. However, while they're flying across the galaxy, they wind up making an emergency landing on a strange planet after a collision... and are attacked by strange robots as soon as they land! Now, Nobita and his friends must figure out what's happened on this strange planet, and find a way to repair their ship and get home!    Doraemon: Nobita to Fukkatsu no Hoshi ("Doraemon: Nobita and the Planet of Revival") is a side-scrolling action platformer, and one of the many titles based on the long-running children's cartoon. The game is divided into short platform stages, each with a specific objective or goal that must be completed to move on. Between stages, there are voiced visual novel-style sequences which move the story forward. There are sometimes choices available in these sections, which can affect which stage the player reaches next.
