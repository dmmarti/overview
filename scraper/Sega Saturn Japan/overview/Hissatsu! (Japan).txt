Three men and a cowboy plot to assassinate tyrannical criminals in the old days of Japan. They go around at night, kill people, and sometimes have to fight something really weird like a magic monster. There are hand drawn art pieces that accompany the story between levels, but for the most part, you can ignore them. Plot really isnâ€™t that important in a game like Hissatasu. Itâ€™s more about the action than anything.    Hissatsuâ€™s sprites are all in live action, but itâ€™s background are all hand drawn sprites. The effect ends up being very surreal, like youâ€™ve got live action people walking around in a cartoon world. It doesnâ€™t help that all of the special effects use sprites, which only compounds the weirdness. The music is good, but very quiet. I guess it makes sense, as youâ€™re walking around at night and killing people, sometimes without them even knowing. Sometimes the tracks get intense, but itâ€™s usually because something really cool is about to happen, like a boss fight or some kind of supernatural enemy is appearing.
