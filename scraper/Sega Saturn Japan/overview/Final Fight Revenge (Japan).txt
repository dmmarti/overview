Final Fight Revenge was the last game released on the Saturn in Japan on the 3rd of March 2000, it is a conversion of the ST-V coin op,which to my knowledge did not receive great distribution. FFR was developed by Capcoms American staff, and is a follow up to the popular 2D side scrolling 1989 original Final Fight game, FFR however is a 1on1 3D fighter featuring 11 characters from the original. The Saturn game was released in versions, a boxed set with the 4MB RAM cart, and as the single disk, this game requires the 4MB RAM cart to play.
