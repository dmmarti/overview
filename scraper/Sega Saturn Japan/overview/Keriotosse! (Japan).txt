Keriotosse! is an action game for the Sega Saturn.     What a nice surprise this one was, looking more like a late generation PlayStation game rather than a Saturn game, Keriotosse! is one of those everyman for him self type fighting games. Well, I say fighting games but it's more like do anything possible to survive the battle. You and 3 friends or 3 CPU controlled characters if you're doing a one player game, take to an area in an all out battle to survive. Use any means necessary to survive including using the level's obstacles, your own magic or just brute force. All characters are 3D polygons yet look very nice indeed. The areas you battle within are also 3D based yet don't look it thanks to the quality textures used. There are also quite a few nice transparency effects on some of the levels.    Are you a big Poy Poy fan? Sad that such a game never came out on Saturn? Well, ease up, because Keriotosse! is here. In Keriotosse! 4 characters are dropped in 1-story arenas where the goal is to be the last person remaining. You eliminate your foes by kicking them out of the playing field, or you can use your designated special move to help knock them out
