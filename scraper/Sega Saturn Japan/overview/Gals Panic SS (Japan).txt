Gals Panic SS is the first game in the Gals Panic series designed specifically for home consoles. That said, there is no nudity. It is very similar to Gals Panic 4 before it in that all the girls are drawn in an anime style, with no photographic models whatsoever. The gameplay is changed in this game. The same basic gameplay of uncovering a girl's picture with Qix-like gameplay is used, but players spend 5 rounds on each girl.
