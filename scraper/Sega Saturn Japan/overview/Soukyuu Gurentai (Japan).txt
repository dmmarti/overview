Soukyugurentai, also known as Terra Diver, is a vertical- scrolling shooter by Raizing originally released as an arcade game for the ST-V platform in 1996. The Saturn port was released five months after the arcade release. Because the original arcade hardware was directly based on the Sega Saturn architecture, this is a close conversion of the original game. Several options and features were also added, including support for the Multi Controller and Mission Stick.
