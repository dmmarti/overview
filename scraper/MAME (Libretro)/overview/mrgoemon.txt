Goemon is based on Ishikawa Goemon, an infamous outlaw in 16th century Japan. Some stories tell of Goemon becoming a criminal after stealing from his cruel master and killing his pursuers. Later he becomes a merchant in Kyoto and Osaka by day and a thief by night. Whilst some remember him as simply a thief, others celebrate him as being a Japanese Robin Hood, robbing from the rich to give to the poor.
