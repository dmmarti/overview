Fantasy is a little mouse looking for delicious cheeses. But it has to kill its enemies (rats and beetles) with mines exploding after a few seconds. Fantasy uses rotating wood doors and activated metal doors to follow its way escaping from sparks or ice. Really funny, "Cheese Chase" is a mix of reflex and strategy.
