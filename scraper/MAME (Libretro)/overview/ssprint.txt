Like "Championship Sprint", released the same year, Super Sprint is an updated version of the old Atari Sprint series; with added the ability to allow players to upgrade their vehicles as the game progresses. Upgrades are won by collecting wrenches that appear once per track. After a player has collected four wrenches, they will be presented with an upgrade screen; giving them the opportunity to choose better traction, increased top speed, faster acceleration, or a faster helicopter. The only discernible difference between this and "Championship Sprint" is the addition of brand new tracks.
