Tang Tang is a platform/puzzle hybrid for one or two players; based heavily on Tecmo's superb 1986 release, "Solomon's Key - Solomon no Kagi". The players' characters are armed with a magic wand, which can be used to both destroy and create blocks to use as platforms and barriers. Players can remove platform blocks directly above their characters' heads by repeatedly jumping up into them until they break.    To complete a level, players must collect all of the circle/diamond items that litter each screen. Once all of these have been collected, a door will appear through which the player must exit to complete the level.
