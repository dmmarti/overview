The player would have a choice of race 'Easy Drive' or 'Technical Drive' (Auto Or Manual). Then the game would start in qualify (or Practice mode) successfully completing the course would then send the game into 'Grand Prix' mode. In both stages the player would be against an alloted time limit to get through the track.
