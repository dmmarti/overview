A great vertical shoot'em up game based on Greek mythology.      The player controls the sun god Apollo who is riding of his winged horse Pegasus flying through ancient Greece on a mission to rescue his sister Artemis the goddess of the moon, from the clutches of the fiend Typhon. Shoot all enemies like harpies and skeletons along with goblins and colossal enemy bosses.    Pressing the fire button makes his sword fire a tiny shot, while holding it down charges the sword, firing a bigger fireball upon release. Even the smallest enemies take multiple hits, so the standard shot is of little use.
