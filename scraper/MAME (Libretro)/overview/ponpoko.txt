Ponpoko  is a platform game similar to Donkey Kong and Mario Bros.     In Ponpoko, the player controls a Tanuki (a Japanese raccoon dog) that can climb ladders, walk across floors and jump over gaps and tacks while trying to avoid red and yellow snakes. The player must collect all the fruits and vegetables in order to advance to the next level. There are also baskets that contain either points or snakes. Once the final level is reached (the beer mug level) the game will repeat that level endlessly.
