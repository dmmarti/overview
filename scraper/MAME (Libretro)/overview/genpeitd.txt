Genpei Touma Den is a multi-genre birds-eye view action, 2D side-scroller beat 'em up, and 2D side-scroller platform arcade game that was released by Namco in 1986 only in Japan.     The character controlled by the player is that of a real Japanese samurai, Taira no Kagekiyo, who fell at the Battle of Dan-no-ura at the end of the Genpei War in 1185. Over eight hundred years later he is resurrected and has to make his way over the Imperial Regalia of Japan - fighting other characters who actually existed such as Minamoto no Yoshitsune and Saito Musashibo Benkei on his travels, as well as collecting the three sacred game items and defeating his arch-enemy Minamoto no Yoritomo.
