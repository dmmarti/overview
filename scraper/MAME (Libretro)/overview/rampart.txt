Rampart is a superb arcade puzzle game in which up to three players must build up a castle using Tetris shaped pieces to form a castle wall and enclose their keep. Each player must then place a limited number of cannons inside their castle wall before the timer expires. Once the cannons have been placed the battle itself begins. Players must target their cannons onto the enemy's castle (or, in the one-player game, enemy ships and peons) and destroy as much of the enemy army as possible before the time limit expires.     Once the battle is over the players must repair their castles, again using tetris shapes. The players' Keep must be completely encircled with castle wall or the game is over. In the single-player sea attack game, any enemy ships that manage to reach the coast nearest the player will unload peons that will attack the player's castle by land.
