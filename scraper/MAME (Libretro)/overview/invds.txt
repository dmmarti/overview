Invinco is a game inspired by "Space Invaders", with some innovation on the aliens: One row blinks in and out of view, another row's aliens roll so as to make themselves harder or easier to hit, and a 3rd row of aliens each take (at least) 3 hits to kill. A 4th row has aliens that turn into bombs, blowing up everything around them to make your job somewhat easier.    Deep Scan is a sub hunting game.
