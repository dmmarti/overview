Created in 1994, "Stone Ball" is a funny game between football, hockey and baseball which presents several teams of cavemen having more knowledge on fighting than on sport rules! Armed with big clubs, the players have to put a stone ball in the opposite cave. They can tackle, hustle or hit the opponents. Special bonus allow the cavemen to fire, burn or even bury their enemies...
