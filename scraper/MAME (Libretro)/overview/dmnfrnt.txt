Demon Front is a platform run 'n' Gun game for up to four players (two simultaneously) that is very reminscent of SNK's "Metal Slug" series, although there are significant additions to the gameplay.     20 light years from Earth lies the planet of Andres, a peaceful and civilised place. In the year A.C. 2016 Andres experienced a solar eclipse that lasted for over three months. All living creatures were exposed to a strange, dark red light and many began to mutate in both appearance and character. Few inhabitants would survive the torture inflicted by these crazed mutants.     A lucky few escaped and lived in exile. Four of the survivers decided to join forces, to fight back and overthrow the evil that dominates the planet.
