Three years after the so-called "Great Shinra War" comes to a close, its impact has yet to fade: the formerly-prosperous nation of Soma, one of the invasion's targets, still struggles to recover. In the midst of all this, Ageha and Tateha, along with their mother, newly freed from her self-imposed bonds, have retreated into hiding here, hoping to finally obtain some measure of peace for themselves. Little do they know that the country's researchers have been combing through the wreckage of Jakou's empire, in search of the secret behind the "spirit engine" - once the device's inner workings are finally deciphered, Soma's royal family quickly commences its own quest for military dominance. The children of Project Espgaluda find themselves hunted down once again, and are forced back into battle - this time around, though, they're not quite so alone.
