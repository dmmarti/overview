While similar to most vertical scrolling shooters, Omega Fighter is unique in its gameplay, level and enemy focus: rather than flying through multiple levels, the player faces an enormous space battle cruiser which contains every level.    There are two weapons that the player picks up, and if the player picks up a different powerup, it will always reset to its lowest level:  (I) - Ion Laser: Shoots straight, pick up more to increase damage at a cost of decreasing length. Ideal for close combat.  (W) - Wide Shot: Shoots bullets in wider range when collecting more of them. Ideal for taking enemies from afar but deals less damage.    There are also two items that are pressed by the bomb button, and players may pick up to two of them:  Silver - Activate to slow down everything on screen. Useful to dodge bullets and getting closer for higher score.  Gold - Destroy all enemies on screen, score depends on closeness to player prior to using the item.
