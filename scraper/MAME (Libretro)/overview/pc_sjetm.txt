The golden warpship was once the most powerful ship in the galactic fleet. But the ship was captured by aliens, and its parts scattered throughout twelve different worlds.

It is now up to Solar Jetman to land on each of the worlds and retrieve all the parts so the golden warpship may be reassembled.
