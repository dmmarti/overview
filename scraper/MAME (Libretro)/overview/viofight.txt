Control different characters with various fighting styles and engage in single or two-player bouts.    In the early 1950's, a game called Violence Fight was popular in the US crime world. Fighters from all over the USA would compete against each other to become that year's champion. The winner stood to make a considerable amount of money.     In downtown LA, a manager called Blinks is training up a new fighter called Bad Blue. He is a strong contender to become the champion and desperately needs the prize money.
