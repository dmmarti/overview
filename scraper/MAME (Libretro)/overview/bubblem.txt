Bubble Memories - The Story of Bubble Bobble III is the third and final arcade outing for Bub and Bob (not counting the 'Puzzle Bobble' series), Bubble Memories returns once more to the classic, single-screen gameplay of the series' legendary first outing.   Graphically, the game is very similar to 'Bobble Bobble II', released a year earlier; the only real visual difference between the two is the latter game's use of some rather charmless digitized animal photographs that form the game's backdrops.
