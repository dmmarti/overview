Two tanks face off in a maze of blocks. Besides dodging the bullets shot by the opponent, a player must also avoid running into mines. After the game timer expires, the player with the highest score wins.    The game is similar to the original "Tank" except the battlefields can be open or have mines and barriers and the tanks can be visible or invisible depending on how the options are selected.
