This game is a ripoff of both Starcraft's Brood War and Warcraft II by Blizzard. All ingame backgrounds, selection screens and end-of-level animations, sound effects are taken from Starcraft, and all ingame BGMs are orcish horde themes of warcraft II(FM synthesizer music). The explosions are the same as in "Mega Man X4", X5, and X6. They really standout from the PC backgrounds.    This probably wanted to be a sort of 'shoot 'em up' port of this game. Also the gameplay is apparently a rip, but from Psikyo shoot 'em ups, as ingame icons and fonts are identical to Psikyo ones...
