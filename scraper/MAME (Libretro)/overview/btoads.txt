Battletoads is a (mostly) horizontally-scrolling beat-em-up in which up to three players take on the roles of Rash, Pimple, or Zitz and must punch and kick their way through six enemy-infested stages to save their alternate universe from the Dark Queen.    The Toads each vary in fighting style: Rash is nimble, Pimple is burly and strong, and Zitz is a balance of the two. Each Toad also has its own signature exaggerated power and attack, in which their limbs turn into objects such as axes and drills.    In a visually unique twist, the Toads can knock the game's enemies 'off-screen' so that they appear to fly towards the players, breaking the fourth wall. Enemies include aliens, mutant rodents and snowmen.    The game's stages, in addition to having their own unique visual theme, often differ in gameplay style. Some levels are Double Dragon-style 2.5D brawlers, while others are strictly two-dimensional, platform-like stages. In one level, the Toads wear jet-packs and descend a tunnel and in the final level, the Toads shoot enemies from a vehicle.
