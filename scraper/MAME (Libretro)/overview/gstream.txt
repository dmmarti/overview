Shooter from Oriental soft, heavy influence from "XII Stag" as well as "Trizeal". Three weapons may be carried and their power controlled by picking up capsules of a specific colour.    Three capsule types:  Red - Vulcan  Green - Missiles  Blue - Laser    Points are awarded by picking up medals which are released from shot down enemies. The medal value and appearance is increased as long as you don't miss any.    When enough medals have been picked up a 'void' bomb becomes available which when released (hold down main shot) will create a circular void. Enemy bullets which hit this void are transformed into medals. If you place your ship inside this void it becomes invulnerable.
