You are Andrew, the one man team. Ord and Clee are robots whose goal is to destroy you any way they can (by driving you against the boards, into a spinner, or by hitting you with a supercharged ball). Knock out Ord and Clee with your ball or by hitting them against the sides. Points are also scored by hitting the goal and hitting the targets on the sides.
