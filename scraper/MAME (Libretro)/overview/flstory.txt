The Fairyland Story is a precursor to 1986's "Bubble Bobble", the player controls a spell-casting elf who turns evil wizards, witches and other enemies into cakes and either pushes them from the platform ledges, or shoots then repeatedly to destroy them. If an enemy touches the player character, the elf becomes entrapped in a magic bubble and floats away. Each level takes place inside a variety of castles.
