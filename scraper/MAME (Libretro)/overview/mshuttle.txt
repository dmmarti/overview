Moon Shuttle is a game where at first you have to shoot moon rocks to get out, then after that fight some enemies. The cycle repeats after that. The voice sampling in the game doesn't say what the words on the screen say. For example, when it says on the screen 'Never Give Up', the voice is actually saying 'Hang in there!'.
