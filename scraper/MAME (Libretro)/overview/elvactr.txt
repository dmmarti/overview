Elevator Action Returns is a scrolling platform shoot-em-up for one or two players who each take on the role of a special task force operative and must foil a terrorist group that has planted nuclear bombs in various facilities. Players must also obtain the secret intelligence data scattered throughout each facility in order to disarm the bombs.     The objective of the game is to enter all of the red-coloured doors in each stage, then proceed to the exit.
