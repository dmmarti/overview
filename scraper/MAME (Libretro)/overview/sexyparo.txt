The 3rd sequel in a hugely successful series of games that was originally intended to be little more than a parody of Konami's own successful "Gradius" series. As the previous "Parodius" games, "Sexy Parodius" again gives the player a choice of increasingly bizarre ships to control; ranging from a sexy girl riding a missile, to a stick man on a paper aeroplane.
The game plays much the same as its prequels, as well as the 'Gradius' series it sets out to parody. One new addition to the game-play is the introduction of branching paths through the game. Each level has a specific task, such as collecting the golden coins on the second level, the completion or failure of which dictates which level players will be faced with next.
Due to the powerful Konami GX hardware the game runs on, Sexy Parodius's colorful and inventive visuals represent the pinnacle of the series.
