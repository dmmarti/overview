Each level is a maze of varying openness. Monsters spawn from colorful fires that must be extinguished to complete the level. The character can attack with three blasts of liquid before becoming empty. With each blast of liquid, the character moves faster and gets closer to being an empty outline with pink shoes. When empty the character is a shell of a sprite, but can move more quickly. Liquid is replenished by drinking (guzzling) from puddles. Occasionally, an alcoholic beverage will appear in the center of the screen. If the player picks up this beverage, liquid supply fills to maximum and the fires temporarily freeze.
