CHALLENGER is the newest video game to be introduced by Centuri. With its vivid colors and lively setting, it is sure to lure the most ardent player into game action.    The game consists of 16 sectors (rounds) of play. Sector 1 begins with Large Energy Rings floating randomly across the screen. The Spaceship must avoid colliding with the Rings, or it will explode into a starburst of brilliant colors. The Spaceship dodges the Energy Rings by moving right or left across the playfield, while bursting them with the Spaceship's 3-directional guns. Bursting the Large Rings (100 points) breaks them into Medium Rings. Bursting the Medium Rings (200 points) breaks them into Small Rings. Bursting the Small Rings (400 points) causes them to disintegrate.
