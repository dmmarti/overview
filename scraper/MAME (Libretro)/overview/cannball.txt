This game is exactly a crossover between "Arkanoid" and "Puzzle Bobble". You have a paddle and must shoot the ball on the same color ball on the screen. You have to make three balls in the same color to drop them. You can drop lot of colors attachced, the same as "Puzzle Bobble". When you shoot the ball, you have three solutions : Draw the ball 45 degrees to the left, draw the ball normally, or draw the ball 45 degrees to the right. If you are in difficulty, you can shoot a bomb. When the game is over, if you continue, you restart at previous stage!
