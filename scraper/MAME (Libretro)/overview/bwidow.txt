"Robotron - 2084" players will feel right at home playing this game, as the controls are identical. You have to defend your little vector spider around her vector web in order to keep out all the deadly bugs. Shoot down bugs and they turn into bonuses. Watch out for eggs, if you see any eggs, then you should quickly push them off the web before they hatch. Other enemies include mosquitoes, beetles, and hornets.
