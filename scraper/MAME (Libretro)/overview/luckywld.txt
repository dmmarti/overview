Lucky &amp; Wild is a hilarious 'drive 'n shoot' game starring two buddy cops on a mission to bring down a mafia gang. Player 1 (Lucky) both drives the car and fires a gun, Player 2 (Wild) uses just a gun. While playing, both cops trade funny banter and dialogue, and even make funny faces in the rearview mirror.
