A racing game in which up to eight players (via linked cabinets) compete in a lap-based race around one of three testing courses. After each lap, the slowest car is eliminated and the game continues until only the winner remains. In the single-player game, the player competes against a field of A.I. controlled cars.    Each player selects one car from the ten that are available, then chooses their preferred track (Beginner, Advanced or Expert). The action is fast and furious and the game can vary between one and nine laps, depending upon the number of rival players. An on-screen map in the upper right-hand corner of the display indicates the positions of all rival racers.
