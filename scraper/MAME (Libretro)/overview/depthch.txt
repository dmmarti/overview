Depthcharge is a 2-Dimensional shooter. You control your destroyer on the surface of the water while submarines patrol underneath. Your job is to drop depth charges to eliminate these submarines. The submarines aren't defenseless as they launch mines straight up toward your ship.    Depthcharge was one of the early video games. Action was simple. This game also had the ability to retain the highest score (without the initials of course). Although the game is simple in concept, just trying to get enough points was enough to keep you working at it. Good luck on your submarine hunting mission.
