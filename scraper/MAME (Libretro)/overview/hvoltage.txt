Once upon a time, man on the Earth concentrated all the power of superlative science to control the universe and changed it into force of arms. We repressed the galactic system where high grade creature lived, and expanded his territory successively. However, it is 3030 now and we ruled over huge country. But, it became too large to do ot. The eye could not have reached at last in all parts of the heavenly bodies and rebellion arose here and there......and finally big revolt rose in a country named Regit. The rebel army extended their power rapidly, centering around their territory and made haste to build up a thorou ghly strengthened country. To control this, we headed on to Regit in High Voltage.
