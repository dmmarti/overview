Space Launcher is a game by Nintendo that was surprisingly original - the game is similar to Frogger, though is not a clone since it predates it by at least two years.     The game takes place in space, and your goal is to maneuver around space objects and dodge oncoming enemy fire from the aliens that are stationed above. There are treasures at the top: and your goal is to fly up, grab the treasure, and come soaring back down. You must repeat this until all of the treasures have been scavenged.
