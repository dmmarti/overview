Dodgem is a 2-D maze racing game. You control your boat through the maze to pick up the dots while at the same time avoiding the boat, or boats, that are constantly trying to ram you. Successfully get through one maze and many more await you. This is good practice for sailing through Hong Kong Harbor.
