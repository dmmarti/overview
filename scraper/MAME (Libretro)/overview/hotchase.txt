An action-packed driving game in which the player must drive a stolen enemy 'Super-car' - which has a bomb strapped to the underside of its chassis - and get to the country's border before the timer runs down and the bomb explodes. Enemy troops, road-blocks, planes and helicopters must all be avoided.
