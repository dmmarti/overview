Successfully defend the city while defeating the attacking alien fleets. The buildings function as your hit points, and the integrity of the individual buildings is displayed in green bars within your HUD at the bottom of the screen. Once all buildings are destroyed the game ends. Enemy bombs can be shot down before impact to prevent damage to buildings. Use bombs to defeat large enemies.
