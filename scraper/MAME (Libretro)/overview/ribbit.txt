Ribbit! is a one or co-operative two-player abstract arcade game and is an unofficial sequel to Konami's seminal 1981 release, "Frogger".    Unlike its legendary prequel (in which players had to guide a frog to his home at top of each screen without being killed) the aim here is to guide a toad around a screen, eating benign insects - such as Ants and Dragon-flies - while avoiding harmful ones - such as Spiders and Rats. A level is only complete once a set amount of insects have been eaten.
