Rail Chase is a lightgun controlled one or two player shooting game, in which the players travel in a minecart through a huge rail network; pursued by a multitude of weapon-carrying enemies. The fast-paced action also features sections in which the player comes across junctions in the track and can chose whether to go left or right - the chosen route usually dictating how many tack obstacles and enemies the player must face - this is achieved by shooting the signposts that are situated in the middle of the points. Some sections also have the player's minecart leave the track entirely and travel over open ground.
