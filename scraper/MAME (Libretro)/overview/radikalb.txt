A game set in a Mediterranean environment in which, for the first time, players have the chance to show off their motor-cycle skills in a typically Italian urban setting. The game is a competition between two pizza delivery couriers in a race to see who can deliver their pizza first. The urban circuit allows interaction with all kinds of elements: cars, vans, windows, fences, people, etc. To help you complete your mission, you can collect icons giving you more speed, power or time. Hidden shortcuts help you gain valuable seconds.    You must choose from four pizza couriers each with his or her own particular abilities. There are three game levels: Margherita (easy), Capricciosa (medium) &amp; Diavolo (difficult). There are four different races at each level which allow you to show the other biker who has the most skill, daring and ability.
