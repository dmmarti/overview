M.I.A. - Missing in Action Â© 1989 Konami.  M.I.A. Missing in Action is a horizontally-scrolling run 'n' gun platform game for one or two players in which Special Forces soldiers must penetrate enemy-packed combat zones to reach a POW compound and rescue captured prisoners. The rescued POWs must then be escorted safely through a final enemy-packed stage to the helicopter that awaits at the end.   Players begin each stage armed with only a combat knife to protect them, but other weapons can be picked up from fallen enemy troops. The weapons are always carried by soldiers in red uniforms and range from an assault rifle, grenades, a flame-thrower and a bazooka. Players can carry more than one weapon and can cycle through them as needed. Each collected weapon has only a limited supply of shots.  The game's first four stages are presented in random order and may also be "mirrored", switching the action from from right-to-left instead of left-to-right, increasing the game's variety and adding replay value. The 'POW' and 'Helicopter' stages are always the last two stages, however.   At the end of each stage players must fight off a wave of enemy troops as well as destroy gun emplacements and watch towers. Certain sections of each stage offer players a different route, with both platforms and underground tunnels that can be utilized and explored. At least one POW must be safely escorted to the rescue Chopper to complete the final mission, after which the game starts over with an increased level of difficulty.  The game consists of six stages: War-torn battlefield Airstrip Jungle Rail Yard POW Base Escort the POWs to the Helicopter  M.I.A. Missing in Action is the direct sequel to 1985's "Green Beret" but unlike its prequel, two-player games now have both players fighting side-by-side, rather than the alternating approach of the original game.
