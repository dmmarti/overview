Rabid-Media rates this game: 4/5This one's just plain rediculous! you are some fat guy in a suit. there is a small screen filled with other suited guys, a rolling barrel, and bars of gold. your job is to get those bars of gold and bring them to the building with the word, "IN" on it. Kinda like flicky, you can bring some over to it, then get the rest seperately, but you will get less points this way. the graphics are nice and vivid (for an 80's sega arcade game.) and the animations are just plain silly, and sometimes disturbing (when you get caught by a suited man, he then is in a blackÂ bikini beating you with a whip!) you can combat these perverst by punching them, sometimes repeatedly. you must jump over the barrel to avoid it most of the time. as far as arcade games go, it's definately a fun, challenging product of Japanese insanity! try it!
