In a different time than now...    A time when deserts spread across the Earth,  and arthropods with gigantic hard shells flourished.    The humans living in the shadows called these beasts  with shells who worshipped the god of the forest for Koujuu.    In a small part of that forest was the village of the humans. It was a land that was allowed go on surviving, by offering a sacrifice in the form of a 15 year old once every 200 years.    On the night of each sacrifice, a great number of shooting stars could be seen, which gave it the name "Hoshifuri Village". And living there was a bright princess. Her name was Reco.
