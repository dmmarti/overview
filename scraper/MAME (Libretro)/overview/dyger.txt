Dyger is a 2D vertically scrolling shoot 'em up game in which you take control of a lone pilot and her spaceship. A commando group known as Dyger is responsible for the protection of Earth. In 2125 a female member of Dyger accidentally detonates an atomic weapon that destroys a city. After four years of feeling guilty, she decides to cryogenically freeze herself.    In 2188, Earth is invaded by an alien host. After an earthquake in 2189 she awakens. Soon realizing Earth has been overrun, she decides to redeem herself by taking on the alien hordes herself.     As you make progress and fight off various spacecraft, static guns, tanks, ships and bosses, power-ups come available. The spacecraft has separate weapons for flying and ground-based units/ships. The game can be played solo or with a friend.
