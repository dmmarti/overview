A "Pac-man" style game with Pac-Man and Pocket Monster (Pok'n) characters. Player 1 controls Puckman and Player 2 controls Pikachu's head. Trying to catch you are the Ghost Monsters from the Pac-man games along with some Pocket Monsters. Get the 'power fruit' and you can eat them instead. When you complete a level, you are shown a digitized photograph of an Asian woman for some reason.
