At the flick of a switch, a white car approaches. You must avoid it and select the safest course, in a maze. When the first formation of dots is extinguished, 2 opposite cars dash at you from the upper screen. You must avoid them and run over the Lion and Snake in order to score bonus mystery points... Never be off guard, skid zones are dangerous! When 4 patterns are cleared, 3 cars rush at you!! Only skilled players make it!!
