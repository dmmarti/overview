Super Burger Time Â© 1990 Data East.  Peter Pepper returns almost eight years after the original Burger Time - and this time, there are more evil things in his way, more tools to deal with them (the classic pepper, a skewer, a frying pan, even a water hose), and bigger burgers to assemble. You even have to fight bosses, by heaving hamburgers at them!
