farscape says:Aleck64 was a arcade console manufactured in the late 90's by SETA Corporation. It's architecture was very closely modeled after the Nintendo 64 console's hardware, but designed for specialty cabinets. The company also produced titles for NES and SNES. As for the Aleck64, (which utilized a Peripheral Interchange Format to load the game data) only a few titles were ever published and the company was eventually dissolved and faded into obscurity.
