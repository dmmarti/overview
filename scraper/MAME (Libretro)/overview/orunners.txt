Between 1 and 8 players (the latter requiring the use of link-up cabinets) compete in this colourful update of the 1986 classic, "Out Run". Out Runners features the multiple routes of the original but this time includes a large number of selectable vehicles; each of which poses different strengths and weaknesses, such as higher speed or better handling. Out Runners captures of the spirit of Out Run adding characters, humour, numerous selectable soundtracks (including a radio broadcast of the race by Jake Elwood) and a seamless driving experience barely interrupted by crashes.
