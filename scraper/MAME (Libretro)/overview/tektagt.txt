Tekken Tag Tournament is a 'Dream Match' Iron Fist Tournament, and it does not have a plot fitting within the Tekken story timeline. The game is an enhanced version of Tekken 3 including a new Tag feature - where the player selects two fighters and can change between characters during gameplay, and perform tag-team combos. The first side to have a character to be knocked out is the loser. The character list includes almost (if not all) characters from all 3 previous games.
