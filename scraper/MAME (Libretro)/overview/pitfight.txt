Three digitized brawlers face off co-operatively against a variety of street thugs, with gameplay featuring crowd interference and usable weapons. Players also get to fight each other in a 'Grudge Match'. Pit-Fighter featured impressive camera zoom and side-to-side pan but was somewhat flawed as a gameplay experience. On the dedicated cabinet version, up to three players can play simultaneously.
