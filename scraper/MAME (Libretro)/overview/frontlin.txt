Front Line is Taito America Corporation's action war game. Traveling through enemy territory the player must accomplish the ultimate mission or meet a violent end: capture the enemy fort and win total victory.    The journey begins slowly with the player armed with a gun (special Gun Control) and hand grenades. Quickly he becomes a target for enemy soldiers who also have guns and grenades. Moving faster, he races past trees that hide the enemy who now unleash an ambush barrage of bullets and bombs. Even the ground he races over has been booby-trapped with land mines.
