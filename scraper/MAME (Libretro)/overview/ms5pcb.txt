The latest installment of the most famous arcade-shooting series brings a lot of changes: this time, you will not face Morden's army like in the previous games, but with a new group of enemies that composes the already mentioned Ptolemaic Army. More content in this title, 3 guns and 2 vehicles from past games were reincorporated, as well as all brand new stuff of 3 vehicles. The most important addition is a sliding move: pressing the B Button when ducking will make your character slide for a short time in the ground. You are not be able to throw grenades, but your gun can be fired normally.
