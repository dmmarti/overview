X-Men is a side-scrolling beat-em-up for up to four players. The X-Men's mission is to find and rescue Professor X, who has been captured by evil mutants and is now being held prisoner by Magneto.    Each X-Man character has an 'Attack', 'Jump' and 'Mutant Power' button. The mutant power attack is a powerful special move unique to each X-Man. While it inflicts a lot of damage on the enemies, the trade-off is that each usage removes 3 bars from the players health meter (a full meter has 10 bars). Each level ends with a face-off against a powerful mutant boss character.    The game has six stages, with the final one set on 'Asteroid M', Magneto's base. The defeated mutant bosses from the previous levels each make an appearance (albeit in a less powerful form) before the final encounter with Magneto himself.    Players can chose from 6 X-Men characters, they are:  Cyclops   Colossus   Wolverine   Storm   Nightcrawler   Dazzler
