A horizontally scrolling fighting game for 1 to 4 players. Each playable character (chosen from Mark, Glen, Akira and Gil) kicks and punches their way through a number of enemy-packed levels. In addition to kicking and punching, each character also has their own unique 'special attack'; a move that injures multiple on-screen enemies at the cost of some of the player's health.    While in no way original (drawing most of its inspiration from Capcom's "Final Fight"), Karate Blazers is both hugely playable and very fast and frenetic, with the amount of on-screen enemies at times overwhelming. The graphics are also well drawn and nicely animated.
