The Ninja Kids is a horizontally-scrolling hack 'n' slash beat-em-up for up to four players who must defeat a demented cult plotting to summon Satan. A karate sensei sends out his four ninja puppets to combat this looming threat.     All four ninjas carry different weapons and have different fighting styles. As well as their weapons, each ninja also has a screen-filling magical attack based on one of four elements (earth, fire, wind and water).
