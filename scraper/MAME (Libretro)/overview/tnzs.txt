Set in Antipodean country of the game's title, The New Zealand Story is an eight-way scrolling platform game featuring Tiki the Kiwi bird. Tiki and his friends have been kidnapped by the evil 'Wally', a large blue leopard seal who wants the birds for his next meal. Tiki quickly escapes and sets about rescuing his trapped friends.      The game's stages are made up of platforms with a caged kiwi bird awaiting rescue at the end of each. Touching the cage releases the trapped Kiwi and an open window appears, indicating the completion of the stage.
