A sprite-scaling racing game based heavily on the Taito classic, "Chase H.Q.", Round Up 5 sees a single player take on the role of a law enforcement officer who must arrest five criminals.     As well as the Miami Vice-esque gameplay theme, Round Up also borrows the fork-in-the-road level design of the Taito classic; an idea that was itself taken from Sega's 1986 legend, "Out Run".
