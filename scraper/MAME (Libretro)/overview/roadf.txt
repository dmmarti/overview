Road Fighter is an exhilarating, high-speed scrolling racing game.    A unique characteristic of Road Fighter is the fact that bumping into an enemy car does not count as a miss. The counter-steering technique required to 'straighten' your car after bumping into an enemy provided a new level of racing game fun to fans.
