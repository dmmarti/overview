Warrior Blade is a fantasy-themed hack-and-slash game for one or two players, featuring both horizontal and vertically scrolling levels. Unlike previous Rastan games that featured only Rastan himself, players can now choose to play as one of three different warriors: Rastan, Dewey (a hireling) or Sophia (a thief).    Players must then fight their way through a multitude of enemy-packed levels set in a variety of different locations, such as castles, a forest, a swamp and on board a sinking ship. Certain levels also have the players riding on animals, such as horses and dragons. Coins and treasure items can be found in the numerous barrels and chests that litter the levels, as well as being dropped by some defeated enemies. Bonus points and "vitality" - depending on the amount of treasure collected - are awarded upon the level's completion.
