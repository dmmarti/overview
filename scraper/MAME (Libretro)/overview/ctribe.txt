Three player simultaneous melee battle in which larger-than-life fighters battle against rival gang members. As well as being able to pick up objects such as motorcycles etc. and throw them at the enemies, players also have a number of interesting fighting moves that can be unleashed upon their opponents. These include picking up unconscious enemies and hitting OTHER enemies with them, as well as banging two enemies' heads together and smashing recumbent enemies' heads into the ground to finish them off.
