An early 3-D shoot'em up game.    Pilot your ship through vast zones and large tubular vortex levels full of enemies. The vast zones are similar in gameplay to William's Blaster, while the tubular levels are similar to Konami's Gyruss. Upon the completion of the tubular levels, the player must dock with the mothership.    Good luck, fighter pilot!
