The player controls Sea Dog, who must feed Devil Fish in order to make them trap themselves on the several passages of the maze, as they will be too fat to advance. When they are trapped, Sea Dog must touch them. Immediately after that, a little house will appear on the center of the maze. Touch it and a part of a drawing will be revealed. Repeat this procedure until the complete image is revealed and Sea Dog will move on to the next level.
