Rolling Thunder 2 is a straight sequel to the superb 1986 original, Rolling Thunder 2 sees one or two players taking control of secret agents in this scrolling, platform shoot-em-up. The agents once again find themselves up against the sinister GERDRA organization and its many armed agents. Gameplay is very similar to the original, with doors both releasing enemies and hiding weapons and ammunition for the players to collect.
