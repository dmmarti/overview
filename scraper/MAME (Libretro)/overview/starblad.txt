Starblade is a 3-D space shoot'em up featuring 2 separate missions; the first is to destroy the planet 'Red Eye' while the second is to wipe out the enemy fleet and their leader. The game's sit-down cabinet featured a seat that vibrated whenever the player was hit, either by incoming fire or by enemy objects such as ships, asteroids etc. The yoke joystick - which had a fire button situated at the top of the stick, underneath where the player's thumb sits - was very similar in appearance and feel to that used in Atari's 1983 wireframe classic, "Star Wars (Atari)".
