A great underwater shooter game.    The player start on an dive propulsion vehicle that can fire torpedoes. The mission is to rescue all the hostages and avoid or shoot all enemies that come your way to attack you. If your vehicle runs out of fuel can explode to avoid this must be attentive to the fuel indicator, if your tank is almost finished press the dismount button to get off the vehicle. Now the player is swimming freely and your weapon is a powerful harpoon. If you kill the owner of another dive vehicle you can mount it and use torpedoes again. The number of hostages to rescue increases with each level. When all the hostages have been rescued, the level ends.
