Konami's Ping Pong is a playable if simplistic Table Tennis simulation for one or two players. Ping Pong offers three different types of shot; Top spin, Back Spin and Smash. The actual gameplay centers on shot timing and shot choice, with the players' bats moving automatically to track the movement of the ball.    In the single player mode, the player can opt to play the game on any one of five different skill levels.
