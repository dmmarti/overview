Rong Rong is a style of solitaire mahjong, much like "Shanghai" with 3 modes of play, 'sexy girls', 'rong rong', and 'battle mode'. All 3 modes feature the same basic style of gameplay. Rong Rong is the basic story mode where finishing each level furthers the storyline. 'Battle mode' is a two player game where two players on a split-screen compete to clear the same board of tiles first. 'Sexy girls' mode involves clearing the board to reveal a scantily clad model in the background. In 'Sexy girls' mode there are additional mini-games between levels which, when completed successfully reveal more risque images of the girl featured in the level.
