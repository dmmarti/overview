Guardian Storm (known in Korea as Jeon Sin, and mistakenly in MAME as Sen Jin) is a vertical shoot 'em up developed by Afega and published by Apple Industries. Released in May 1998, it has eight stages. Players collect gold that they can trade in for power-ups, bombs, and extra lives between stages.  Guardian Storm runs on the same shooting engine as Red Hawk, so it can be considered as a kind of sequel. The design, however, is much more cartoony, even though the advertisement for the Western release doesn't show it at all. One of the characters is Sun Wukong on a cloud, and there's some crazy enemies like the Dol Hareubang statues of Jeju Island. Powerup pickups during the stages have become much rarer now, more enemies now drop money instead, which can be used to buy upgrades in a store after each stage, but usually spending power is very limited, which is the major reason for this game being much harder than Red Hawk. Guardian Storm was also quite successful internationally.
