You take control of a giant war robot in a futuristic war zone to battle with other similarly massive and horribly be-weaponed robots. The game is filled with 3D graphics and animations. The game has different war zones to test your robot skills, the later ones are pure mayhem, with mega powerful warbots blasting you with laser beams, plasma cannons and even nuclear missiles.
