The evil King Lion has crowned himself as the master of Fuun-Ken, a new style of martial arts that includes throwing weapons in addition to hand-to-hand combat. This does not sit well with the rest of the Fuun-Ken fighters around the world, so they all decide to beat each other up in classic 2 round fights to decide who gets to get down with King Lion himself.  Savage Reign is a one-on-one 2D fighter in which you select your character and try to defeat all challengers using your basic attacks and special moves. The game features 2 different horizontal planes to which the characters can freely jump to in order to avoid attacks a la Fatal Fury. You cannot escape completely however, as all characters have a throwing weapon they can use in different ways to reach each other no matter where they are.
