The seven magical Waku Waku balls have surfaced once again and the few that know of their existence decide to battle against each other in order to collect them all. If they are able to defeat the powerful monster enslaved in them, the Waku Waku balls will grant the lucky victor whatever wish they desire. The game was created as a parody of animé series in general, WW7 pools together all the mainstays of the genre and has them fight against each other. From furry catgirls and effeminate, super-cool elfs to cute pokémon-like creatures and dumb and loud heroes.
