Shadow Force is a side-scrolling platform beat-em-up for one or two players, who choose to play as one of four Ninjas and must use all the means at their disposal to free the world from the grip of the evil Dr. Wong and his terrifying 'Theaser' organization.    Shadow Force has 6 buttons: 2 for punches (low and high) 2 for kicks (low and high) 1 for jumping and 1 for possessing an enemy. Additional attack moves can be utilised by moving the joystick up or down and pressing punch and kick buttons. It's also possible to combine punch and kick attacks to obtain different combos and while the enemies can do the same, the number and variation of their attacks is generally lower than those available to the players.    In addition to being able to possess nearby enemies, Shadow Force also features something else new to the side-scrolling beat-em-up genre; at the end of each stage players take part in a bonus round consisting of a one-on-one fight.     Players can choose to start on any one of the first three stages and the game features 14 different possible endings.
