Senjyo is an arcade game developed in 1983 by Tehkan (now known as Tecmo). The gameplay involves the player controlling a fixed turret on a tank shooting oncoming alien enemies through a cross-hair target. A certain number of enemies must be destroyed to progress to the next stage. The original arcade cabinet was a cocktail table.
