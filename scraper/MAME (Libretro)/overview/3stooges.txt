The 3 Stooges are searching for their fiancees, kidnapped by the Mad Scientist. Looking at the art gallery, they quickly turn it into a disaster area!  In all rooms, the Stooges need to destroy the furniture and find the 3 hidden keys that unlock the exit. Using their hammers, Moe, Larry &amp; Curly bang away!  Interfering socialites and cops are dealt with in typical Stooges style: a face slap, a hammer to the noggin, or the ever-dependable cream pie.  Bonus round: Avoid the sour notes of the opera singer as you collect the three keys to the exit. And watch out for the cops, too!  In the Mad Scientist's laboratory, the Stooges rescue Cora, the first fiancee. That leaves Nora and Dora still in danger! Let the game continue!    DON'T MISS OUT ON THIS SUMMER'S HIT VIDEO!
