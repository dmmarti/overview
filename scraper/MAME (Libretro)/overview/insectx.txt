Battle against the insect army with your special insecticide weapons.    The Burgoid, a tribe of midgets with dreams of conquest, have turned insects into cyborgs and formed them into a vast army which is now on the move and intending to invade planet Earth!     To wipe out these mega-insects - which are invulnerable to ordinary weapons - humans have created an insect-sized warrior called Yanmer. The warrior wears a suit, giving him special powers and wings that are more efficient than a jet engine.     You are Yanmer, and your mission is to destroy the Burgoid Monarch and save mankind from disaster!
