Another digitized fighter attempting to cash in on the "Mortal Kombat" craze featuring eight selectable characters and bonus rounds. The producers of this game must have raided the discount Halloween costume boutique. I cannot help but giggle each time I fight Dantel, the incredibly cheap and hilarious white trash ripoff of Shang Tsung.
