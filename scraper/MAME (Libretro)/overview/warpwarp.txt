The objective of the game is to pursue the mystery aliens by warping across 2 different worlds: the Space World and Maze World.  The player may choose when to warp to a different world, so it is possible to continue playing in the same world throughout the game. In Space World, the character uses a gun to shoot up enemy aliens, and in Maze World, aliens are killed using a time-delay bomb. The delay is controlled by the length of time the button is held down, and the player loses if the character is caught in the resulting explosion.    Power-ups may appear on some levels, and allow the player to shoot exploding bullets or attach bombs directly onto enemy aliens. However, the exploding bullets usable in Space World can only obtained in Maze World, and the power-up to attach bombs onto enemies in Maze World only appears in Space World. Players must alternate turns on the screen in the multiplayer mode.
