This maze game is quite similar to "Pac-Man". The player controls a caterpillar that crawls along the branches of a maze-like tree eating nuts and strawberries while avoiding deadly bugs and a hungry bird. The caterpillar changes into a butterfly after everything has been eaten.    The caterpillar must eat all the strawberries and nuts on each level to become a butterfly. Eating a strawberry temporarily makes the caterpillar invincible allowing it to kill the deadly bugs and score 400 bonus points ber bug. If the caterpillar remains still for too long, an invincible owl (replaced by an invincible bat in later levels) will appear. If your catepillar moves, the owl or bat will disappear.  If your catepillar remains still, the invincible owl or bat will chase the caterpillar, albiet not very effrctively.      When the caterpillar crosses over a pivot branch, all the branches will rotate at once, and any bugs that are on those branches will fall off and score 400, 800, 1600 and 3200 points, depending on the amount of bugs killed. Keep an eye out for the flowers that will appear below the house - they will reward you between 400 and 3200 points, depending on the level.
