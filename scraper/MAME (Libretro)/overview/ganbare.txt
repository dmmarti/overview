Ganbare Marin-kun is the final and probably rarest game released on CPS1. I don't know anyone who had even heard of it until it showed up for sale. It's a medal game but along with Tobikose Jumpman and Alien, the best of them I have seen. The music rips off several things including the Indiana Jones theme song.
