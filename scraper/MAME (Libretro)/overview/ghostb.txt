Adapted from the animated cartoon of the same name. Up to three players, each controlling a Ghostbuster, must run around a top-down universal scrolling terrain, shoot creatures and then try to suck up ghosts with their plasma guns. Players can shoot and then collect various power-ups, including a protective Aura, shot and beam boosters, and a "Green Ghost" Slimer shield satellite. Has interesting screen transition effects and a well-orchestrated version of the movie's popular theme song.
