Atari's Monte Carlo is a 1-player video game that simulates driving in a grand prix race. Various video-display phrase indicate score, time elapsed ('FUEL'), speed and which track was selected at the beginning of the game (eight different ones ranging from easy to hard). Players drive the grand prix car through the streets, while spectators observe from the side. Bales of hay, cola stands, trees, and bushes also line the roadway.    Four computer-controlled cars provide challenge: they pass the player's car at high speed and may cause it to skid or even crash. However, the computer cars are not unfailable and may also skid or crash occasionally. Realistic engine revving, screeching tires and crash sounds accompany game play.
