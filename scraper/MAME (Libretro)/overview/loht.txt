Legend of hero Tonma brings back memories of a real arcade prestige. We played it day and night with tons of coins just to make one another envy our Tonma skills.     This is one of the few real arcade run and gun platformers with so much spirit in it.     As Tonma you jump and shoot your magic finger, upgrading it and fighting the old demon king. Just a perfect setting for a teenage boy gameplay from the early nineties.
