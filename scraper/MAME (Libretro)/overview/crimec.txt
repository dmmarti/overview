Crime City is a side-scrolling platform shoot-em-up for one or two players in which two cops by the names of Tony Gibson and Raymond Brody are tasked with taking down the gangs of criminals that have overrun their city.     Each of the game's six stages focuses on a specific criminal activity, such as bank robbery or smuggling. The goal of each stage is to reach the powerful 'boss' character then defeat and arrest them.
