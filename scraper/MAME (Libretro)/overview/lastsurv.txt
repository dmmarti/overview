You are with up to 2 players trapped in a maze with a load of other tough guys and monsters. You have a single key to the exit of the maze. To get out you need four keys. The only way to get them off other players is to kill them. First one to exit the maze wins.    Each player has a separate screen that shows, roughly, a fist person view of the maze. You can move right/left, up/down along the corridors and also rotate. You also have a weapon, a kind of gun that you can get upgraded if you stop at the shop  in the maze and have earned enough money by creaming the resident enemies on that level. Here you can also buy extra speed and armor that will absorb a few hits.
