Teddy Boy Blues - Yohko Ishino is a strange and unique platform game by Sega. Guide Teddy Boy through an ever scrolling maze to defeat ninjas, snails, big mouthed hippos and other bizarre creatures.    You shoot your enemies with a gun that shrinks them - then you must collect your shrunken foes for bonus points. If you don't collect them quick enough, they will fly down to the bottom of the screen and eat a portion of your time meter.
