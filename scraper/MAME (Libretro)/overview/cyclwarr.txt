You control a bike rider that must punch enemy bikers, destroy gyrocopters dropping bombs on you and road-blocking end-of-level nasties. While you're riding into the screen you can ride further forward and decelerate back to add an extra dimension of movement. When you pull back you practically get your sprite to fill the whole screen. You can jump over cars backwards and forwards as well as landing on their roofs, as they receive more damage large chunks of bodywork fly off until they finally explode.
