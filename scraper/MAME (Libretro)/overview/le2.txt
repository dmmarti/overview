Western style shooting game featuring digitized characters. The game consists of 5 stages: Bank Robbery, Stage Hold-Up, Saloon Showdown, Train Robbery, and Hide-Out.     The player begins the game holding the rank of Sheriff, but if too many innocents or fellow lawmen are killed, the player can be demoted to Deputy or even Posse member. Complete a stage without killing any innocents, and the player is promoted to Deputy Marshal, further success can eventually lead to the player being promoted to the level of U.S. Marshal.    The player's gun can hold up to 6 bullets at a time. On each stage, there are special items that can be shot to reveal better weaponry, such as double rigs, rifles, 50 caliber sharps, shotguns, gatling guns and cannon. The gatling guns and cannon can only be used once but the double rigs, rifles, 50 caliber sharps and shotguns can be reloaded the same way as your regular 6-gun. Once a life is lost, any additional weapons are lost and the player is once again armed with only a 6-gun.
