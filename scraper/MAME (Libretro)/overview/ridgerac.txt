Ridge Racer is a superb, single-person racing game from Namco, featuring texture-mapped polygon graphics; in which the player competes against computer cars or attempts to set a 'personal best' in a time trail event. Ridge Racer features just a single racing track, but different sections of the track become available to add variety to the racing.    Ridge Racer's superb gameplay places a large emphasis on 'power sliding'; locking the car in a slide and drifting through corners. Perfecting this skill is key to winning races.
