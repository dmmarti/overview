The object of the game is to help Dr. Mario destroy the most sickening bunch of viruses around. These miserable germs can only be destroyed by lining up the appropriate combinations of vitamins as they fall. And Dr. Mario is relying on your players to help him get the job done! This game isn't just fun. It's contagious. That's why players of all ages keep coming back to Dr. Mario for another dose.
