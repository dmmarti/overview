In the center of the screen is a sun. Any space ships or ship's fire coming in contact with the sun are destroyed. The sun exerts an increasing gravitational pull as play progresses.    A player controlled space ship is randomly located on the screen. The space ship's movement is controlled by rotate right, rotate left, and thrust buttons. For quick escapes, the space ship can be thrust into hyperspace, causing the ship to disappear and then reappear in a different location.    The space ship possesses two weapons. The first weapon consists of shots fired by pressing the fire button. These shots will destroy any alien ships they strike, but will disintegrate if they do not hit any targets. The second weapon is a nuke which is launched by pressing the nuke button. The nuke will continue to travel across the screen until either it strikes a target or the player detonates the nuke by pressing the nuke button a second time. The nuke will destroy all alien ships within a limited radius of the explosion.
