Dynamite Dux is a beat 'em up game, though rather than relying purely on one-on-one combat the ducks can equip themselves with a variety of weapons, from water pistols to bazookas. The game is also populated with a variety of odd looking enemies and bosses. Colonel Sanders, for instance, can be seen at the very beginning of the first level.
