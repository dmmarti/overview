In 1993, the first Art &amp; Magic's game has been compared with a tornado in the arcade's world. Based on a clever system of scrolling planes this game looked like a 3D game. The graphic's quality and the extremely good gameplay pushed "Ultimate Tennis" to the 2nd place in Germany and  to the 14th place in the Japanese charts and was successfully diffused all around the world: 5.000 boards have been sold worldwide and among them more than 500 boards in Japan!
