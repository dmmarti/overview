Mad Alien is kind of a combination of a shooter and a driving game. You drive a car equipped with a gun on a road. The landscape around you shows different settings (cities, country side, tunnels) and scrolls by from the top to the bottom of the screen. Your enemies (mad aliens) drive in front of you in a "Galaxian"-like formation and you have to shoot them. Watch out for mad aliens leaving the group and turning back to attack your car.
