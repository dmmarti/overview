A horizontal tank shooter game, with great atmosphere Parallax scrolling background.    The mid-day heat is rapidly becoming unbearable as the supply helicopter lowers your battle tank on to edge of the desert. You have a whole day's travelling ahead, 90 miles across the seemingly endless desert, until you reach the target of your mission - the enemy's desert fortress. Only after you have managed to destroy it, will it be safe for the transport helicopter to collect you and send you on another full-scale mission.    Unfortunately, the going across the desert is not easy. Your tank has run out of super-missiles and you must replenish your armoury from the stockpiles on the way. If you don't collect enough you will not be able to destroy the forts and the enemy base, which is so well protected you need three missile hits to put it out of action. However, you have unlimited supplies of shells for your heavy duty gun that can fire in all directions.
