The game level can be selected at the beginning of the game or after game select button has been pressed. Press the buttons from 1 to 10.    Bounce Back - Sets boundaries around perimeter of the TV monitor screen. Example: Starship immediately reverses direction after reaching boundary. Normally perimeter boundaries do not exist.  Negative Gravity - Sun radiates gravity outward to perimeter boundaries of the TV monitor screen. Normal sun state radiates positive gravity (positive gravity is inward toward the sun).  Zero Gravity - Sun does not radiate gravity.  Black Hole - Invisible sun with any selected gravity.  Space Stations - Two space stations orbit around sun. Each player is designated a specific space station on which he may land for repairs, fuel and shells. When player starship touches opponent's station it is immediate annihilation.
