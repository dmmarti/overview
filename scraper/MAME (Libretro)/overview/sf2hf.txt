Street Fighter II' - Hyper Fighting is the second SFII follow-up. Here's what's new:   Gameplay is SIGNIFICANTLY sped up to intensify the pace of the game.   More special moves (ie. Chun Li's fireball, Dhalsim's Yoga Teleport) are added for each character except for M. Bison.   New color schemes are added for each character (but the color schemes for the stage backgrounds are still the same as they were for Champion Edition).   The addition of mid-air special moves for Chun Li, Ryu and Ken are introduced.   Platform graphics (resembling the medal ceremonies in the Olympics) are added to each character's ending, featuring the character you completed the game with at the first-place platform, M. Bison at the second-place platform, and Sagat at the third-place platform. The musical setting for this display is the music from the home stage of the character standing on the 1st-place platform (If you completed the game with Sagat or M. Bison, the one you used stands on the 1st-place platform, the other one on the 2nd-place platform, and Vega occupies the 3rd-place platform).
