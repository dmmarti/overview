Mad Ball is a breakout game featuring photo-image backgrounds of bikini idols.  The game plays very much along the lines of "Arkanoid" with power-ups for both the ball and the paddle.  Each stage features a different girl for the background.    Blocks and enemies can be destroyed by both the ball and by shooting them with the gun on the paddle. Breaking blocks reveal various power-ups. Power-ups for your paddle fall to the bottom of the screen and can be caught by your paddle.  Power-ups for your ball float in the same location for a limited time and are activated when hit by the ball.    When enemies and blocks are destroyed coins and jewels fall to the bottom of the screen to be caught by the paddle for points. At the end of each stage these points may be used to buy power-ups for use in the next stage.    Every time the ball (or last ball in the case of multi-ball) falls past the paddle the player loses a life.  The game is over when the player loses all his lives.
