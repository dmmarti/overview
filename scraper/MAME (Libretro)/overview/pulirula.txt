PuLiRuLa is a six-level, sideways scrolling beat-em-up for 1 or 2 players that defies any logic in either its theme or its graphical approach; that places the players in a dream-like world populated by armies of strange and bizarre creatures.     PuLiRuLa's plot centres around the world of 'Radishland'. Each of Radishland's six towns is kept running smoothly with the aid of a giant key, which is necessary to keep the world's 'time-flow' moving. The key is stolen by a mysterious enemy and the timeflow is disrupted. Players must fight their way through waves of increasingly abstract enemies in their quest to recover the key and restore time to Radishland.
