Doki Doki Penguin Land is a platform puzzle game in which the player controls a penguin called Adelie and must safely guide an egg - by digging downwards - from the roof at the top of each stage down to the penguin's living room and waiting wife.    The penguin can push the egg left or right and can jump on it to make sure it doesn't get stuck against a wall. Digging affects the tile one block away from the penguin's position, making it impossible to dig directly downwards. If the egg gets into a position where it cannot be moved left or right, jumping and landing on it will cause it to smash.
