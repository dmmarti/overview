You have 60 seconds to get from the starting line to the finish line. Finishing within 60 seconds allows you to go on to the next race. If you lose, a continue option is available. The screen scrolls fast. The only way you know about a turn coming up is by a little indicator that flashes with a picture of the turn. There are zig-zags, hairpins and all other cool turns, most of which you have to steer into in order to make it though.
