Sega once again prove themselves to be kings of the racing genre with the superb and innovative "Virtua Racing". This was the first racing game to be fully rendered with shaded, filled polygon graphics (the first game to ever be rendered in filled polygons was Atari's incredible 1983 release, "I, Robot").    As well as the sublime graphics and superb playability, Virtua Racing also allowed players to switch camera views to suit their preferred style of play. The game features 3 well designed and varied courses; 'Big Forest', 'Bay Bridge' and 'Acropolis'.
