Naughty Mouse, also known as Woodpecker, is a platform arcade game where the player must take control of Naughty Mouse, who must make it from his own house at the bottom of the screen to his girlfriend's house at the top.     There are several differently colored woodpeckers that hatch from the large eggs positioned on the left and right sides of the screen, which set out to stop him. The player has a single button with which to make Naughty Mouse jump over them.    Some of the ladders may also become electrified after Naughty Mouse has climbed them, forbidding him to go back down them again on pain of death. Once he has reached his girlfriend's house, he will receive the stage's remaining time as bonus points and proceed to the next stage.    The main difference between Naughty Mouse and Woodpecker is the color palettes, and stage arrangements.
