The player must use an eight-way joystick to take control of the Lizard Wizard, whose mission is to help free the people who are caught within the planet Zyfus. The Lizard Wizard does this by shooting the rocks that fly out of that erupting volcano at the bottom of the screen which will burst into flames if he misses them and get eaten by the dragon-like lizards for their fire. As the prisoners emerge from the volcano, the Lizard Wizard must also rescue them from the planet by taking them to the platforms on the surface. The player must also face Spydors on certain levels, which must be killed before they reach the surface.
