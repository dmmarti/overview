The arcade version of Duck Hunt has many differences compared to the NES version.  It has more animations, a slightly different palette and zero game modes. Instead the game starts with the duck hunting game (with multiple ducks, just like Game B on the NES version), the second stage is the clay pigeon shooting game (the dog makes an appearance if you miss), a bonus stage follows where you can shoot lots of ducks for bonus points (as an even bigger bonus you can shoot the dog to make him appear with a cast and crutches and yell at you), then both levels and bonus repeat again followed by an intermission (called "Break Time") where the dog is chasing a duck.
