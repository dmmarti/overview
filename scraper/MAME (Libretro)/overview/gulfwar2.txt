A vertically scrolling shoot-em-up from Comad.    Gulf War-II is more like a bootleg or hack than an original game; a LOT of the game code is taken directly from Taito's "Twin Cobra". The gameplay is nearly identical but the theme and all the GFX have been changed.    Like many game from Korea, Comad used the Gulf war theme in the 90's. This was a great theme, because based on the actuality, and the game sold very well (hundred thousand of boards)
