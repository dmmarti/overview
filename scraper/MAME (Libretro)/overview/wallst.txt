Wall Street is a rather odd and unique game consisting of two stages.    Stage one consists of controlling two rescue workers who must prevent suicidal stock brokers from plummeting to their deaths and instead bounce them into a waiting ambulance.    Stage two entails controlling a broker who runs around town collecting money (which they must return to the yellow base) while being chased by tanks, which the player can shoot.
