This game is based on 'Ultraman', a famous Japanese live-action superhero series that has had numerous sequels and spin-offs since its debut in the 1960s. Generally, the main character is a normal human who uses an alien device to transform into a giant red-and-silver (sometimes with blue) creature called an Ultraman to combat alien monsters with the help of a special military team. Some of the subsequent shows in the series include 'Ultraseven', 'Ultraman Leo', 'Ultraman Taroh', and 'Ultraman Tiga'.
