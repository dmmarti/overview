Released in 1996, Pleasure Goal (Japanese title: Futsal) is Saurus' first and only football (Soccer) game for the Neo Geo. It features 16 teams which compete for the "Saurus Cup". Your team plays against all the others in your group, then it goes into an elimination tournament's semifinals and then the final to win the cup. It's worth mentioning that Pleasure Goal's rules barely base on Futsal, which is basically a 5-on-5 player indoor soccer style.
