An excellent sequel in 3-D.    You are the pilot of the mighty combat aircraft 'Solvalou' and must fly through vast zones full of enemies and armed with the classic weaponry the forward-firing gun for aerial targets, and the bombs to destroying ground-based targets and with the addition of a series of new and powerful weapons.     This game is a very popular sequel to the "Xevious" saga. It became quite popular because of a good 3-D modelling and nice camera work and featuring a nice BGM and sounds.
