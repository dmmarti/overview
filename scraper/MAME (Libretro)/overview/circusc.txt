Circus Charlie is a single-player abstract platform game in which the player must guide the eponymous Charlie through six different circus events. Bonus points can be won by finishing a level as quickly as possible, with further points awarded for collecting any of the money bags that occasionally appear.    Finally, additional bonus points are awarded for completing a level without losing a life. The game is over when all Circus Charlies are lost.    The six different events are:  Ride a lion and jump through fiery hoops and over blazing pots.   Jump over monkeys while walking a tightrope.   Bounce on trampolines, avoid fire breathers and sword jugglers.   Jump on giant, rolling beach balls.   Ride a horse while avoiding obstacles.   Trapeze.
