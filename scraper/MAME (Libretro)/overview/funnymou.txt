In this platform game, you are a mouse collecting a stash of food that happens to be scattered around the house. Opposing you are cats and cobras, which pop up out of nowhere. You're not exactly helpless, though. You have balloon bombs which you can lay and detonate, rocks on top of the house to drop, floors that move across when you step on them and pools of water under bridges which you open by walking over them. All these can kill of cats and cobras, if you use them right.
