Cruis'n World is a direct sequel to "Cruis'n USA", and is again a point-to-point racing game, with each race having the player racing against nine rival drivers.    Unlike its USA-set prequel, Cruis'n World's races take place in a variety of global locations, such as the Egypt, London and France. Players can race in any one of twelve countries ranked by difficulty, or drive the entire world through fourteen tracks.    While the core gameplay remains the same, new time-saving stunt moves have been introduced in the form of wheelies and jumps, and many tracks now feature short-cuts.
