Step into the world of of Gauntlet Dark Legacy and prepare for an adventure. Built on the strength of "Gauntlet Legends", Dark Legacy takes the action to a new dimension with new characters, new realms, new combos and improved graphics. Four new characters join forces with the original four Legends characters to explore and battle their way through eight realms of gameplay. The Mountain, Desert, Forest and Castle Realms have been updated to match the depth and complexity of the four new realms... Ice, Town, Sky and Dream. There is also a bonus Battlefield Realm. Multi-player gameplay has been enhanced by allowing two players to work together to activate special moves with new combos. In addition, Dark Legacy is full of secret codes and passwords that give special access to alternate characters and many other surprises (see 'Tips And Tricks' section for more information).
