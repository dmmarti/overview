Pandora's Palace is a platform game in which the player takes on the role of a Roman emperor and must make their way from the top left corner of the screen to the exit at the bottom right corner. This can only be achieved utilising the poles and moving platforms the form each stage.     Burning fires litter the platforms and these must either be avoided or jumped over. Constantly-spawning enemies also patrol each stage and while they won't kill the emperor directly on contact, they can push him into fires or over the edge of platforms, costing the player a life.    Each stage has a set number of flashing bunches of grapes hanging from platforms and buildings, picking these up temporarily sees the laurel leaves and gown the Roman Emperor is wearing replaced with a roman helmet and tunic. While is this mode the emperor can destroy enemies by jumping on their heads, earning bonus points.
