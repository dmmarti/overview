Sky Soldiers is a vertical scrolling Shoot em' Up developed by Alpha Denshi and released to arcades in 1988 by Romstar in North America and SNK for the rest of the world. The game features a time travel theme as well as an organized weapon select screen at the beginning of each stage.    Players travel back in time starting in Great Britain 1945, Germany 1915, Japan 1945, Germany 1944, Vietnam 1974, France 1914, Russia 1974 and finally the space station in the present time, 2110. Each time stage has two levels, both ending in a boss battle save for the final stage, resulting in a total of 15 Areas.    The ship's weapon system is accessed in the beginning of each stage. The shipâ€™s main shot consists of a semi-automatic Wave Shot. The shipâ€™s bomb weapons include forward firing missiles, fireballs, homing missiles and the buster bomb. The ship can be equipped with only one bomb weapon from either category at a time. The ship can only be loaded with a certain number of Bomb weapons and they can only be resupplied at the end of the level. The only pick-up item in the game is a parachuting human pilot shot down from malfunctioning fighter planes/jets; collecting these pilots results in random bonus points.
