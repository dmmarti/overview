The player take control of a girl named Alice who walks over scrolling platforms, through nine different isometric worlds and she must knocks enemies over the edge with her bubble blower, while collecting various powerups along the way. Holding the fire button down generates bigger bubbles. The enemies attack shooting marbles at her, that can make she fall over the edge unless they are avoided or jumped over.
