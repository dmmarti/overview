This title contains 5 different games, one of which is a platform game, with the remaining four being puzzle games. They are :
* "Tong Boy" combines elements from both "Donkey Kong" and "Donkey Kong Jr.".
* Bubble Gum (a clone of "Puzzle Bobble")
* Cross Point (a clone of "Columns")
* Box Logic (a clone of "Logic Pro")
* Rocktris, (a clone of "Tetris")
Both 'Cross Point' and 'Rocktris' feature adult content in the form of badly digitized pictures of naked women. Despite the colourful and nicely-rendered graphics of most of the games on offer, none manage to match the playability of the arcade originals on which they are based.
