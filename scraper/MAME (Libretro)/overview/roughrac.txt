Rough Racer is a colourful top-down racing game for one to four players; Rough Racer takes most of its inspiration from Atari's "Sprint" series, and from "Championship" and "Super Sprint" in particular.    The game features ten different tracks, each with its own graphical theme. After the first race, in addition to the four racing cars a fifth 'drone' vehicle is added, whose sole intention is to hinder the four racers. The drone is visibly different from the racers and can be anything from a steam roller to a cement mixer.
