The player controls a battleship which must move around the edge of an island trying to shoot the dot obstacles, mines and a central skull enemy to earn points and while avoiding the bullets fired at it by the indestructible gun turrets. If it should get hit by one, it will lose a life, but once it has cleared the island, the remaining time will be added to its score (in 100-point increments), and it will proceed to the next round.
