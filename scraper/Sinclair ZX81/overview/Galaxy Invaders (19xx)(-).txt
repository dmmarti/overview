Galaxy Invaders is a Space Invaders clone where you control a craft on the bottom of the screen moving left or right, blasting aliens above in formation. The aliens move across the screen slowly descending downwards. As you blast the aliens, you must avoid the bombs that they drop because if you hit one or allow an alien to land on the bottom of the screen you lose one of three lives. Between your craft and the aliens are five shields but parts disappear when hit by your bullets or the alien's bombs. Before the game you can choose the speed of the game (0-9) from easy to very hard.
