The player takes on the role of one of the few survivors, with the goal of destroying the Cybercon III computer.  The gameplay of Cybercon III revolves around exploration and puzzle-solving as the player works their way through complex where the computer is stored, with the player tasked with destroying or disabling the computer and its defenses and bypassing the computer's notice, made easier by way of a secret entrance into the complex.
