Tetris meets shoot-'em-up, Rampart is a game combining strategy and artillery action. Build your castle from Tetris-style pieces, place your cannons, bombard the enemy, try to repair, do it all over again. The original arcade release has a single-player and a two-player mode; later revisions incorporate three-player gameplay.
