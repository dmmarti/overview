Set in 1800, Champion of the Raj places you in command of one of five factions (British, French, Mogul Empire, Maruthras, Sikhs or Gurkhas) vying for control of India.  Territories under your control will generate taxes which can be put towards hiring troops, improving the military, industry or law and order. Hiring troops and improving their weaponry allows players to attack and capture other territories, while investing in industry or law and order can improve the economy and reduce discontent.  Players can also choose to use negotiation to bring new territories into their empire. The result of these negotiations often hinges on winning arcade sequences, an elephant race or a tiger hunt. Arcade sequences also follow major events such as capturing the palace of an enemy empire.
