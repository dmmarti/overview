Super spy Mata Hari (also known as an exotic/erotic dancer and courtesan) has just entered the embassy, where the double agent Wallos is prisoned under high surveillance. It is necessary that you help her because her mission is perilous. She will have to eliminate one after another all security guards (humans and robots) by shooting them from her pistol, avoid flying robo-droids by standing in doggy-style pose, and acquire the number of secret code for the electronic doors by threatening the embassy employees. Queen of explosive, she will have to collect the dynamites scattered within embassy and blow up the strong doors and safes, where diskettes (CPC) / keys (ST) are hidden, which allow to reach the upper floors by the elevator. Every wrong move of Mata Hari means her coma and every coma of Mata Hari throws her into embassy's hospital, from where she may exit optionally (in Amstrad CPC version) or fighting with a guard (in Atari ST version).
