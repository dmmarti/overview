Don't you hate it when your favorite TV show gets cancelled? Prime Time from First Row Software lets you be the moron who cancels all of the intelligent but low-rated TV shows in favor of popular pseudo-dramatic tripe and identical sitcoms. Take on the duties of a TV network executive in this highly unusual simulation game. Pick the shows you want to air, from 160 regular programs and 15 network specials. Plan a schedule, recruit advertisers, bump shows around optimal time slots, but whatever you do, keep the ratings high if you want to keep your job.
