In the game similar to Moon Blaster, you are a pilot of ground-skimming jet sent on the surface of some dark hostile planet to eliminate the enemies blasting them off. There are four kinds of enemies determined by brain and force in 4-points scale, and you may assign them before the start of your mission. Sitting in the cockpit in first-person view, you may speed up or turn your jet, collect different weapons such as lasers, missiles, powers, and blast the enemy tanks or environment off. You should examine the scanner to see the directions and distances of the threats, and watch the shield level until it reaches zero.
