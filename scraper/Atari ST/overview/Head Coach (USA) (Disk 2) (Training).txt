A microcomputer port of an old mainframe game, Head Coach simulates the NFL American football league from a dry manager's point of view, with a lot of text-heavy ANSI screens. Amiga/ST version 3 comes with player data for the 1991/1992 NFL season.  Each 40-minute match offers 26 offensive plays and 21 defensives. Use the strengths of individual players, based on continuously updated stats, to exploit the weaknesses of the opposing players. Running yards, passing yards, kick-off returns, punt returns and other statistics will reveal all there is to know about your team. As your players grow old, you can replace them using drafts from the college league.
