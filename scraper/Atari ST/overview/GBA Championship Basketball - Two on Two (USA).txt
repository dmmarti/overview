GBA Championship Basketball can be played as One or Two Player vs. the Computer or Two Player with Computer Teammates and includes Practice Play. Draft your Teammates from a list of ten players whose styles are patterned after real professional superstars. Practice with games like Around the world and Horse, or go one-on-one with a friend. You play GBA Basketball on a full court. And when it comes to shooting, you have a full range of choices, like hook shots, tip-ins, jumpshots and even dunks. After each game, you can read the sports page of the Gamestar Gazette to check box scores and division standings.
