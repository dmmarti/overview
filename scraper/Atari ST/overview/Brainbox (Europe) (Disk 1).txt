Brainbox is a quiz game, in which the player plays against the computer. A round is made of nine questions from the categories Books, Science, Sport, Leisure, Places, History, Pot Luck and Art. On getting a question, you have to answer within a time limit, and on a correct answer you get a green cross, else a red circle.  The display is on a 3x3 grid, and control is via keyboard only. The database contains more than 3,000 questions. Playing against other human players is not possible. On giving a wrong answer, you do not get the correct answer displayed.
