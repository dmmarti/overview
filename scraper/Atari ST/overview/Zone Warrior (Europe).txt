In the distant future of the 30th century, the Earth is under attack by evil aliens, known as the Geeks. Their attempts at conquest have thus far proven unsuccessful due to humanity's advanced technology. But that might soon change: the Geeks have captured experimental time travel technology aboard an Earth defence satellite. Their plan is to travel into the past, disrupting the development of human technology, making conquest easy in the future. Our last hope is a lone soldier sent after the aliens. He must save Earth's scientists and destroy the Geeks in different time zones.  Zone Warrior is a side-scrolling platform game with exploration and shooting elements. It consists of five levels: Prehistoric, Egyptian, Medieval, Japanese and Future zones. Various enemies stand in the way, fitting the respective time period: dinosaurs and cavemen in prehistoric times, pharaohs in Egypt, robots in the future. The player's blaster can be upgraded to three- and five-way shots by collecting power-ups. Also available are various bombs and mines and a flamethrower. Levels are large and consists of distinct sections interconnected by doors and gates. To help navigating them, parts of a level map can be found. To complete a level, a number of hostages must be rescued and the Geek Commander destroyed. The Commander is located behind a security door, and a key must be found to open it. Also in each level is an armoury with some especially powerful weapons useful in defeating the Commander.
