In this tank simulation game based on Harold Coyle's book of the same name, Team Yankee is a squad of crack tank drivers and gunners. They are in the latest tanks, such as the well known Abrams M1, Bradley M2, T-72 and T-62, armed with lasers, machine guns and SABOTs. As Commander Sean Bannon, you must use these resources correctly in five missions ranging from defending a hill to attacking a centre through a forest.  The control interface of the game is somewhat unique as it features a four-way split screen with different control options in order to grant direct orders to four individual platoons of tanks. The game simulates instruments of war including thermal imaging in a detailed manner, as well as giving access to scrolling maps of the battlefield as combat unfolds.
