Campaign covers some of the most important battles of the Second World War, from Sahara to the Russian campaign, and from the Battle of the Bulge to D-Day. A map editor allowing users to modify existing scenarios or to create new ones is included.  You can take involvement at many levels of a battle. You can take direct control of either driving or gunning a tank, direct groups of 16 tanks and their support units, and create a combined overall strategy factoring in supply routes. Over 150 different vehicles from both sides are featured.  It's a hard-core wargame that will like mostly to the aficionados of the genre. The game package includes a lot of extras: a thick Equipment factfinder manual (170 pages), 2 huge posters, replicas of WW2 postcards and of a newspaper.
