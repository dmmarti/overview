Humans and aliens are living in harmony in the future, until a tabloid journalist stirs up hatred towards aliens. They respond by invading the planet, and it's down to the protagonist to clear up a situation scarily similar to reality in this arcade conversion.  Gemini Wing is a vertically-scrolling shoot 'em up, which is distinguished by its unusual power-up system.

The organic backgrounds are detailed, and have many sections which fire at the player character.
