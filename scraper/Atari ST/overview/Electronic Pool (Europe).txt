Electronic Pool is a simplified cue sports game with only six billiard balls on the table. The game offers two different game modes. In 1-player mode your goal is to pocket the balls in as few shots as possible and try to get as high a score as possible. Missing too many shots means an early game over. In 2-player mode you try to get more points than your opponent to win the game.
