First computerised version of the novel written by Jules Verne, Journey to the Center of the Earth is a mix of action and adventure - an exploration game paved with many action-oriented mini-games. You play the role of a scientist who is on the way to prove that Arne Saknussem's scroll is true, i.e. he really discovered the center of the Earth. You'll have to find your way through the volcano Knessel, avoiding falling rocks and mammoths alike.
