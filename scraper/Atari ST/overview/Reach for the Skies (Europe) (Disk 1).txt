Reach for the Skies is a combat flight sim focused on WWII's famous Battle of Britain, splitting the battle into four stages and giving you the option to take part for either the Royal Air Force or the German Luftwaffe. As well as piloting a plane, you can also take on Controller duties, of planning which planes to deploy where on each day, trying to minimise losses. Eight planes are simulated, from Hurricanes and Spitfires to Ju88s and BF110s, each with their own cockpit displays and characteristics. When playing as the Germans, protecting the fragile and slow Ju88 bombers is crucial. There is a practice mode with indestructible planes, realism levels can be adjusted, and time can be accelerated while an enemy plane is not in sight.
