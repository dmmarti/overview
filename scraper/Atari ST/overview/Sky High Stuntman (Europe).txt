Steven Squealburgh is directing his next big action blockbuster and needs a stuntman to help him film four big action scenes. You have been chosen and must fly a helicopter, balloon, jet fighter and a bi-plane. Remember you only have a limited number of takes to get it right or you are fired.  Sky High Stuntman is a top-down vertically scrolling shoot-em-up. The joystick or keyboard is used to steer while flying the helicopter, bi-plane and jet fighter. The fire button or space bar fire your weapon. Flying the balloon you use the joystick or keyboard to move a sight and shoot the enemy. Moving the sight so far will move the balloon in that direction. Fire button or space bar will fire your weapon.
