This Bridge game has built-in tutorial mode which makes it easy for novice players to start enjoying the game right away. Omar Sharif himself will guide you through the rules, and the sample hands show you the best bid or play to make in a variety of situations.  For the more experienced player, you can dive right in and start playing on your own, but Omar is only a mouse click away should you need some advice at any point in the game.
