Treble Champions is a football management game. The player can manage a squad, train players, and try to gain the way to the top of the leagues and cups. There are four divisions of 20 teams each and 1,500 (fictional) players with individual attributes are included in the game and purchasable for the manager. Beside the squad skills and injuries, the finances have to be managed for further progress in the game.  All menus and handling are presented in text based menus, mouse control is not supported. The matches are presented in text messages and an overview statistic about possession and shots. During the game, no interaction or intervention is possible. Loading and saving options are present. There are three difficulty levels and the player can chose in which league he wants to start (starting in the premier league is possible).
