Jungle Boy is an arcade game heavily inspired by Taitos arcade Jungle King from 1982.  There are four levels with different tasks. In the first level you have to jump from liana to liana, which are swinging and you have to press the joystick button at time to jump. The second level is avoid getting eaten by crocodiles in a river by moving up and down. In the next level two levels animals and cannibals are coming for you and you have to stay alive by jumping over them.  The levels are scrolling horizontally from left to right. The levels are very short and playing through the game only takes some minutes.
