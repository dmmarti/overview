Livingstone, I Presume? is a video adventure technologically almost identical to Goody, however this game has a more complex map and an obligation to alternate among three weapons and a pole that the player has from the beginning of the game.  The name of the game indicates a tour around each of the searches of David Livingstone that carry out the journalist Henry Morton Stanley in Africa in the 19th century. There the resemblance to reality ends and turns into a platform game.
