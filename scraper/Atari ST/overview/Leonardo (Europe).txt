In this top-down puzzle oriented game you have to help Leonardo, a little thief, on his criminal trips. Use your joystick to lead Leonardo through 50 different levels including banks, museums, and warehouses. Pressing the fire button of your joystick you can push everything in your way, except walls. Pushed objects won't stop until colliding with other objects or the police officer and his ghost deputy whom are trying to stop your robberies. Every level has a time limit in which you must bring three equal items into one line to complete the level. Each level is larger than the screen, in the lower half of the screen you have a helpful radar for orientation. Running out of time or being caught by the police-men will cost you one of your five lives. If you are able to master the first ten levels you will receive a password, which you can use to start your next game directly on this level. You can unlock more passwords after mastering Level 20 and 30. From Level 30 to the final Level 50 you must master the game with your 5 lives, no more passwords will be given.
