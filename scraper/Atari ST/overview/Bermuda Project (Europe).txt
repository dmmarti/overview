Stranded on an island in the Bermuda Triangle after a plane crash, you find a land with different technologies and cultures to yours. You must find a way to survive, rescue the missing passengers, and figure out how to escape and go back to familiar civilization.  Entirely mouse-driven, this graphical adventure game features dozens of objects and characters you can interact with. Objects are examined, taken or used via a couple of mouse presses. Each character you meet will have their own reasons for wanting or not wanting to help, so be careful how you react to them.
