In Armour-Geddon, a power crazed entity is developing a devastating energy beam to wipe out all unprotected life on Earth. In a race against time you must choose and control up to six different vehicles, and use them to destroy enemy power lines and eventually the beam generator. And thus you save the Earth and all mankind.  Armour-Geddon is a blend of simulation and strategy, in which you get to play both the brass and the grunt. You designate your targets and choose which vehicle(s) you shall use to blow them up with.
