Harlequin grew up living in Chimerica - paradise for any inquisitive child with its vast acres of surprise. When he left it to find a more challenging and mature world, it gradually withered away, and its many inhabiting creatures turned nasty. Harlequin must return to neutralise them.  He does this by firing hearts of love at them, as contact with any of them is fatal. The gameplay is platform-based, with lots of vertical ascents to be made, and features lots of bonuses and hidden sections.
