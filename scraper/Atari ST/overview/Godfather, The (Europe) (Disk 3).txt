Following the movie series (and released in conjunction with The Godfather III)- work your way up the Corleone family ladder over the span of 50 years, and attempt to destroy the rival families.  A walk-n-shoot game; each of the five levels represents a decade from the 1940s to the 1980s. Shooting rivals increases your standing, while shooting innocent people lowers it.  Each level also provides the opportunity for shootouts, a reflex-testing mini-game that requires you to kill people who draw their guns as quickly as possible, while not killing those that don't draw their guns.
