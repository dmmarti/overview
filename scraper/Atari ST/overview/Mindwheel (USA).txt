This real time all-text game puts you in the role of a Mind Adventurer, asked to journey back through the minds of four deceased residents of your planet in search of the Wheel of Wisdom. The Wheel is the only thing that can restore your planet from the state of chaos it's now in.  The hardbound book that comes with the game includes the instructions and a novella-length introduction to the plot.
