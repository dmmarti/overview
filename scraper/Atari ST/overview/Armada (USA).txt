The game is another entry in a row of historic wargames by Dr. Peter Turcan. This time it is focusing on the battle of English fleet against Spanish Armada invaders, which took place near Plymouth on July 31st, 1588. You may either play as Lord Howard or Medina-Sidonia. It is also possible to play a two player game, or to take neither side (watching the computer playing both sides).  The battlefield is observed in 3D perspective, up to 30 orders are typed in certain pre-defined text format, which is combined with names of commanders, places and time of execution. You will get reports from your subordinates indicating whether or not your orders have been carried out completely besides watching the battlefield yourself.
