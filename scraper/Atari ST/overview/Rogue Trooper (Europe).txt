Rogue Trooper is a Genetic Infantryman (G.I.) of the future whose entire battalion was wiped out on their first mission in the Quartz Zone of Nu Earth. Rogue must navigate many platform levels and several first person style flying levels to get to the root of the treachery. He is assisted by three bio chips containing the personalities of three of his dead buddies; Gunnar, Helm and Bagman - unfortunately, Bagman's silicon is deteriorating. The plot is helped along with comic pages between levels. This game is based on the long-running 2000 AD comic character of the same name.
