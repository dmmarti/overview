Bolo is a Breakout clone with a twist. You have to destroy all the bricks on the screen using your paddle to go to the next level but, in Bolo, your paddle is not restricted to the bottom of the screen -- it can move all around the screen, giving a whole new dimension to the breakout concept.  The game includes two different sets of 50 levels each, randomly selected when you begin a new game. It also features 46 different types of bricks with different properties, bonuses and penalties. The main menu allows you to access Training mode, from which you can select to play any of the 100 available layouts.  Bolo's graphics are black and white only, but the game can be played either on a monochrome or color monitor. The graphics are however much sharper on a monochrome monitor. The animations are fast and smooth, and the paddle reacts quickly to the mouse movements.
