The ability to move into the future with Time Machines has meant man can monitor activity that may harm the human race and prevent it happening in the present year 2047. You have been summoned to the space-station Historisat for a top secret meeting with the Director himself. Once you have found the meeting place, you get told that one of the androids called Meks will replicate so quickly that all human life will be destroyed in the near future. Meks can't be killed by Humans, only by another Mek with an amulet fully charged. The problem is that the amulet is empty of its power and the only way to charge it is to take it to various historic figures from the past to touch it. You must travel in the time machine into the specific time periods, find the figures and return to the space-station and give the fully powered Mek it to kill the rebel Mek.  Time is an icon driven graphic adventure where the screen represents a console with a screen. On the screen you can see your character move around various locations from the side interacting with the environment and other characters. The console part of the screen has various icons that enable you to move your character, pick up/examine/drop/use objects and talk/give objects to other characters. The mouse is used to move an arrow to select your options.
