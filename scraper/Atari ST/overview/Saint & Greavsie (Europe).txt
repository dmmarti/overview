Saint and Greavsie is a sports trivia game where one to four players have to answer sport-related questions. Players start by throwing a ball across a series of stadiums. To the left of these stadiums is a green bar, and the higher the green bar, the greater the distance the ball will go. Depending on where the ball lands, the player has to answer three types of questions from one of four question packs. Home questions (worth one point) are generally related to modern football and are the easiest to answer. Away questions (worth two points) are generally related to football in the 1960s and '70s with teasers about 'golden oldies'. Finally, derby questions (worth three points) will test your knowledge of football trivia, and these questions are fun as well as factual. Players can choose to answer the question or pass onto the next player. If the player chooses to answer a question correctly, a penalty shootout is given which involves the player kicking a goal to score bonus points.  The winner of the game is declared after all players have completed 21 or 42 matches (when one league season is completed). The winner is the player who has the most points.
