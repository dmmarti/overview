In Outzone the player takes control over a support space ship which has to aid a safety unit which has to travel through the dangerous outzones. The 28 levels are basically a big escort mission: in order to to protect the steadily moving ship, the player has to destroy all opposition waiting ahead in the usual shooter way. However, there are also blocks in the way which need to be destroyed by ramming them into each other. When they are destroyed in the correct way, they reveal power ups like new weapons, weapon upgrades, life energy, or shields. In order to keep the ship from crashing into non-destroyable blocks, the player has to connect to the ship and change the direction it steers to. When connected, the players own ship can't shoot.
