World Soccer is a managerial soccer simulation in which the player is responsible for the financial and athletic success of a soccer team. The world soccer league is the home of the best teams of Europe and the player takes over a team from the 3rd division; the goal being to become the number one in the long run. The game is mostly menu based in which the player can visit the medical station, the transfer market (available athletes are searched by a scout), the bank for a loan and of course the lineup for the next match. Each athlete has a few statistics which should be taken into account. During the matches the player can't intervene besides substitutions in the half-time. The player can watch the highlights of the match; either with animations in the 16-bit versions or as text in the 8-bit version. Alternatively only the results can be shown.
