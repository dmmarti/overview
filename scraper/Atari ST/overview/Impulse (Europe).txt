Impulse is an action puzzle game in which you must use your laser to activate the cosmic detonator. In each screen you must first kill all the aliens before you can trigger the detonator. When firing your laser it will bounce against the walls until it hits something, a switch, an alien, the detonator or yourself (in which case you lose a life) speed is of the essence in this game so the player both have to aim good and fast. You can't aim your laser gun directly so instead you have to hit rotators that will absorb you laser until you press the fire button when they will release the beam in the direction they are currently pointing.
