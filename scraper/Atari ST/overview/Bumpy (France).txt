The first game in the Bumpy series is, just like its sequels, about a head that can bump a lot. You control whether the head shall bump left or right, and how far up it will bounce, in a similar fashion to Mappy. You have to move across a series of bouncy platforms and pick up all items on the screen. Once all items are collected, the exit will appear so that you can go on to the next screen.  While most platforms are perfectly harmless, some have additional qualities, such as being destructible, thereby granting access to other parts of the screen. Some platforms are on fire, which will turn out lethal unless you have picked up a water droplet in advance. Bumpy was remade for 16-bit platforms as Pop-Up, and then ported back once more to the Amstrad CPC.
