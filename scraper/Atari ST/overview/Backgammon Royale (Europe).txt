Backgammon Royale is a simple computerized version of the classic board game of chance and skill called Backgammon. Backgammon Royale lets the player choose between two styles of play (aggressive or defensive), and also select the game speed between three parameters (fast, medium or slow). The game has a save/load option that gives the player the opportunity to continue the game later.
