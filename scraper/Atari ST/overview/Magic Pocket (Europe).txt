In Magic Pockets, the player controls the cool Bitmap Kid who has deep pockets that can store virtually anything. Bitmap Kid's mission is to get back his toys that were stolen by some creatures.  The game is a side-scrolling shooter that plays out across four worlds inhabited by a variety of enemies. The player can cause more damage to these enemies by charging their shots before firing. The player's weapon also changes its shape and features according to the requirements of each world.  The Bitmap Kid has special athletic abilities. He can jump high by stepping on whirlwinds and can even destroy all the creatures he hits after falling down from a high place. In addition, he also can ride a bike, dive and even fly thanks to the special items he encounters on the way.
