Eoliae is a remote land where myth meets truth, and where winds shows only the power of gods moving armies from front to front, while diplomacy is still 'hanging' in the air full of crossing winds. The chaos was born as the Great master was murdered, and evil Sharkaan is threatening all of the Eoliae land. You must learn the power of the winds, gain the knowledge for trade and diplomacy, build windmills and strike your enemy where it hurts the most. Only try doing that and stay alive.
