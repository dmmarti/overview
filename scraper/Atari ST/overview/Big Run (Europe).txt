Take part in the gruelling Dakar rally, driving high speed through a variety of landscapes, from countryside to desert. Your car has 2 gears. You will have to beat the clock on each of the six stages, and run high enough up the racing order, to qualify for the next stage. When you use a continue, the time is reset but your position is not, making it relatively easy to complete a stage after coming close with one credit.
