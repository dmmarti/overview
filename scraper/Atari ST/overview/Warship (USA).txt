Tactical wargame of naval engagements in the WW2 Pacific theatre. There are four historical battles to choose from, plus a custom scenario builder to make 'what-if' scenarios. Both, IJN and USN forces, can be controlled by humans. The game-engine is much the same as the one used in SSI's Battle Cruiser, which wasn't released for IBM PCs.
