The Adventures of Quik and Silva is a platform game where you control a pair of small droids. You have to guide your heroes through the level by avoiding the miscellany of monsters who stand in your way. Power ups come in the form of 'P' symbols which give extra spreading power to your bullets. Extra lives and other goodies come from bouncing into the X platforms spread throughout the levels, but many of them are difficult to get at.
