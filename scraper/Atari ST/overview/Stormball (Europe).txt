Futuristic sports game roughly based on Pong. The idea is to hit the ball into the other half of the area (hopefully going over some point scoring blocks on the way) and hope that it bounces back off the far wall back into your hands (and so you can take another shot). That's of course while your opposition tries to catch the ball for themselves and score some points with it.  You have to pay to play someone and so you gamble your entry fee: Lose and you lose your money, win the match and you win more money. Eventually you have enough to challenge the sport's star players and win some big bucks!
