Tornado Ground Attack is a horizontally scrolling shoot 'em up where the player flies a Tornado and has to take out a large amount of enemy planes. The main objective for each mission however is to destroy a target by dropping plenty of bombs on it. In addition to the fighter planes there are other enemies like helicopters and tanks and the player also has to avoid hitting objects like buildings and trees. Too many hits or collisions and the plane will explode and the player will lose a life. Parachutists will sometimes jump from shot down enemy planes and by collecting these the player gains ammunition and (occasionally) a bonus life or energy. To get additional and more powerful weapons the player can collect fuel pods that are dropped from some enemies when shot.
