Chinese Karate is a one vs. one fighter. Like the title suggests, the fights are restricted to hand-to-hand combat as well as flying kicks. The game consists of a tournament with six fights in which the player, in the role of the combatant with the white robe, battles against an opponent dressed in red. The goal of each fight is to bring the opponent's health bar to zero before the own health runs out. If no fighter manages to KO the enemy after two rounds of 99 seconds, the guy with the most remaining health wins. Each fight takes place in another area with a new background image and progresses in difficulty. Between fights the player gets to engage in a bonus game in which items, e.g. flying balls or vases, have to be destroyed for bonus points.
