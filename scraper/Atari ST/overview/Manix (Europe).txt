Manix is a puzzle game with 128 levels. The player takes the role of Filbert, a bouncing ball, who has a problem: there is war. Each level consists of a garden (surrounded by water) which is divided into squares with different colours. Before the level starts, the correct colour combination is shown, then grenades fall out of the sky and mess everything up. Now the player needs to bring back the original colours by bouncing on the squares: every touch changes the colour. If the correct colour is shown, it does not change anymore - at least until another grenade falls on it. To hinder the process, there are enemies and hazardous squares which should not be touched. There are also power ups to collect, that may add extra time to the time limit, change a few tiles to the correct colour, or reverse the controls.
