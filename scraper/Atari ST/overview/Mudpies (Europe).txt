Mudpies is best described as a single screen, overhead, arcade shooter played for high scores. Similar in style to Robotron the player takes control of Arnold, a young boy who has disrupted a circus by throwing pies at the clowns. The clowns however are not happy and soon they begin throwing things back.  By controlling Arnold, the player must navigate around the play area avoiding angry clowns and hitting them with pies to collect points. Clowns will attack by throwing juggling clubs and if hit by a clown or club will be sent to the First Aid tend and loose a life. Three trips to First Aid and it's game over (extra visits awarded for each 10,000 points scored).  Arnold also has a food meter to keep an eye on which must be replenished to keep him moving. Picking up burgers, fries and shakes are just what he needs but overfeeding is just as bad as under feeding however and if the meter gets too low or high he will slow to half speed.  There are six main rooms in the game which can be left when the doors become open, some rooms are Random Challenge rooms and have no pies to pick up for ammunition. If you can get out without getting caught you are awarded big bonus points. Also, after every 20,000 points you can exit into the Mudslinging Round, here the clowns are stationary and do not attack but are still deadly if ran into.  The game has support for two players with play alternating between each life lost.
