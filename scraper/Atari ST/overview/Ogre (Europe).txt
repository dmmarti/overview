Ogre is a char-set war game for medium or high resolution. You command a force of infantry, armor, and howitzers pitted against a large cybernetic tank, the Ogre. Your mission is to destroy the Ogre, or at least render it immobile, before it reaches and destroys your command post. The game based on a MicroGame with the same name created by Steve Jackson in 1977.  The battlefield is represented by dots and stars marks craters. The units at your disposal are: howitzer (H), heavy tank (T), missile tank (M), GEV (G), infantry (1-9 depending on strength) and the command post (C). When you have placed all of your units the Ogre (represented by an O) shows up at the left of the screen. After the Ogre appears the real game starts and it consist of 5 phases:1: You may move your units. 2: Units within firing range of the Ogre may fire. 3: You may move your GEV:s. 4: The Ogre moves. 5: The Ogre fires at everything in range, disabled units will be replaced with their corresponding lower case letter and destroyed units will be removed from the game. These phases is repeated until you or the Ogre wins.
