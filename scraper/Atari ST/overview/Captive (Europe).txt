You awake in prison, without the memory of who you are, where you are and why you are imprisoned. In the corner of your cell you find a briefcase computer, which gives you the control over a unit of four droids. Now you must use these droids to find yourself, and free yourself. Captive has a sci-fi setting, but resembles more a fantasy RPGs with robots and droids. With the help of the droids you explore tech-dungeons and seek information, which leads to the next planet(s) on a path, the end of which is your cell.  The movement and fighting is similar to games like Eye of the Beholder, but you can buy droid parts in shops beside the usual weapons and items. The droids haven't levels like in normal role-playing games; you must buy upgrades for the different parts of the droids, which make them stronger and faster. You can also buy a variety of chips, which allow the droids to see in darkness, invert the gravity or simple to shield a little period of time.
