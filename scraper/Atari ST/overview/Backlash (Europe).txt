Game-play consists of arcade style fast and frantic reflex action from the first-person perspective, much akin to Atari's coin-op Battlezone and programmer Paul Woaks' earlier and very similar 8-bit game Encounter. The game takes place on a seemingly endless flat landscape, littered with obstacles in the form of some pseudo 3D spikes protruding from the ground. Armadas of hostile UFOs shoot fire balls at you from every direction. Your aiming reticle is in the centre of the display, and is surrounded by circular radar, which is formed by a series of small white dots, within this are numerous red dots which represent the UFO enemies. You are dealt an initial five lives, and you score points for each UFO destroyed. The game features environmental effects, such as day time turning to night, and vice versa.
