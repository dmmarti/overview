The mighty wizard Anthrax, in an attempt to usurp authority over the kingdom, has summoned a horrifying Demon. The Demon makes good on his chartered task by summoning a horde of monsters to lay waste to the kingdom at large. Fortuitously, a random stranger is strolling nearby the kingdom and realizes that only he can beat back the foul creatures.  After some encouragement from the king, the adventurer begins the game on horseback, jumping over obstacles, beating flying creatures, and collecting potions on the ground. Afterward, the hero must proceed on foot through side-scrolling platforming levels, destroying creatures with his blade as well as collecting potions and additional weapons he will find on his deadly quest.
