An evil army of enemy space soldiers has invaded a space station. The player, taking the role of the infamous fictional character Bob Morane, must recover the control of the base, locating and destroying all the enemies.  Bob Morane: Science Fiction 1 is a multi-directional scrolling shooter game.  The gameplay is similar to the game Prohibition. Like in Prohibition, the player must locate (along the spatial base) and shoot each enemy soldier in a limited amount of time, before that the enemy soldier shoots the player.  The bests scores will be archived in the High-Scores table.
