Soccer Manager Plus is a managerial soccer simulation. The player takes control over a team from the second division and is responsible for its financial and athletic success. In the original German version the game used real athlete and club names, but the athletes are randomly divided between the clubs.  In various menus, the player can set ticket prices, visit a training camp or take action on the transfer market. Before the match, the athletes are divided into the team. Here the player should note each athlethe's statistics (goal, defense, offense, mid field and energy) which determine his performance depending on where he is used. The last setting to take is toughness: the higher the setting, the higher the chances of success. The downside is a higher risk of injuries and cards.  The main part of the game is completely menu based, but the player may choose to watch match highlights, only the goals or directly the result. The match segments are shown in a side-scrolling perspective.
