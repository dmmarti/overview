Taking off from where MiG-29 Fulcrum left off, Simis created a new simulator based around the top-modern MiG-29M. The M model has been equipped with modernised avionics, a fly-by-wire system and stronger engines.  As opposed to its predecessor, Super Fulcrum takes place in one big scenario instead of single missions. Your task is to represent the Soviet Union in a UN force sent to South America to defend a small country that is being threatened by a bigger and stronger neighbour. The game is relatively open-ended, allowing you to fulfill your missions in the way you see fit instead of monitoring your every step. All missions and their results are handled in your pilot's log.
