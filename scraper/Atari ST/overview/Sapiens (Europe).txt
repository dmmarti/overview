Sapiens is an adventure/arcade game that brings you back 100,000 years ago for discovering the everyday life of the Homo Sapiens Neandertalensis. You play as a young hunter from the Light-Foot tribe, and as such you'll have to explore your territory, keep up friendly contacts with the other tribes, trade objects, make assegai heads and fight for your life. One key to survival is to know your environment: learning the location of the springs, the hunting territories full of rabbits, the gloomy plains where wolves are on the prowl and the other tribe's camps is paramount.
