You can become the Player-Manager of a third division football team in this innovative action-strategy hybrid. The game features over 1000 fictional individual players to buy and sell, each with 8 different physical and mental skills rated, and you can choose which position to play these in. Four tactical systems are provided, but you can design your own and put it to the test in various situations using a raytrace system. Training sessions are presented visually, allowing you to pinpoint the exact ability and potential of a player.  The playing side of the game uses the Kick Off game engine. After a few seasons your player's ability fades and you eventually have to retire form playing and concentrate on management. You can however save your team and import it into Kick Off 2
