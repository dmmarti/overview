Sherman M4 is a 3D tank simulator. It is set in World War II and includes 3 campaigns; Normandy, Ardennes and Desert. You have up to four M4s, two jeeps and artillery support to complete each mission. The Germans have four different kinds of tanks, bunkers etc. Objectives include destroying bridges, capturing towns, rescuing jeeps and destroying convoys. You can drive one tank at a time and give the others movement orders on a map. They will automatically attack enemies they encounter. The map is also used for moving jeeps and calling artillery strikes. Your tanks can be repaired, refueled and rearmed if you capture hangers in some missions. Before each mission you can alter several realism options as well as the enemy moral, experience and commander.
