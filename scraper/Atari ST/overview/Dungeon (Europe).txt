Dungeon is a Hack 'n slash role-playing game made in Talespin Adventure Creation System with graphics almost entirely from the Fantasy Graphic Disk by Deltronics.  When the game starts an old man, the great Shaa, tells you about the game and what to do to complete it. The aim of the game is to travel through the dungeon and at the end defeat the necromancer Malik Adbul Aziz so that you can recover the Great Orb of Thoth. Before you enter the dungeon you must select the type of character you would like to play. There are seven classes and the starting equipment depends on which class you choose: Warrior (sword), Fighter (dagger and shield), Cleric (cloth armour and one healing portion), Mage (cloth armour and two magic scrolls), Thief (dagger and 40 gold coins), Barbarian (Axe and 10 gold coins) and Superhero (nothing).  In the dungeon you will encounter enemies such as zombies, skeletons, bats, etc. When you have defeated an enemy a treasure chest appears which is yours to loot. Now and then you will encounter stairs in the dungeon. These stairs leads to villages where you can buy better equipment, have a drink in the tavern and deposit gold in the bank.  The amount of stuff you can carry is limited. You can carry one hand weapon, one range weapon, one set of range ammo, one armour type, one shield, three potions, three scrolls and up to 99 gold coins (extra gold can be deposited in the bank).  The game is totally mouse controlled.
