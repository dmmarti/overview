It's just 10 days away from the great bike drop bash happening at Sturgis South Dakota, and you're miles away!  Ride your Harley through the open countryside to get there in time. You must dodge fallen rocks, automobiles, outrun the police, and rescue a few wayward females with car troubles along the way.  During your adventure, you'll be required to upgrade your motorcycle, join cycling events in local towns, and talk to natives in the local stores.  Once you get to Sturgis, then the real fun begins!
