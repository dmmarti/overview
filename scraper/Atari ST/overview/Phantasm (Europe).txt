Some people have very interesting dreams, and you are one of those people. Your subconscious has created a moon infested with evil beings, and a Pegasus ground-skimmer with which to destroy them.  The chances are that you played Tau Ceti shortly before bedtime, as Phantasm has much in common with that game's action elements. Armed with lasers and homing missiles, you must take down the aliens before the shoot you.
