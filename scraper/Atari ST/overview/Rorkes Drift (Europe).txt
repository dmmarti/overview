This game recreates the battle in 1879 where a British outpost at Rorke's Drift manned by 137 men managed to repel an attack by force of over 4,000 Zulu warriors.  This is a real-time strategy game where the player can pause the game and issue orders during a command mode, after which the orders are carried out and the battle progresses. You can only play as the British and two scenarios are available - one where the Zulus will attack according to the historical Order of Battle and deployment, and the other where the Zulus vary their strategy of attack.  Individual troops are represented in the game as animated soldier miniatures, with the player being able to move individual soldiers, resolve individual hand-to-hand combat situations and order a variety of different firing positions for each soldier.
