Pursuit to Earth is a shoot-'em-up game in the tradition of single-screen shooters in which the player controls a space craft defending himself against waves of approaching enemy formations. Like in the arcade game Gyruss, the player moves along a circle around the centre of the screen, and moving left and right on the circular path. The playfield is three-dimensional, with the player's ship firing to the distance. Enemies are approaching from behind the player or from the depth of the screen, but contact with alien ships does not do any harm. The aliens are also firing bullets, which are instantly deadly to the player, bringing the ship back to the Hyperspace portal.  During the fight red pills are flying from the depth of the playfield, which should be collected to be traded for extra weapons. Those contain speed buffs, missiles, shields and satellites.
