Trinity is a text adventure game, its events beginning in the near future. The player character finds himself trapped in the London Kensington Gardens, as hordes of nannies mysteriously block the exit. To make matters worse, a Soviet nuclear missile is about to fall. The protagonist finds a strange door and steps through it. The bizarre location outside of space and time contains other doors, each leading to a site where a historical or a fictional nuclear explosion has taken place. The player has to interact with the environment and solve puzzles to change the course of history before traveling to the New Mexico desert on July 16, 1945, and affecting the events of the fateful Trinity Test.
