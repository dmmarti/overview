Twylyte is an arcade 3D shoot-em-up in the tradition of Space Harrier and Backlash. The player drives towards the horizon continuously at enormous speed. There are indestructible barriers which the invisible player ship must avoid contact with, as well as enemies shooting and firing missiles at the player. Beside moving left and right, the ship can also moved up and down, which adds further possibilities to evade the barriers, but also makes it difficult to shot at moving enemies at different height.  The key goal in the game is energy. You lose energy on getting hit, and if the energy falls to low, you even cannot shoot back. If it drops completely, the game is over. Gaining energy can be achieved by collecting green energy blocks and at special stages, in which energy blocks can be collected between barriers without moving enemies. The hint to the energy stones is the radar, on which dots indicate upcoming objects.  The graphics are drawn as polygons, although you can optionally switch to wireframe graphics. Only rare enemy objects are rotating, most static elements are just zooming perspectively, giving the impression of zooming sprites.
