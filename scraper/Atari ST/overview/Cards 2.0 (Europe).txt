A game named after an East-Asian city is invariably either a variation on the Shanghai or the Towers of Hanoi theme. Peking is a version of the aforementioned, for the Atari ST series.  The point is to identify pairs of tiles in a pyramid arrangement viewed from above, thereby removing them from the stack. Only tiles which are not covered by other tiles can be removed, which calls for care when choosing which tiles to remove in which order.  Version 2.0 of Peking is well-endowed with options, allowing you to save and load games, save screenshots, an undo function and a function to identify pairs when you are lost. Even more cheat-oriented is the option to remove tiles from the pile Additionally, two players can play at once, each player being given a set number of seconds to find a pair before relinquishing to mouse to the opponent. When the game is ended, the score for each player is calculated.  To vary things a bit, a number of tilesets are integrated in the game. Apart from the traditional mahjongg tiles, there is a set of flags, a traffic sign set and a set of pictogrammes. The game runs in both colour and black and white, in high and low resolutions.
