Nr. 1 Super Guy is a straightforward platform action game where you play as Hong Kong Phooey himself to help fight crime. In this game Baron Von Bankjob has escaped from jail and it is up to Hong Kong Phooey to find him. The game starts off with the trademark scene of Hong Kong Phooey jumping out of his file cabinet as seen on the animated TV show. From there on you must maneuver yourself through each of the levels full of obstacles like the Baron's thugs, collapsing platforms, conveyor belts, oil and acid patches. Hong Kong Phooey's health is displayed via the Hong Kong Phooey Book of Kung Fu meter located on the bottom left of the screen. Collect drinks to help replenish your health, unlock doors and activate switches to help advance further into the level to find Baron Von Bankjob and bring him to justice.
