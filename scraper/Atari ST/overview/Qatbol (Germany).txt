In Qatbol the player is in control over a one-screen level which represents a real-life wooden board. Just like a real board, the player can change its angle in all directions. The reason to do so is a little ball which is also on the board and its movement corresponds to the board movements. The player has to solve objectives which change from level to level, e.g. collecting things on the board or moving the ball into a hole. Of course there are also obstacles like teleports, holes or mazes.
