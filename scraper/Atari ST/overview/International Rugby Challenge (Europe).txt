The follow-up to Rugby: The World Cup. The game features more options than before, with an icon-driven menu system including different control choices and match lengths.  Controls are similar to the original game, but tackling is now harder and requires more precise player placement, and rucks and mauls are implemented. As before, the scrums involve joystick-waggling, and are crucial to advancing the ball. Conversions are taken from a separate 3D view.
