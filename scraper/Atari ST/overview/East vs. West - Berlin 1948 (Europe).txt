Shortly after the war, several countries want to control Berlin. An atomic bomb has been smuggled into the city by the Americans. You play an American spy, whose mission is to guard this bomb and not to let Stalin have it under any circumstances.  This is one of the early examples of a 3rd person perspective point and click adventure, the interface being slightly more complicated than the famous SCUMM system.
