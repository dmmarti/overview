Although Graham Taylor was the England international football manager at the time this game was released, the player starts a management career managing in Division 3 of the league, and have to work your way up, either by improving your squad (much as Taylor did in his successful spell with Watford, who he took from the 4th tier of English football to the top division and the FA Cup Final) or by doing well enough to earn a job elsewhere. Once you can finish in the top 5 of the league, you get a password to load the international management game, in a manner similar to many of Dinamic's games.  The standard features of football management games are included, such as player transfers, team selection and organising training. You have a team of scouts who can be sent out to investigate other clubs, giving ideas on potential signings and helping you plan for future matches. A full squad of young players who could potentially challenge for the first team are on offer as well. You can directly interact with your players, and also recieve newspaper reports assessing your team's performance. The matches are represented by fully-animated match footage, which is of a comparable visual standard to Krisalis' arcade football games.
