Trolls is a kind of maze game coded in 68000 assembler.  Little Billy is always fantasizing and day-dreaming. It has gone so far that he even has forgot his friends and family. To teach him a lesson a spirit has zapped him into a world of fantasy and danger. You have to guide Billy through 9 levels so that he may escape the fantasy world. Every level is filled with traps and trolls will chase you.  To avoid traps you have to keep an eye on the Trap meter on the right side of the screen, this will tell you if you are close to a trap (but not where it is). To see the traps you have to collect and use magic pebbles. The exit is located at the top of each maze. Since it's a fantasy world you have infinite lives.
