A role-playing adventure set in the future as seen by Victorian era science fiction writers. Players explore the far corners of the Earth (Atlantis, King Tut's tomb etc...) and travel between planets on ships made of martian liftwood (invented by none other than Thomas Edison). Based on GDW's pencil and paper roleplaying game. Similar in design to Paragon's MegaTraveller series.
