Outlands is a rather straightforward vertical shoot 'em up. It does not feature any elaborated background story. The basic statement in the manual just claims: Kill everything.  The game can be played with two players simultaneously. Several extra weapons can be gathered on shooting enemy ships: shields, extra lives, double fire which double your shooting power, weapons that fire to the side and many more.
