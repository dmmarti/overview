You must guide Ozymandias through the catacombs of Astaroth's domain. To aid you in your quest you can pick up nine different mind powers, which act as powerups. These powerups include levitation - allowing you to float, Pyrokinetics - ability to create fire with your mind, and shape shifting.  The game is in the platform style and you must jump and duck the various obstacles you encounter. The monsters you will meet include giant scorpions, beholders and fire elementals.  You will have to defeat Astaroth's 3 guardians of the soul along the way, firstly a sphinx, secondly a 3 headed hydra and finally a marlith demon. Once you have defeated the guardians you will have to face Astaroth herself in a battle of the minds using the powerups you have collected.
