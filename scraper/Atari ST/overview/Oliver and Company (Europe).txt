Oliver is a homeless cat that teams up with a gang of dogs and their poor but good owner in New York. You control Oliver through mouse and keyboard and you move around in various places such as the dog gang's home, New York streets and Jenny's mansion. You must score 1000 points to get to next levels. You score points by collecting hot dogs on the street and by catching flying dog biscuits.
