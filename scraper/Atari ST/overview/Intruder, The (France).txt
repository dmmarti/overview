Intruder is a side-scrolling shooter. The player controls a space ship, flies from left to right and shoots everything on the way; preferably without dying from collisions or enemy bullets. The standard gun shoots both forward and backwards and can be upgraded by collecting power ups on the way. The game uses a gravity system: the player always needs to counter steer st avoid crashing to the ground.  Regarding power ups, the player needs to look out for symbols which have negative effects and should be avoided. Points for the high score list are also handled through power ups and shooting enemies rewards no points. Collecting an extra gives an automatic boost in one direction.
