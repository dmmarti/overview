After the success of the original Space Crusade, Gremlin Graphics created 10 new levels. These had higher difficulty than the previous ones, and included new monsters and game features. This edition includes the original game and the new levels, making for 22 levels in total; a lower-priced pack with just the new levels was also released at the same time.
