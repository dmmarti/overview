Esprit is the predecessor of the Oxyd series of games from Dongleware, sharing the basic idea, control and many gameplay elements with those games. Control method and physical effects are heavily influenced by the earlier Bolo.  You control a ball in a world with physical rules, like acceleration and gravitation. On touching regular stones, they reveal a symbol. You have to open two stones with the same symbol in a row to lock them. When all stones are locked, the level is finished. Therefore the goal of the game is the same as in Memory. Save controlling the ball, which can only be done with the mouse, in a world with ice on the floor, bumpers catapulting the ball in a different direction or with gravity spots attracting the ball, is very crucial element of gameplay, too. There are many special purpose items to find, some notes are giving you hints, contain the level codes for later start in this level, allowing level skips and more.  Overall there are 100 levels which can be accessed with passwords.
