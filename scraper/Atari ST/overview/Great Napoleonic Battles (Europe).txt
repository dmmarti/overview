Great Napoleonic Battles is a turn-based hex wargame which not only allows players to play three epic battles from the Napoleonic Wars but also includes a construction kit to re-create any land-based battle of the Napoleonic period. It consists of four programs: a 'Battle' program to play scenarios; a 'Mapmaker' to customise or create new maps; a 'Menmaker to create or modify units and pieces used in the battles; and a 'Warmaker' to modify rules, objectives and conditions of combat.  The game comes with three ready-made scenarios - the battles of Marengo and Waterloo, where you play the French, and the battle of Quatre Bras where you play the British. Players can choose to play either side in a user-created scenario, or create two-player scenarios.
