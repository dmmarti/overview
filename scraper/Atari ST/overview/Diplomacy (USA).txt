This is another adaptation of the eponymous board game by Avalon Hill.  The game is set in Europe at the start of the 20th century and up to 7 players may control the competing Great Powers (Austria, England, France, Germany, Italy, Russia and Turkey). The object of the game is to seize control of more than a half of the provinces containing production centers (which deploy new units after the year ends). Each turn (two per year) consists of two phases: diplomacy (negotiating alliances) and orders (which are given to move armies and fleets).
