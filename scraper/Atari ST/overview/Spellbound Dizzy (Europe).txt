Spellbound Dizzy is a continuation of the adventures of the egg and his friends, this time containing over 100 screens with individual names. Dizzy has trapped himself in a strange world whilst experimenting with a spell book, and must find his way out. Gameplay is mostly similar to the previous games, combining puzzle-solving and object manipulation with arcade-style jumps and hazard-dodging. Lateral thinking is required to decipher the riddles found on scrolls. There are also extra arcade sections on a runaway mine-cart and for a spot of scuba-diving.
