Tonic Tile is a clone of the arcade game Arkanoid. You control a bat at the bottom of the screen and must hit a ball upwards to hit bricks at the top of the screen to make them all disappear to move onto the next level. If the ball goes past your bat then it's a life lost. To help you there are icons that fall downwards when certain bricks are hit. These can help you in your game and include shooting lasers, ball sticking to the bat and extending the bat. There are shapes floating around the screen and although they can't hurt you they can make the ball bounce in a new direction. One or two players can play and each player has a turn when the other player loses a life. There are 33 levels and the first 16 can be chosen to play.
