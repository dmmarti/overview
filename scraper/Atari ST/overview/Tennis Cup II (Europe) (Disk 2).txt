This tennis simulation recreates all the rules of the sport, from tie-breaks to break points. The action is viewed from behind one of the players, also featuring a split-screen option. You can play singles and doubles matches over 1,3 or 5 sets. There are 4 different types of court - grass, quick, hard and clay. You can play single matches, practice using a ball machine which fires a succession of shots at you, or play a season made up of major tournaments such as the Grand Slam events, the Masters and the ATP Cup. Player abilities can be adjusted to suit different styles of play.
