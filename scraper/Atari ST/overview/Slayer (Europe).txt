As the ruthless Slayer you have hordes of enemies to wipe out in this horizontally-scrolling shooter. The paths are narrow and treacherous in a similar way to Scramble, so shooting out the wall-mounted installations is important. There are plenty of bonus weapons and shields available however, and 5 lives in total. Each of the 3 levels ends with a boss to defeat.
