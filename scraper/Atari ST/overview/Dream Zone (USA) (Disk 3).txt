Dream Zone is a first-person adventure game. A mad scientist's elixir has turned the protagonist's dreams into reality; while in this dream state, he must fight to stay alive, leave that forsaken place, and return to the real world. The game is composed out of still screens, and the player can move between them by selecting four directions. The interaction is performed either by typing text commands or by selecting verbs bound to function keys. Among those verbs are traditional Look, Talk, as well as the more unorthodox commands such as Buy or Hit.
