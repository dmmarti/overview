President Elect: 1988 Edition is an updated version of the original President Elect adding the campaign data for the upcoming (at the time) 1988 election. The game is a comprehensive computer simulation of a presidential campaign from Labor Day to election night. The game can be played by 3 players each assuming the role of campaign manager/candidate. The game proceeds through 9 weekly turns where the player decides how and where to concentrate their campaign efforts. Weekly polls are provided to give the players an idea on how they are doing. On election night the returns come in on a minute to minute basis until a winner is determined. The election night may be simulated in real time (2-6 hours) or the votes may be counted in 15 seconds. President Elect has seven historical scenarios (from 1960 to 1988) or a virtually unlimited number of hypothetical or ahistorical scenarios.
