Extensor is a light cycle game played from a first person perspective. Taking place on the planet Spazm it sees the player competing in a futuristic sports tournament against a number of computer dromes. To win the game the player simply has to avoid crashing into walls or into his or his competitors' trails. In addition to the first person view that takes up most of the screen there is also a long range scan that shows an overview of the arena with the positions of all light cycles as well as a smaller top down view centred on the player.  Before starting a game it can be customized in various ways. This include the speed of it, whether the speed should be constant or player controlled and how many AI controlled bikes should compete. Up to six AI bikes can be included and it's also possible to change their strategy (offensive or defensive). The pattern of the arena can also be selected, from no walls to a large amount of smaller obstacles.
