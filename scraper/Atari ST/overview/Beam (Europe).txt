Beam is an action game in which the player has to link together energy stations. To do so he moves around the playfield and bumps into said stations. Then the last two get linked with a red energy beam which is deadly when touched. Each of the 27 levels is won when all stations are linked.  There are many obstacles which hinder the player's progress, e.g. magnets and high gravity zones which affect the craft's movement or moving balls which should not be touched. The game features to modes of control: direct or rotational (similar to Asteroids).
