Based on the children's cartoon show of the same name, you play Captain Planet, the ecologically sound superhero. Along with the help of the five Planeteers (who have their own ecological special powers: Fire, Water, Wind, Earth and Heart) it's your job to clean up the polluted planet.  In this Turrican style platformer you play one of the Planeteers in the first five levels and in the final level you play as Captain Planet himself. Missions include saving the seals and fixing the ozone layer.
