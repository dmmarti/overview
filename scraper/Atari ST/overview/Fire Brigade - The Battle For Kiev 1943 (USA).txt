The Fire Brigade was the 48th Panzer Korps, which was heavily involved in the battle this wargame recreates - Operation Barbarossa, Germany's attempted offensive in Russia during World War 2. The game recreates the situations at 3 dates in the attack, and you can play any of those from either side.  You have a range of units under your command, as although the battle was largely tank-based there were also infantry and air units involved. Units can be told which positions to take up, and whether to defend a spot or consciously aim to attack it. The game's AI incorporates the significance of bridges, rivers and forests as strategic points, and your units can be subject to fatigue.
