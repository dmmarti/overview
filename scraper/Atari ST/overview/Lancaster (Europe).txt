This is a flight simulator where you get to play the gunner of a Lancaster bomber in WW2. The bombing runs are split into two different game segments. During the first cockpit-view section, you approach the site to be bombed and have to shoot down enemy forces in order to stay alive, by controlling the crosshair using the mouse and firing on incoming planes and bombs. Then, while flying over the target area in a top-down view, you have to direct the plane using the mouse, and drop your limited number of bombs on specific targets.
