Under Pressure is 2D side scrolling arcade game. The player controls a robot (he is trapped inside) and tries to rescue kidnapped gal. Gameplay is simplistic - he goes into right side, avoid obstacles like lasers barriers, and kill alien creatures. Sometimes he needs to hurry - for example, when the floor collapses. Killed enemies drop shells, the player can collect them for new weapons.  Game uses big animated sprites, for this reason, the player sees only the immediate environment.
