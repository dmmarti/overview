Dogfight is, as the name suggests, a dogfighting game for one or two players. Player one starts on the left side of the screen and player two on the right side. Try to shot down the opponent, avoid getting hit and avoid the large airship who floats around in the airspace. If you fly too high you will lose control of the airplane and it will crash. Sometimes a truck driving at the bottom of the screen will fire a surface-to-air missile making the situation a bit harder to manage.
