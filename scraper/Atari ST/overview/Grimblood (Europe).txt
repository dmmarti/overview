Grimblood is a murder mystery game that takes place in a medieval castle that is populated by ritual performing psychotic people. The only sane person in the castle is the player character, Earl Maximus, and only he can unmask the murderer that stalks the halls of the castle.  When starting out the player is shown an overview of the castle and by clicking on its windows it's possible to travel to a specific room. After travelling to a location the exploration screen opens which shows a first person view of the location. From here it's possible to explore the castle freely while observing its inhabitants. While exploring, the game runs in real time and new murders are likely to occur during this time if the perpetrator isn't caught. Talking to people is done through the interrogation screen and when it is open the game time pauses. It shows portraits of all the people in the current room and clicking on any of them starts a conversation. The conversation is controlled with the function keys and these can be used to ask questions, make accusations and give orders.  To win the game the player has to accuse the right person of being the murderer and this has to be done with at least one witness nearby. The murderer will then confess but if there is no witness he will kill the player too and escape. However if the player accuses too many innocents the people will be fed up and might throw him out of the castle.
