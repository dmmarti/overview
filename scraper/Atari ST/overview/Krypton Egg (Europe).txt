Krypton Egg is a Breakout clone. Like in all such games, your goal on each level is to break all the bricks with a ball, which you bounce with a paddle, and try to save it from falling out of the level. Some bricks have a random power-up within them. There are many various power-ups (most beneficial, some of them harmful), such as: lengthening/shortening our paddle, enlarging or duplicating our ball, adding thrusters to the paddle so that it can fly, adding various weapons so that the paddle can shoot and destroy bricks, and many more. Occasionally, various monsters will appear on the playfield and begin flying around. Most of those are harmless and do nothing except interfering with the ball (if it hits them, it bounces off). However, some monsters will destroy your paddle if they touch it. Each few levels, there comes a special action sequence where you try to defend yourself from a horde of incoming monsters, or defeat a boss by shooting it and avoiding its missiles.
