Enchanted Land is set in the peaceful land of Damiran. But as it is in video games, an evil wizard stops by and takes over. In this case, he broke the heart of wisdom and the only way to bring the story to a good end is to collect the pieces from the five levels of this game. The protagonist is the magician Kurgan who jumps through the multi-directional scrolling platform levels. A big boss stands at the end of each level, but defeating him is not enough to get access to the next: the hidden parts of the heart need to be found first. Besides platforming, there are are lot of enemies to fight. To do so, the magician has twelve weapons at his disposal which need a certain amount of energy to use. Just like the other two bars (jumping and life energy) it can be refilled by collecting crystals.
