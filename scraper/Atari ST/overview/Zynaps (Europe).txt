This horizontally-scrolling shoot 'em up features 16 levels and 450 screens of Nemesis-inspired action. You pilot a spacecraft through the levels, shooting as many of the encroaching meanies and mounted turrets as possible. Power-up tokens are offered for shooting some, which can be used to obtain better weapons including ground-attack lasers, speed ups and multiple bullets. Extra lives are on offer as well, which you'll certainly need, especially as you have to go back a long way when losing a life.
