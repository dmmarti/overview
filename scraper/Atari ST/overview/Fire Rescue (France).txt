In Fire! the player mans an advanced helicopter and tries to solve some of humanity's problems by shooting at them. The game consists of five thematically unrelated levels which consist of two stages each, e.g. in one mission the player has to destroy drug plants in South America and another one requires to deal with terrorists at sea. Regarding gameplay, this is a traditional, horizontally scrolling shooter: the player moves from left to right while shooting everything which moves. Shields and fuel are limited and if one reaches zero, the one and only life is lost. However, they can be refilled with power ups which are left behind from killed enemies. The standard gun can be either aimed straight or slightly downwards, but by picking up the correct power ups the weapon system can be upgraded.
