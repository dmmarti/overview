Bob Winner is searching for a lost civilisation somewhere in the desert, and has to gain three keys to access it by beating a boss in Paris, London, and New York respectively. The first two bosses are boxers, the last one is a gun-toting cowboy. The items necessary to beat the bosses are found on the preceding screens.  Bob Winner is a side-view flip-screen action game with hand-to-hand combat sequences. The protagonist will often have to avoid rolling barrels and flying insects that try to impede his progress.
