After Zubaran, the Lord of Ishar, has defeated the evil Shandar, peace has returned to the land. Unfortunately, it didn't last for long, since Shandar found a way to retain his spirit, which is looking for a body to possess. Using time manipulation, Shandar is trying to find the dragon of Sith, last survivor of the Great Black Dragons, in order to control his body and execute its immense power for evil purposes. Zubaran has to find companions, use the Portals of Time, explore the land, and get to the Black Dragon before Shandar does.  In the third installment of Ishar series the player can control Zubaran or import characters both from Ishar or Ishar 2. The gameplay is very similar to that of the second game. The player recruits companions and navigates the party through 3D environments viewed from first-person perspective. Combat is real-time, like in the two predecessors. A slight graphical change is the usage of digitized photos as character portraits.
