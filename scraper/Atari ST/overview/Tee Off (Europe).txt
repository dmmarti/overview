Tee Off! is an overhead-view golf game using mouse control. There are four courses on offer - Sunnymede, Runcorn, Petersfield and Overbridge. Beginner, amateur and pro modes are offered, affecting the distances to the pin. Shot placement involves a 3-click routine to set pace and spin, with a full range of clubs (but no on-screen reminder of their maximum distance). Holes incorporate bunkers, trees and sand-traps, although trees are not considered to be Out of Bounds - on occasion you can end up having to play shots from atop a tree.
