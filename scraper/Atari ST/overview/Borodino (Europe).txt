The sequel to the 1989 game Waterloo takes us back to the village of Borodino on the 7th of September, 1812, during the bloodiest battle of Napoleon's invasion of Russia.  As in the previous game, the player is observing the battle area through a 3D perspective while issuing commands by typing in certain pre-defined text commands that are combined with the names of commanders, places, and the time of execution. Players receive reports from their officers indicating whether or not the orders have been carried out to the letter.
