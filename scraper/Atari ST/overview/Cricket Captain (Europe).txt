Cricket Captains have a much greater role than their equivalents in most sports. Most major tactical decisions during the match ultimately come under their control, as they do in this simulation, in which you can play or merely watch the match action. Teams are real but the player names are fictitious.  Your options are quite similar to those of a soccer manager. You must hire a coach, scout and physio to enable you to train your players and keep them fit, and to acquire new ones through the soccer-style transfer market. You must select your team of 11 players before the match, with talented all-rounders more common than in real-life. The game takes in the four main tournaments of the time - a single-division league of four-day unlimited-overs matches, the Sunday League of one-day games, and two cup competitions.  The match view features a plan view of the fielding setup, and a forced-perspective view of the batsman as a shot is lined up. You must time and place your shot correctly in order to score off it. When fielding you can choose the bowler and alter the field setup.
