Dreadnoughts is a turn-based surface fleet battle simulator. It accurately recreates the looks, specifications and tactics of fleets of major naval engagements in the 'Great War' of 1914 to 1918.  The game starts by promoting the player to Admiral, placing them on the bridge of a great flagship, and then resets the clock to start from the critical hour. The game offers isometric battlefield engine used in Waterloo, including weather effects and fog of war system. Game calculations are based on complex mathematics. There are seven historical scenarios included (battle of Jutland which involves over 60 ships) along with other smaller battles and scenarios. There is also a practice scenario for the beginner.  Dreadnoughts is mainly played through menus where you have to point with your mouse or keyboard and issue the relative order. Commands are issued through sentences. There are several key words to issue orders, plus a directive so the computer knows who you're talking to.
