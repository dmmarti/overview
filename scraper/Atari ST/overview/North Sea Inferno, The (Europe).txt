Inferno is a Boulder Dash clone written in STOS in which you have to guide a demon back to hell. In each of the games five levels you have to collect all the diamonds to continue to the next level. On your quest you have to watch out for boulders that will crush you, eggs that hatch into monsters that will block your way and skulls that will kill you on contact. You may start the game on anyone of the five levels. In each level you will see many brown safes and if you have a key you may open them and retrieve the diamond they are hiding.  The game comes with a level editor that allows the player to create his/her own levels.
