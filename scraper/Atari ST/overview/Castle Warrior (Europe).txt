In Castle Warrior the evil magician Zandor poisoned the good king. Now the the player in the role of the prince has to defeat Zandor to get an antidote. The perspective is directly behind the prince's shoulder and the direction is always forward. The content of the six levels vary, but the basic movements are mostly the same: moving left and right, jumping and swinging the sword. Usually the player has to dodge appearing obstacles or fighting a boss enemy, e.g. in one level a dragon has to be defeated or the prince sits in a canoe.
