Kelly X is a space shoot 'em up played from a first person perspective. The player is a pilot working for the Peace Foundation (a future version of Greenpeace) whose task it is to search space for rogue nuke stations that illegally dump nuclear waste. The objective is simple: destroy the radioactive canisters and the stations as well as the guardian fighters that protect them. The player controls his space craft in a 3D space with the use of either mouse or joystick. The craft moves forward automatically but the speed can be increased and decreased. Moving left and right causes it to rotate while moving up and down causes it to climb or dive. To take down enemies and waste dumps a simple laser gun is fired. Colliding with or getting shot by enemies lead to the craft's shield depleting and when it's all gone it's game over. A hyperspace function can be used to move to a random location but then the shield will decrease.
