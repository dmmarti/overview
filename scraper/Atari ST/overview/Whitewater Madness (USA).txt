The first game to be made specifically for the new Atari STE machine may seem inspired by Atari Games's Toobin', but is a lot more violent. Floating a small boat down a river, you find yourself attacked from all directions by aliens, dinosaurs, mines and everything else that can explode or fire projectiles. To fend for yourself, your craft is armed with a gun, and pods floating around in the river will also make your life easier. Pure reflex work is not enough to survive, as the current of the river will always pull you down the screen and slow down any movement. This, and the forced scrolling the game uses, may lead to situations where you are squashed between a rock and the top border of the screen â€“ unlike most scrolling games, Whitewater Madness scrolls downstream instead of upwards.
