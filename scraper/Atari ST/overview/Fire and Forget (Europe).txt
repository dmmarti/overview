Restore peace on earth and collect a high score while doing so in the first one of the Fire and Forget games by Titus. Fire and Forget is a racing game in which you have to complete courses by blowing up various enemies and avoiding obstacles on the road.  The different tracks are located all over the globe. There are six courses within each level of difficulty. You have an infinite amount of lives, but when your car runs out of fuel it's game over. So be sure to pick up those power-ups.
