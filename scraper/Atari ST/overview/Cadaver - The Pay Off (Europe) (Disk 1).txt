Cadaver: The Payoff is an add-on for Cadaver and requires the original disc from that game to play. It continues the story and offers four more isometric levels of fiendish puzzles. There are additional spells and potions as well as additional evil baddies to defeat. The in-game maps have also been completely redesigned.
