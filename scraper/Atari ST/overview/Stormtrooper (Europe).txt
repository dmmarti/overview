In Stormtrooper, the player takes the role of a soldier who has to kill a mad scientist. This is a traditional, horizontally scrolling action game in which the player controls the protagonist while shooting at everything which gets in his way. In addition to shooting enemies, there are also ladders to climb, gate controls to destroy and sometimes platforms to jump. At the bottom of the screen there is a radar which tells when a fast droid is on its way which has to be jumped over.
