Alice was sitting at the river bank with her sister and got drowsy. Suddenly, she sees a white rabbit who was hurrying somewhere, muttering something to himself. Curious, Alice follows the rabbit into a hole that leads into a bizarre world populated by strange and exotic creatures. Alice has to use her wits in order to understand Wonderland's twisted laws of logic, and figure out a way to return home.  Wonderland is a text adventure with graphics, based on Lewis Carroll's classic novel Alice in Wonderland. The game follows the book's general story, while adding many descriptions, locations and puzzles of its own. The interaction with the environment is done mostly by typing; however, commands may also appear in pop-up menus and can be selected by the player. Sometimes puzzles need to be solved in order to be able to advance. The game features windows with adjustable size, separating graphical display from inventory, command interface, text descriptions, and other options.
