Bounce Out is a Pac-Man clone with an isometric perspective. At the beginning of the game you have three lives and three bombs (the amount of bombs is restored at the beginning of each new level) and to advance to the next level you have to collect all the red dots. Special bonus dots give you increased speed for a short time. Monsters such as ghosts, candles and light bulbs moves around the levels and you have to avoid them, placing a bomb in an enemy's path blows him up. A map in the lower right part of the screen shows you where you are and where the monsters are.
