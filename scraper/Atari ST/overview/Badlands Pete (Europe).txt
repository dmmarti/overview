The gouvernor's daughters were kidnapped and he hires the desperado Badlands Pete to get them back. The player takes the role of Pete, walks through the side-scrolling levels and shoots everything that moves. This is to be taken literally because the enemies are not restricted to the usual bandits; there are also other people like old ladies which try to land a hit. To be fair, these are mostly encountered when Pete uncalled enters their houses by using the so-called Strip-A-Motion feature. This basically means that Pete can walk inside the screen to enter houses or walk behind obstacles.  To shoot the enemies, Pete needs to draw his gun, aim and shoot - for the player these are three different actions. He can't walk when the gun is drawn so it needs to be holstered, too. The amount of bullets (replenishment can be found in houses or at dead enemies) and health is limited. The latter is represented by a heart full of red liquid which drains when Pete is hit by bullets or touches enemies.
