Spacola is a 2D space shooter. Like in Asteroids, the player's ship is pinned at the center of the screen, adding thrust scrolls the screen in one direction, and stopping must be done with thrust in the opposite direction. You can find some weapon upgrades like a twin shoot, you can shoot asteroids, and after destroying pirate vessels their pilots are crying for help and can be collected for points (the police is paying for them). The galaxy consists of 64 sectors and the beginning sector is always a different one.  Your job as pilot of a space craft is to deliver different goods to a space station. But there are some problems: a lot of pirates are hanging around in the sectors, looking to steal the goods. And even worse: you do not know exactly which space station you are looking for and most of the stations are property of the pirates as well. As with the bad situation, from the outside these pirate owned stations are looking exactly the same as the civil stations. What sounds like a design flaw was part of the monetization of the game: the disk with the game was not only without copy protection, but it was allowed to copy it freely and therefore the possibility to spread it through Public Domain libraries. The star map, which lists the coordinates of the space stations to deliver the goods, was a book with 176 pages, and this book could be bought from Dongleware.
