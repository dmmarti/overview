Dominoes is tile laying game for low or high resolutions. Despite the name this game has nothing to do with the original domino game, instead being based on the same concept as KaleidoKubes. The aim of the game is to cover the board with coloured tiles, the colour of each tile must match all of its neighbours (including the sides of the game area). Possible moves will be displayed at all times. The game area consists of a 5x5 square without the center square.
