The titular hero travels through this platform action game, slashing up mutant creatures with a sword and battling the evil Thanatos in hopes to save the life of Princess Lucanna.  The controls are fairly simple and include jumping, walking or attacking. Collect icons that will help in the enhancement of your armor, gain an extra life and coins to spend in the shop for new weapons. Be sure not to collect any skull icons or else it will call Thanatos' Ethereal Presence where you will have to use Rune Bombs to destroy it. After you complete one of the three worlds, you will be given a password so you can resume later after running out of lives.
