Create a party of eight characters from the usual DandD classes, and lead these characters on their quest for adventure.  The initial character development is fairly comprehensive, but the user interface for the game itself is a 2D top-down perspective with symbolic representations of everything. The game map is a simple grid with icons in various squares to denote the location of your characters, monsters, trees, etc. Combat takes place on a zoomed-in map of the same variety, and is turn-based.
