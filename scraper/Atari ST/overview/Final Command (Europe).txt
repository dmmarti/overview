Scientists managed to engineer a teleportation device which is manufactured on the planet Ipsos III. Unfortunately a mysterious explosion destroyed the factory and contact to the investigating space ship was aborted. Now the player takes the role of the special agent YG 30 with the mission to find out what happened and to retrieve the database of the teleportation device.  Final Command is a graphic adventure in a science-fiction setting. The player explores the environment in a first-person perspective, collects items and solves puzzles. The controls are completely mouse based: when it meets an interactive item, its form changes. After clicking once, a selection of commands appears which are also chosen with a click. Up to three save games can be saved on the game disk. The story is told in animated sequences.
