The sequel to Nicky Boom; this time Nicky must find out who has been removing ladders and blocking off caves in his homeland. The gameplay is essentially platform, with multi-directional maze-like levels. Beating the obstructions requires occasional brainwork â€“ hidden ladders are easy enough to uncover, and there are lots of hidden sections to look for. The levels are colourful, and the game has a cute look making it appear suited to younger players. Mirrors are placed around the levels, which transport you to a random place.
