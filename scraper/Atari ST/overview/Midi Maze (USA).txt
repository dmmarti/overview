Midi-Maze, played on Atari STs linked up via MIDI cables, is among the first multiplayer first-person shooter for home micros, and a descendant of the original Maze War from the 1970s.  The game is set in a maze with 90Â° corners, and all graphics are drawn with filled polygons. Weapon systems are limited to a plain gun with a small reloading interval. All the participants are represented by big, floating smiling faces. Up to sixteen players may compete simultaneously, but those who wish to train before a match can do it alone against drones. It is possible both to play one against all or to team up.
