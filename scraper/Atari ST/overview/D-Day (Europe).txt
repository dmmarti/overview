This multi-genre game represents famous historical events of World War II called D-Day and related to operation Overlord, when Allies attack Axis massively in France.  The game proposes to be a general in command of Allies group and optionally perform certain actions by yourself also. Such actions include:Piloting a plane over French territory to bomb strategically important places; Landing on hostile territory as paratrooper; Breaking through enemy lines as infantry soldier; Driving a tank and fighting as a tank team with enemies in French village. All kinds of gameplay differ in looks from 1st or 3rd person perspective in simulator-like missions (tank and plane respectively) to isometric (infantry) and platform (paratrooper) with corresponding actions made in all of them. All such military actions may be played as single missions or combined and also strategically managed on the map during a real-time approach in Overlord campaign. The game progress may be saved to be restored later.  Multiple options allow to turn off participation in certain or all military actions as well as adjust enemy actions including even such event as 'Hitler does not wake up'.
