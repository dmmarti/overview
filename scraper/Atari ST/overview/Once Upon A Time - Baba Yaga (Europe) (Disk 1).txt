Baba Yaga is an interactive book for kids that alternates between two main views: A first-person view with a point-and-click mouse interface, where the player has to click on spots on the screen to find objects and fight monsters, and a third-person view with keyboard controls for arcade sequences in the forest, where the player jumps, crouches and fight monsters in his way out. The plot revolves around a magical glove that was stolen by the witch Baba Yaga.
