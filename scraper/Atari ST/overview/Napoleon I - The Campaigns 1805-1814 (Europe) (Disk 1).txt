Napoleon I allows the player to relive Bonaparte's campaigns both on operational and (optionally) tactical scale, either from the side of France or Coalition forces. Four historical campaigns are available: 1805, 1806, 1809 and 1813. Apart from resolving the battles automatically or manually (on a small scale map), a third option was offered for tabletop wargamers - to use their miniature sets.
