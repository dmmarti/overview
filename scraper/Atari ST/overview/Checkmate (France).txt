Checkmate is a chess program with basic features: it does not only allow a game against the computer, but also player vs. player and computer vs. computer.  The board itself is drawn in 2D, the window on the left is showing the moves in the game in standard chess notation, while on the right a windows is displaying the computers analysis and progress.  Games can be replayed and saved. Some analysis functions help the player. An option allows to create a board position from scratch and play from that position. A small opening library is delivered with the program and can be modified.  The difficulty can be adjusted, basically by the time per move (10 seconds up to 10 minutes per move).
