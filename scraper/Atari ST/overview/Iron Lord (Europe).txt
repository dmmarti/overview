Iron Lord is a strategy game with action and light adventure elements, set in the Middle Ages and featuring hand-drawn graphics. After returning from journeys far away, you find your ancestral castle in ruins, and hear rumors that a huge army is marching towards your land. Your only hope is to raise an army and fight back, but after your long absence you are an unknown heir to the land. To raise the army you need to win the respect of the people, by traveling through your land and accomplishing tasks, win competitions, and finally gather enough men to fight the army.
