Typhoon Thompson in Search of the Sea Child is an enhanced remake of the Apple II game Airheart. It is an unusual game where you have to fly round an ocean and shoot at various unusual beasts.  The plot centers around a Sea Child who was stolen, and Typhoon Thompson is sent in to rescue it, with the guidance of a few strange, cowled ghost-types (who would occasionally be nasty to poor old TT).  While the original game was controllable with a joystick, this game is mouse controlled.
