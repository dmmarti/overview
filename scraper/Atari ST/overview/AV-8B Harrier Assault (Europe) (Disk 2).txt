This game puts you behind the controls of the AV8B Harrier aircraft. You must plan a strategic assault upon the enemy island of East Timor which is heavily defended. As well as allowing you to fly the Harrier, you can also plan attacks with your ground and naval forces.  If you prefer the strategic side of things you can let the games AI fly the missions for you, whilst you concentrate on commanding the resources available to you to strike on the enemy.
