'Nikoli's Pencil Puzzle' is a collection of 600 puzzles including Sudoku, Bridges, Boxes and Museum types.    Players mainly use the stylus to work out the several puzzles available or can even use the control pad to move the cursor and select the various numbers on screen (such as Sudoku). Other in-game controls include using the Circle Pad to scroll across the game board, Y to undo your last move and the Start button to bring up the Pause Menu filled with a variety of game options.    The game also utilises hints for players in case they get stuck, but these can only be obtained by spending Play Coins for each hint bought within the Pause Menu.    There are 3 save files to save in-game progress and also includes the option to save the current puzzle at any time.
