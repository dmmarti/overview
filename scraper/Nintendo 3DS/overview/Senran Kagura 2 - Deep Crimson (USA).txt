The ninja girls are back! Senran Kagura 2 is a direct sequel to the original Senran Kagura, picking up the story at the final chapter of that game. While the basic beat-'em-up gameplay has not changed much, new in this installment is the Pair Battle system, which allows control of two characters for certain missions, switching between them on the fly. Certain character combinations will even allow for special combination attacks, and it's even possible for the rival Hanz? and Hebijo teams to fight together.
