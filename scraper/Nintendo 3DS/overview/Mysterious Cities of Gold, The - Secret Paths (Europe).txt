The Mysterious Cities of Gold: Secret Paths is an adventure game based on the 2012 TV series The Mysterious Cities of Gold. The game features several key parts from the series: the music, cut-scenes and main characters. The game was released in episodic form, as levels were unlocked at the same time when a new episode on the television aired. The first five episodes were released for free, the others must be bought.    The player controls the three main characters Esteban, Zia and Tao. They must escape Zares and his men by solving puzzles and overcoming obstacles. Each character has a unique skill and all three must be combined to solve the puzzles. Estaban has the ability to unlock mechanisms, where Zia has the option to move through narrow spaces and Tao can decipher any language from the allegedly lost continent of Mu.    The search for the Mysterious Cities of Gold takes the characters through China. The player explores several different regions, including the Forbidden City, a lush tropical forest and eventually the Chinese City of Gold. For all listed platforms a complete version of the game is available. For iOS there is a full version as well as a free version with in-app purchases.
