Become the manager of a hotel for cats and dogs and take care of your pets. Take your puppy out for a walk in the park, teach them to jump over a skipping rope, pet them and play frisbee with them. Brush your cat, teach them to hunt, train them for an obstacle course... and make them purr!    Choose between 16 breeds of cats and dogs: Dalmatian, Labrador, Husky, Siamese, tabby and more... and play hide-and-seek with your pet with the AR Cards which came with your Nintendo 3DS!
