Imagine Fashion Life introduces a brand-new ultra-realistic fashion game on the Nintendo 3DS system where players can experience three fabulous fashion careers: fashion design, modeling and mall owner! The 3D game features high-quality, realistic graphics and allows players with a love of all things fashion to truly unleash their creativity and business savvy. Players can create original outfits and organize fashion shows as a fashion designer. As a top model, players can pose for glamorous photo shoots and set the catwalks ablaze with perfect runway walks. As a successful mall owner, players can open and arrange stores, decorate the mall, promote the trendiest cosmetics and fashion brands in stores, and manage their budget to create a world-class mall.
