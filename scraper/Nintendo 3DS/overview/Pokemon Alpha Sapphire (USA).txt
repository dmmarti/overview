Prepare for an epic adventure exploring a world filled with PokÃ©mon in PokÃ©mon Alpha Sapphire for the Nintendo 3DS family of systems. Your adventure takes place in Hoenn, a region that consists of a main island that stretches widely from east to west, along with countless small islets that dot the deep blue sea around it. A live volcano steams constantly in the heart of this green-covered island. Look forward to a region rich with natural beauty, a variety of PokÃ©mon, and extraordinary people! During your journey through Hoenn, youâ€™ll be able to build and invite friends to visit your personal Super-Secret Base! Come up with your own Secret Base design, including selecting and placing Decorations however you like. You can also use Super-Secret Bases to play a capture-the-flag activity. Stop Team Aqua from going after the Legendary PokÃ©mon Kyogre. Also look out for Omega Ruby and all new Mega Evolutions as well.
