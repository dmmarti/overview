Created and developed by 5TH Cell, Scribblenauts Unlimited features a huge side-scrolling open world with new, high-definition hand-drawn scenery and objects where players can help the game's hero, Maxwell, solve robust puzzles and challenges by summoning any object they can imagine. Players can leverage the Nintendo 3DS Street Pass functionality to see all of the creative puzzle solutions by other players in the area. And for the first time, learn the backstory about Maxwell's parents, his twin sister Lily, and how he got his magical notepad.
