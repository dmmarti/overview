Having received tremendous acclaim in its previous releases on PC and WiiWare, Cave Story, an indie side scrolling 2D action game, now makes its way into an all new dimension with Cave Story 3D for Nintendo 3DS. At once both a throwback to classic 2D action platformers and also the potential future of the genre, Cave Story 3D blends tight controls, superb level design, and excellent story and presentation to deliver a memorable, addicting retro experience!
