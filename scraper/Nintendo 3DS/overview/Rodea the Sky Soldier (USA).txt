Rodea the Sky Soldier is an action-adventure video game developed by Prope for the Wii and Kadokawa Games for the Wii U and Nintendo 3DS. The game stars Rodea, an android who possesses the ability to fly and a "heart". These traits result in Rodea becoming a soldier in order to fulfill his promise of protecting the kingdom of Garuda, a series of islands that float in the sky, from the ground-based Naga Empire and its leader, Emperor Geardo. Although development was completed in 2011, Rodea the Sky Soldier went unreleased for four years until finally seeing a release in Japan in April 2015, and then a subsequent worldwide release in November 2015.
