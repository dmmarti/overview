3D MahJongg is a new take on the old game of Mahjong Solitaire (a.k.a. Shanghai Solitaire). It uses the same set of 144 tiles. The object of the game is simple; find two matching tiles that are not blocked by other tiles on either side (up and down is not an option), and slowly whittle away at the layout till all of the tiles have been removed. While simple in practice, the possibilities are endless.    The game has two sets of rules, Rivers and Classic. In Rivers, tiles must be on the same layer, and the line connecting them may not change direction more than twice. In Classic, tiles must not be covered by other tiles, and must be free to their left or right side.    The game has two modes: Free Play and Adventure mode which has 200 combinations of the available options you must solve completely before moving forward. There is no basic "save" feature, but rather you create a profile, and if you turn off the 3DS it will start you at the next level to be completed when you return to Adventure mode.    The layout is viewed on the touch screen and the 3D screen. You chose your matching tiles (or the option to rewind or fast forward your moves) on the touch screen, and a 3D representation of the layout is seen on the upper screen.    The layouts are represented in 3D and with 50 different types, along with six different animated 3D backgrounds called "Scenes", as well as six different touch screen backgrounds, and six different tile sets which includes sea creatures, zombies, fantasy characters and traditional playing cards. Like many puzzle games with multiple options, you have to unlock the additional layouts, scenes, backgrounds and tile sets, which is done through Adventure mode.
