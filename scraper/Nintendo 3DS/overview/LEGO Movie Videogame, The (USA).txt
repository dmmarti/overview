The LEGO Movie Videogame for handheld and mobile platforms plays very similar to the console versions, except that gameplay is viewed from an isometric view instead of the third-person view. The in-game cutscenes consist of FMV sequences taken from the 2014 film of the same name (just like the other console versions).    Controls for the 3DS version include using the Circle Pad to move characters, the L and R buttons to swap characters in the levels, Y and X to attack (for short and far ranges, respectively), B to dodge and A to build several LEGO objects, as well as interacting with other characters and objects.    The 3DS version includes a total of 15 stages to complete and include timed quests (which grant the player gold bricks that add towards the completion percentage) to carry out against the clock. Emmet and Wildstyle are the main characters controlled during the story, though more characters can be unlocked later to find inaccessible collectibles in Free Play mode.
