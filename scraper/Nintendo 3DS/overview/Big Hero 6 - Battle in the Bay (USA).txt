'Big Hero 6: Battle In The Bay' is a 2D action platformer based on the 2014 Walt Disney animated classic film 'Big Hero 6'.    The game's events take place after the film, in which Hiro Hamada (along with his friends Gogo Tomago, Wasabi, Fred, Honey Lemon and the lovable Baymax) must save his hometown of San Fransokyo from a battlebot invasion.    Players get the chance to control all 6 members of the squad, each with the hero's own unique abilities: Hiro and his platforming skills, Gogo's speed, Fred's over-the-top power and Wasabi's combat skills. Baymax and Honey Lemon also appear to support the players throughout the game's numerous levels. Each level is meant to reflect the talents of a particular character, along with a wide arrange of enemies and environmental hazards.     Gameplay also includes collecting upgrades for the team, as well as unique Challenge Mode versions of each level.
