Hidden Expedition: Titanic is an hidden object game with adventure elements. You have a list of objects to find and when you spot one, you click on it in order to collect it. Be careful to the time limit, as it represents also your oxygen reserve. At the end of each successful dive, you have to beat a mini-game for progressing in the game.    The plotline is simple: you're a member of The Hidden Expedition Adventure League and you've been contacted by the Titanic Museum foundation for finding the Queen's jeweled crown who was aboard the boat.    If you get stuck, you can use the limited number of hints.
