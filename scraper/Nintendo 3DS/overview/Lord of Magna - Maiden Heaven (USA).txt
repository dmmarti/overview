An exciting new strategy RPG with a unique "bowling" battle system to blast enemies into others for massive combos!     Residing on the outskirts of town as the proprietor of a quiet, rustic inn, Luchs has lived through much of his life proudly clinging to a code of honor passed down from father to son: "When our cherished guests finally arrive, think of them as nothing less than family."     Unfortunately, the inn has not yet had even a single guest since its foundation, leaving Luchs no choice but to excavate and sell crystals - a valuable fuel source - in order to make ends meet. It is during one such routine excavation that he happens upon a beautiful maiden encased inside a massive crystal, and her abrupt awakening triggers a series of unexpected events that include foul fiends, astonishing abilities, and miraculous mysteriesâ€¦
