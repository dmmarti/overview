The games offer 13 levels (based around the first and second seasons of the TV series), which mostly consist of the platform puzzle-solving layout as previous LEGO video game efforts (whilst defeating a multitude of droids along the way as well as other familiar foes). Most levels also take place in flight-mode, where players need to carry out several missions e.g. defeating an army of vulture droids. Each level is split into 3 acts (which are then available to play separately as part of Free Play mode).
