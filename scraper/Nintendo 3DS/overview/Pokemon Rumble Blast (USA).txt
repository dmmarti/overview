Pokemon Rumble Blast, the first Pokemon game created exclusively for the Nintendo 3DS system, is an action-packed Pokemon adventure in 3D! Battle against waves of opponents, connect and play with friends, and collect more than 600 different Toy Pokemon!     As you advance through each stage in Pokemon Rumble Blast, your Toy Pokemon will face dozens of Pokemon at once in fast and furious real-time battles! You'll also run into giant Boss Pokemon, whose massive size and strength will make them especially tough to defeat and who can become powerful allies if you're lucky!
