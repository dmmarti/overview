Plug into a New Adventure with Chibi-Robo! Our tiny hero is geared up to save the world in his own HUGE plaformer! Whip and swing his powerful plug and cord to grapple and zipline through tricky, trap-ridden corridors. Then power-up into Super Chibi-Robo by tapping in your Chibi-Robo amiibo figure, all while collecting real-world munchies across dozens of levels.    As you make your way through each stage, use your whip lash attack to make scrap metal out of smaller enemies, or ricochet a powerful zip lash attack off of surfaces to scale the highest walls or defeat the toughest enemies. Collect boost balls to extend the reach of your cord and use this newfound power to discover brand-new areas! The world wonâ€™t save itself, so get out there and satiate your hunger for action and adventure (or delicious munchies)!
