Hatsune Miku: Project Mirai 2 is a rhythm game created by Sega and Crypton Future Media for the Nintendo 3DS. Like the original, the game primarily makes use of Vocaloids, most notably the virtual-diva Vocaloid Hatsune Miku. While Project Mirai only had button controls, Project Mirai 2 adds use of touch screen controls where players tap the bottom screen. An increased sense of speed and additional gimmicks have also been added.     An updated version of Project Mirai 2 intended for worldwide release, Project Mirai DX makes the following changes:       - All videos were removed, and replaced with newly created real-time animations       - One new song was added       - Some charts were slightly modified       - Six songs were given exclusive new higher-difficulty charts
