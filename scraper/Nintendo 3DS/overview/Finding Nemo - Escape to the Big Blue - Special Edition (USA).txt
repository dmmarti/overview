Like Marlin always tells you, the Big Blue is a dangerous place. From stinging jellyfish to hungry sharks and creepy deep-sea creatures, there's no shortage of ways for a little clownfish to get into big trouble. But along with the hazards, the ocean gives life to excitement, adventure and freedom. It's time to venture from the safety of your anemone and plunge into the wide, watery world beyond. Stretch out your fins, brush up on your whale-ish and remember to just keep swimming as you join Nemo, Marlin and the loveable, yet forgetful Dory on a wild adventure based on the popular Disney/Pixar fish tale, Finding Nemo.
