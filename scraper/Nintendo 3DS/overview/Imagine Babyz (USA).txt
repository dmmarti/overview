Another game in the Ubisoft's Imagine series of games that show female children and early teenagers the basics of some of the professions culturally assigned to women.    This time, the player takes the role of a young baby-sitter. As a young student looking for making some money, you can baby-sit a total of 6 different babies, one at a time or some of them together. The tasks you have to perform go from cleaning, dressing and feeding the baby to other house errands like shopping, dish washing and cleaning the baby's room and many other ones. In addition, you can spend the earned money on decorating your house.    As usual, you can share stuff, like, for example, photos of your kids, through the wireless connection.
