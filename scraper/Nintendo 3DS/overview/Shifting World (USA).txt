Based on the Portal-inspired Flash game called Shift, Shifting World on 3DS features the same basic premise but with added features and expanded content. Shifting World has players guiding a man who has been forcibly transported into another dimension. To help find his way back home, you must run, jump, and "shift" the environment -- transforming black into white and vice versa -- so you can find a path to escape.
