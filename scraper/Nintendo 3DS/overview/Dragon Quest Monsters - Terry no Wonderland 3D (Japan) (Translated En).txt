Dragon Quest Monsters: Terry's Wonderland 3D is a remake of the 1998 monster-recruiting role-playing game Dragon Warrior Monsters. The game world has been updated to be rendered in three dimensions and the gameplay has been changed to be similar to Dragon Quest Monsters: Joker 2, with the player encountering monsters and either defeating or recruiting them to fight against other monsters, but with the addition of a fourth slot in the player's party. Players can also import their data from Joker 2 (including the Professional version) using a downloadable app.
