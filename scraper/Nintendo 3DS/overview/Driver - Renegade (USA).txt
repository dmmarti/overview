Tanner is back and full of rage in the new Driver Renegade for the Nintendo 3DS. Driver Renegade takes place between the stories of Driver 1 and Driver 2. After years of undercover work for the NYPD, John Tanner leaves his badge and takes protection under Senator Ballard to take care of crime in his own way. As a renegade, Tanner cleans up the New York streets and punishes those that oppose him. Driver Renegade brings non- stop 3D car chases to the Nintendo 3DS system.
