Sports Island 3D marks the debut of HUDSON SOFT's fun series for Nintendo 3DS, and allows up to four players to participate in events designed to show off the 3D capabilities of the new format. The ten sports on offer are Soccer, Tennis, Basketball, Ice Hockey, Snowball Fighting, Sumo Wrestling, Bowling, Snowmobile Racing, Sport Blowgun and Trampoline. Each demands different skills from the user, and has been designed to make stunning use of the additional depth of field the format offers.
