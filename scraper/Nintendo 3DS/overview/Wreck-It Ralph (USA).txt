The Wreck-It Ralph video game brings you all the action from the 2012 Walt Disney Animation Studios film of the same name.    The video game's storyline takes place after the film's events, in which Wrect-It Ralph and Fix-It Felix Jr. discover a new Cy-Bug invasion and must save the video gaming world once again with their famed wrecking and repairing skills.    The main gameplay consists of guiding Ralph and Felix through several platforming levels in 3 worlds (Fix-It Felix Jr., Sugar Rush and Hero's Duty) within Game Central (the game's main hub). Wreck-It Ralph's abilities include smashing wooden crates, a ground pound to defeat enemies and pushing and pulling several objects, while Fix-It Felix Jr.'s abilities include double-jumping, wall-jumping, throwing his prized hammer and even repairing broken objects.    Scattered throughout the levels include coins (that add towards your score), Hero Medals and even Easter Eggs (which are stored in the Trophy Room, even unlocking bonus concept artwork from the film). Cutscenes in-between levels also include vocal dialogue for every character.
