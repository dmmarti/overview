Mario and Luigi embark on the adventure of their dreams in a hilarious action RPG that combines the resort world of Pi'illo Island with the wild landscapes of Luigi's imagination, where anything can happen. Meet a host of hilarious characters as you strive to rescue Princess Peach and help Prince Dreambert free his petrified Pi'illo people from the bat-king Antasma's curse.    Features:    * Spawn hundreds of Luigis that mold into different forms like bouncy towers, wrecking balls and giant hammers for special attacks or to pass obstacles.  * Poke, tickle and move a sleeping Luigi on the lower touch screen to alter the dream world on the upper screen.  * Master two worlds by switching between controlling both brothers when battling in the real world and controlling Mario and an army of Luigis in dream-world battles.  * With the Nintendo 3DS system turned sideways like a book, experience larger-than-life Giant Battles with a gargantuan-size Luigi on one screen and the enemy on the other screen.  * Find new items and gear to customize Mario &amp; Luigi to fit your play style.  * To help players through the adventure, the game offers various support features, like a Hint System that offers tips on surviving a particular engagement, or an Easy Mode to make a particular battle easier.
