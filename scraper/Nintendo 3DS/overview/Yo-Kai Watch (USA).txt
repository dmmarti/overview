The YO-KAI WATCH game is about hundreds of sometimes cute, sometimes spooky, and usually mischievous Yo-kai that inhabit our world. Yo-kai are not ghosts, monsters or creatures. Yo-kai are, quite simply, Yo-kai. They cannot be seen by the human eye, but they are everywhere. Whether born from the soul of a deceased human, or an everyday object discovering its higher purpose, their personalities are distinctly humanlike.     As you explore the world, use your Yo-kai Watch to find them, befriend them, and turn them into a team to battle other Yo-kai. Befriending new Yo-kai may not be so easy, though â€“ in many cases, you will need to battle with them and impress them during your battle. Each Yo-kai has its own unique skills and strengths and youâ€™ll use them to challenge the evil Yo-kai and help people in need of solving daily problems â€“ like an argument with a friend or forgetting something important â€“ which may be caused by mischievous Yo-kai hidden everywhere.
