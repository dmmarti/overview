Putty Squad is a 1994 video game developed by System 3 and published by Maximum Games and Ocean Software. It was originally developed for the Amiga 1200, but that version was not released until the end of 2013; prior to that date the SNES version was the only one to be released. Sega Mega Drive and MS-DOS ports also existed, but were cancelled. It is the sequel to Putty (1992). In December 2013, the Amiga version was released as a Christmas gift on System 3's website. In October 2015, the Mega Drive version was also released by a Sega-16 user who got a hold of a working prototype.
