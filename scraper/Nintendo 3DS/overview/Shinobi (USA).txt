Betrayed by your friend you must battle an ancient and evil clan in this epic reboot of the acclaimed Shinobi series. Shinobi captures the classic side-scrolling action from the original Shinobi games. This coupled with intense combat in exotic locations and over the top boss encounters is what players have loved since the early days of the series.
