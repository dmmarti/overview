NARUTO Powerful Shippuden includes a Story Mode as well as an Endless Battle Mode so players can choose to either follow a progressive storyline or just pull out the punches for a sprightly ninja showdown. The action-packed gameplay allows players to earn experience points to power up their vivacious characters and also use the touch screen to strengthen special attacks. Fans will recognize their favorite characters from the NARUTO franchise such as Kakashi, Sakura, Gaara, and many more; all can be called upon as support characters in the midst of battle. With familiar friends at their sides and ninja moves up their sleeves, players will embark on the journey of becoming a powerful Leaf ninja to knock out opponents or even become a knock-out with sexy jutsu.
