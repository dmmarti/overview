Set in Barbie's hometown Willows, and inspired by the upcoming DVD Barbie and her Sisters in the Great Puppy Adventure, players will join Barbie and her sisters - Skipper, Stacie and Chelsea - as they solve clues to find and rescue lost puppies in need. Kids can customize kennels with toys, blankets, beds and decor at Rescue HQ. Each sister will bring their own unique set of skills and activities to the game. Players can groom puppies at Chelsea's Pup Care or teach them new tricks at the Pup Camp with Stacie!
