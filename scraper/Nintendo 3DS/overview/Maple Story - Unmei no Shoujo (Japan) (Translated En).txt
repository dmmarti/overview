MapleStory: The Girlâ€™s Fate is the first title from the franchise to be released on the 3DS and represents a big step forward for the series. It sees you take control of a young girl who has a mysterious spirit trapped inside her and the only way for her to be rid of it is to head out on an adventure!    The game will retain its simplistic look and playing style, with characters drawn up as sprites and everything being controlled by a single button. In keeping with the RPG genre you'll be able to customise your character by selecting her weapon speciality and giving her a specific skill set.    Surprisingly, MapleStory: The Girlâ€™s Fate is a single player game and doesn't feature any MMO elements. It will be hitting South Korean shelves on 25th April; the series is gaining momentum in the West, so we wouldn't rule out an eventual localisation completely.
