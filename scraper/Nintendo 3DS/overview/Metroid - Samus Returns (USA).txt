Metroid: Samus Returns is a side-scrolling action-adventure video game developed collaboratively by MercurySteam and Nintendo, with the latter also publishing it for the Nintendo 3DS handheld game console. A part of the science fiction Metroid series, the game is a reimagining of the 1991 Game Boy game Metroid II: Return of Samus, and was released worldwide on 15 September 2017. It follows series protagonist Samus Aran, who is sent by the Galactic Federation to exterminate the parasitic Metroids on their home planet of SR388.  The game features a story and structure similar to Metroid II but with new controls, visuals, and gameplay. It also introduces some features that are new to the 2D Metroid games, such as melee counterattacks, an ability to fire freely at any angle, and a selection of different abilities. The development on Samus Returns began in 2015, with longtime Metroid developer Yoshio Sakamoto producing it. The game was met with positive reception from video game journalists, who praised its visuals and improved gameplay over the original game, with many viewing it as a return to form for the series.
