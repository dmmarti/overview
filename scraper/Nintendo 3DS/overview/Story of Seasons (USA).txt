Story of Seasons is a farming simulation video game developed by Marvelous Entertainment for the Nintendo 3DS. It was released in Japan on February 27, 2014, and in North America on March 31, 2015. The game is not under the Harvest Moon title in North America due to Natsume's ownership of the name. However, less than a month later, Natsume themselves announced their own original title, not produced by Marvelous, Harvest Moon: The Lost Valley released only in North America and Europe, also released in 2014 for the Nintendo 3DS.    The game follows along the same lines as the rest of the series, in which the player takes on the role of a farmer. The player can choose to play a boy or girl farmer. The player can choose between two difficulties at the beginning of the game, but this cannot be changed once the choice is made. There are a variety of things to do in this game, such as producing crops and raising livestock. Story of Seasons introduces new characters, including a tiny goddess and a tiny witch.
