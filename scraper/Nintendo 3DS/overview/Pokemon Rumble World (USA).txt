Control cute Toy Pokemon and have exhilarating battles in Pokemon Rumble World! This downloadable game for systems in the Nintendo 3DS family is packed with Pokemon that you can battle and befriend. You can collect 719 species of Pokemon: all the ones that have appeared in the video games up through Pokemon Omega Ruby and Pokemon Alpha Sapphire. When you defeat one of the wild Pokemon you meet in a stage, it sometimes becomes your friend. Even Mega-Evolving Pokemon will join the battles, a first for a game in the Pokemon Rumble series!        Befriend as many Pokemon as you can: as you collect more species of Pokemon, your Adventurer Rank goes up. As your Adventurer Rank goes up, the shop will offer more products, and stages will feature stronger Pokemon.        It's not just Pokemon that will appear in Pokemon Rumble World. Your Mii character will also appear in your game, as well as the Mii characters of players you pass! It's the first time in the Pokemon Rumble series that Mii characters have joined in to interact with Pokemon and have adventures together.        Your story is set in the kingdom of toys, and the adventure starts when the king summons you. He explains his frustration at having only one Pikachu. In contrast, a mysterious magician has captured several Pokemon! So the king asks you to show that magician a thing or two by collecting lots more Pokemon, and he lends you his Pikachu to get you started on your adventures. Depart from the castle town via a hot-air balloon to get to different areas where wild Toy Pokemon await!        It's fun to connect with other friends playing Pokemon Rumble World. Players can visit your castle town via StreetPass. Connect your Nintendo 3DS system to the Internet, and Mii characters of faraway players will visit you. They can even provide support for you in future battles in a variety of ways.        Poke Diamonds are meant to make your adventures even more exciting and easy. With Poke Diamonds, you can get hot-air balloons, clothes for your Mii character, extras that provide more fun in your game play, and more. In addition, Poke Diamonds can be used to continue playing in a stage after your Pokemon's HP runs out, as well as to re-inflate hot-air balloons that have become deflated after use. You can acquire them in various ways, including at the beginning of the adventure and when you speak to Mii characters who come to the castle town via StreetPass. You can also purchase Poke Diamonds at the shop in the castle town via Nintendo eShop.
