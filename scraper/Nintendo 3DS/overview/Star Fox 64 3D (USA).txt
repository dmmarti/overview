The Star Fox team triumphantly returns to one of its greatest missions with this remake of Star Fox 64 in full 3D, featuring a complete graphical update.    The entire Star Fox universe spreads out realistically into the depths of the Nintendo 3DS screen while the 3D visuals give the player a clearer grasp of distance and position. This makes the game more approachable and intuitive, thereby allowing players to focus on the action.
