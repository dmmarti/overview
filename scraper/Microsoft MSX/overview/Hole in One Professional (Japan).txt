This is the second golf game from HAL Laboratory after Hole in One. Like it's predecessor, Hole in One Professional is a standard 18-hole golf game, played from a top-down perspective. Players can compete in stroke play with up to four players, or match play against a friend or the computer. When playing against the computer, the player will play against an opponent that uses metal clubs, which hit farther than the standard wooden clubs. 
 
In addition to stroke and match play, players can obtain passwords that allow a replay of any spectacular shots that are made (eagles, holes-in-one, and double-eagles).
