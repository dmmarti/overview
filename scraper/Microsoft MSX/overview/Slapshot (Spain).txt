SLAP-SHOT! Hockey is a fast-action ice hockey simulation game. Each ice hockey match has three periods that last three minutes each. 
The puck can be passed from player to player at varying speeds and directions. The game allows you to give opponents a body check and you can even control the strength of it. 
However, when you are playing too roughly it is possible that you'll get penalized. 
 
To win a match you will have to develop a good match strategy, good skating and passing skills and quick reflexes. 
 
This game can be played by one or two players.
