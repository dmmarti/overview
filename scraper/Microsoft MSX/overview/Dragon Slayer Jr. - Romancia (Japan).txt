Dragon Slayer is an action RPG in which you control a nameless knight who must fight his way through maze-like dungeons. Monsters will frequently attack you and chase you if you run away. The combat takes place on the same screen as the exploration and is real-time. You gain experience points for defeated enemies and become stronger with the time. Warp points teleport you to other areas, and there are weapons, armor, and treasure to find along your way.
