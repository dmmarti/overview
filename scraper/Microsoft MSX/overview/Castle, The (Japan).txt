The puzzle and platform game Castle Excellent is a sequel to The Castle. In Castle Excellent you control a prince that has to save the princess again.  
 
To find your princess you have to explore the castle, which has 100 different rooms. Each room is a puzzle on its own as you have to avoid enemy knights, fat Tiroler men, hazardous objects and have to use objects to get to the next door.
