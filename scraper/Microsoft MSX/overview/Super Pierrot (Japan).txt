This game is the sequel to Mr. Do's Wild Ride and the fourth title in the "Mr. Do!" series. You control Mr. Do, a clown, and guide him trough a field with varying elevation levels, with balls placed on it. You must collect those balls to replenish your weapon, a ball that you throw at your enemies. A trail (shown as a line) follows you while moving around. The area you moved turns gray and will be uncovered. All the balls in that gray area turn into cherries. And, if you do the same with the cherries, they will be upgraded to oranges. The oranges can be upgraded to lemons and finally the lemons upgraded to pineapples. Hidden under the field is a letter (in the shape of a coin), which can be used for the "EXTRA" at the top of the screen. When any of the letters that spell the word "EXTRA" are collected an army of enemies that follows you show up and one of those enemies holds the letter that you touched. 
To obtain the letter you must kill that enemy. Now you can collect the other letters. When you obtained all the letters that spell the word "EXTRA" you will receive a bonus. 
On the field are logs, which can be unleashed by walking next to the side that is propped up. The log rolls down and kills all enemies it rolls over. But be careful! It can kill you too! To continue to the next round, you can kill all enemies or collect all the balls or fruits.
