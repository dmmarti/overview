The ancient game of chess is recreated here, with all the traditional rules and game concepts. The game is in 2D, as the programmers felt this was the most effective use of available memory. Controls involve moving a pointer over the square to move a piece from, pressing space, then moving to the destination square and pressing space again. You can set the amount of time players (human and computer) have to plan moves, although an over-ride option to force a move instantly also exists. You can save and reload games, and at any point can move pieces either from current settings or from scratch, to completely customise the game or play out classic positions.
