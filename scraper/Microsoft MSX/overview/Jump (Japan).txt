This arcade game is a cross between Breakout and Space Invaders. Player controls an electromechanical robot, who walks along the top of a wall consisting of bricks and jumps on it. A line of bugs is coming to him from the bottom of the screen in vertical direction, while the bomb is flying in horizontal direction in the center. Bugs may be killed by jumping on the wall, which results in a brick falling from its bottom. The number of jumps is equal to the bottom brick's distance from the robot. Flying bomb may eliminate the brick until it reaches the bug, but if the bug is killed, its bad or good soul will fly to the top, where robot may collect it and make influence on his mood. After the bug is eliminated, another one will start to crawl from the bottom. There is a snail moving in horizontal direction at the very bottom of the screen, which is mostly covered by the bugs crawling to the top, and it may be hit by brick in case of success also.  
 
The player is transferred to another level after necessary quantity of the bugs is killed. But beware! Robot's energy is exhausted, when bug is crawling upon him, and the robot becomes non-functional if the bugs reached the very top of the screen or if the robot falls off the wall.
