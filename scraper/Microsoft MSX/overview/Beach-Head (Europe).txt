A dictator took the control of a fortress on the island of Kuhn-Lin. 
 
Your mission is to storm the island and recapture it. This takes place over the course of 6 different sequences. The first sequence is Aerial Reconnissance where the fleet must be moved directly past the enemy or into a hidden passage. Optional is this Hidden Passage sequence, where the player will have to manuever around mines and torpedos. Once encountering the enemy, the General Quaters sequence starts, where the player controls anti-aircraft guns shooting down enemy aircraft. The next sequence is named Battle Stations and the player must aim and fire heavy guns to aim at the enemy ships before they get too close. Following this fleet battle, the player's fleet must be manuvered to the beach. Upon reaching the Beach-head, tanks roll out and the player must keep these safe from enemy fire. In the Final Battle sequence, the Dictator is holed up in the fortress of Kuhn-Lin and 10 different targets on the fortress must be fired upon to destroy it.
