Gradius 2 is a side scrolling shoot 'm up. Shooting enemies will leave a power up pod behind which can be collected to add more power to your space ship. Every level features a wide variety of enemies trying to stop you, with a large boss at the end. Gameplay is for one player or two players alternating.
