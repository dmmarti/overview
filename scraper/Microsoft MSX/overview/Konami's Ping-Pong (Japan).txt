Ping Pong recreates the fast-paced sport of table tennis. To win each match you must get to 10 points with a 2 point lead - if the scores reach 10-9 the game goes on until someone has a 2 point lead or reaches 15, in a similar manner to tennis. There are nine skill levels to beat, with increasing abilities as the game goes on. The human player has the advantage of serving first, and as the serve reverses every five points, you are guaranteed to have more chances to serve than your opponent (remember the significance of 10 and 15 in the scoring). The points system rewards long rallies and large winning margins, as you get points for each hit, for each point won, and for each point of the winning margin.
