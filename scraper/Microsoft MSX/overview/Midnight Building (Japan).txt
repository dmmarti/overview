In Midnight Building you control a man who is running around in a dark labyrinth. You'll start at floor eight and work all the way down to floor one. 
 
At the beginning of each round the labyrinth floor is shortly visible, giving you the opportunity to locate the keys and the vault in the labyrinth. After a few seconds the labyrinth turns black. Only your direct surroundings of the labyrinth lightened. 
 
Now it becomes your goal to collect all the keys, open the vault with the collected keys and then return to the middle of the labyrinth to enter the door and go to the next floor. 
 
There are at least three hostile green men running around in the labyrinth who are trying to catch you. You'll loose a life when they catch you.
