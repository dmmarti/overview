A platform shooter from Japan, Thexder offers many levels and diverse enemies that gradually increase in difficulty.  You pilot a Battletech-style robot capable of switching from a 'mech into a jet at any time.  Your weapon auto-aims, but uses up a fixed amount of rechargable energy; if you run out of this energy, you'll have to wait a few seconds before you can fire again.  Your 'mech also contains a shield that can be activated to protect you from harm, but this lasts for a few seconds and uses up some of your life energy.
