This is a re-hash of one of the oldest computer games ever, namely the submarine game. Atari players may for example remember Air-Sea Battle from way back in 1977. The premise is that you, as captain on a submarine, must shoot at mine-releasing surface ships and sub-hunting planes, all the while avoiding enemy submarines and their torpedoes. The key to playing the game correctly is to properly time your missiles/torpedoes, as well as taking their trajectory into account.
