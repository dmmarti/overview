A special version of the original F-1 Spirit, A1 Spirit: The Way To Formula-1, was released as a pack-in with Panasonic's "Joy Handle" game controller. The chief differences is that it features futuristic vehicles instead of racing cars, different passwords (e.g. "PANASONIC" to see the ending demo), and some bugfixes.
