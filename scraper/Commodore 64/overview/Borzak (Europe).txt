Borzak has crashed his spcecraft on a strange marshy planet and to make matters worse, during the crash he managed to separate himself from his craft and must now attempt to get back to it over five levels. The game is viewed from the side as the screen scrolls constantly from left to right, and you must control Borzak by jumping over the many gaps and avoid the various creatures and obstacles. Borzak is equipped with Antigrav which allows him to jump great distances but he has no control over when he lands again but he is able to jump shorter distances. The speed of Borzak can be controlled and this will dictate the distance that Borzak travels. If Borzak falls into a gap or touches a creature or obstacle then you lose one of three lives and the starting level can be selected at the start of the game.
