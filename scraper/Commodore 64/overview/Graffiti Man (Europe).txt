You are a graffiti artist who must get through four locations while avoiding all kinds of people that are constantly shooting projectiles or objects at you. These people include old men, police officers, skaters, and women that throw flowerpots on your head. If you come into contact with people, you will lose a life. When you get hit by a projectile or object, you lose one of your spray cans, and if you run out of these, you will also lose a life. When you get to the end of each location, you will reach a wall where you can spray-paint on. If you spray over the specific regions, you will get rewarded for your effort. You are on a time limit on these sections, and when time runs out, you move to the next location. When you have completed this short game, you are treated to a paint program that lets you spray-paint at your own free will, without a time limit. You can choose the size of the paint, its color and density. In the Amiga version, you can also clear the display if you make a mistake.
