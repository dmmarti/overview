This strange piece of software that, as the name states, allows you to host your very own murder party. Murder parties, so it seems, are a cross between a party game and a theatrical play, very popular for more than a hundred years now. The host gathers a great amount of fictional facts and clues, and hands it to the players/actors in turns. At the end, every player (and/or spectators) try to guess who among the players is the murderer, and how he did it and what was the motive. The winner is he who gets the most facts right, or, in case no one can guess right, the murderer wins. The software is the ultimate tool for the murder party host. You simply input a large amount of data from the guests of your future party, and it automatically mixes their data with the story and generates a murder, motives and a large amount of clues, all to be printed into personal booklets for each player. It even generates the invitations to be mailed to the guests. It also provides a good share of hints on how to host a better murder party, with advice ranging from mood setting, music and costumes to even handing out recipes for three-course dinners. Once the booklets have been printed out, though, the computer is no longer necessary, and it's all up to the host and guests to make the party happen. It features two built in scenarios, Empire and Big Kill, each with different stories, characters and settings. And with each time the murderer and motives being generated at random, it makes for a good deal of parties to take place. Up to 8 players can join the fun.
