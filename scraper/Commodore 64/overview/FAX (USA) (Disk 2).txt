Fax is a trivia game from Exidy. One or two players are asked multiple-choice questions that cover about four topics, including general knowledge, sports, history, and entertainment. There are more than 4800 questions and three difficulty levels. While players take the time to answer, two timers are shown. The timer at the top of the screen is shown as a bar and indicates the total time of the current round. The timer at the bottom of the screen consists of four digits, and indicates the score the player gets when they answer a question correctly. If this timer reaches zero, the player receives no score and the game moves on to the next question. The round ends when the top timer is empty. Depending on whether the player has enabled it, a cartoon is shown regardless of a correct or incorrect answer. This cartoon shows a person receiving either a dunce cap or graduation hat.
