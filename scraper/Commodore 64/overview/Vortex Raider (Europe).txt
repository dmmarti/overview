Fly your jet scooter through the 3 terrains of forest, temple and sea in your quest for the Golden Traesure Chest.nnMove the target to guide 2 laser cannons onto various creatures forming the outer defences of the Vortex. Once 5 creatures of a kind have been destroyed, 5 more of another kind must die, before proceding into another deadlier terrain.nnDeeper into the Vortex, more mines and giant mutated eagles block your path. The scanner must be watched carefully, if mines and eagles are to be avoided.nnOnce all 3 terrains have been penetrated, final obstacle lies in your path to the Golden Treasure Chest. You slowly move upwards towards the Treasure, when 2 remaining guardians mutate and attack. Their swooping attacks must be avoided by joystick or keyboard until the Treasure Chest is reached.nnNow claim your Bonus Treasure and proceed to the gruelling challenge of another more difficult zone. If you collide with a guardian, you cannot claim a bonus and must continue with empty pockets.nnNote to RaidersnnYour Bounus is decreasing all the time - Speed is vital!
