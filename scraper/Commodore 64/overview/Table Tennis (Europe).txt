This is the computer version of the sport Table Tennis or Ping Pong. Here you have the chance to play seven other players to become champion. Before you play your game you have the options of exhibition game, tournament, or configure your game. If you configure your game you have the choice of options like how many games (1, 3 or 5), Skill (easy, fair or hard), expedite rule and ball speed (slow, normal or fast). You can also choose your player. Now it's onto the match. The game is a 3D elevated view of the table. The players are just shown as bats but you do see the players hands when serving. Each player serves five times before switching over. Points are scored regardless who is serving. The game is over when 21 points are reached.
