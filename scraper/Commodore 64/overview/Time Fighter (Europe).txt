There are seven time zones that are troubled by hostile opponents. These time zones are prehistoric, Middle Ages, Wild West, Prohibition Era, World War II, 1980's New York and the space age. You are a trans-temporal mercenary sent into these time zones to sort things out. You must defeat the hostiles as well as the creatures. The game is a side-ways scrolling platform game. You can control your character with the joystick to run left or right, jump, duck, punch and kick, and use whatever weapon you are holding. You begin with three lives which are lost when your energy is depleted. Your information panel shows you your energy, lives, score, high score and what weapon you are holding.
