Uchi Mata is a unique tournament-based Judo fighting game in which you play as a judoka in the ultimate tournament. The game is played from a non-scrolling side view. You control your fighter and attempt to get within striking distance of your opponent, however you don't attack directly with your attack button. Instead, your attack command puts you in a fighting stance that allows you to input a series of directional moves. That, combined with the correct feet placement of both fighters (which can be seen in a helpful window) allows you to unleash specific throws and offensive maneuvers that form the basis of the combat in the game. A stamina and health bar also keep your attacks in check, as you may need to rest and build up your strength in order to perform effective attacks.
