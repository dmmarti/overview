The player controls Monty Mole, who must go underground to steal several pieces of coal and eventually take control of coal production. This task is difficult because Monty must survive the dangers that lurk underground, including acid pools, crushers, and other dangerous obstacles. The Commodore 64 version plays slightly different to its Spectrum counterpart. For instance, the screen scrolls as you move Monty around. Also, the C64 version uses an energy bar, which depletes if Monty comes in contact with an obstacle or if he falls. If Monty has no energy left, the game is over. The energy can be restored by collecting a box of worms.
