Panic Express is a flick-screen side-view game where you play the role of Agent X who has to stop a runaway train before it ends up in the hands of the enemy. Starting on the roof of the last carriage, you must walk from right to left over 14 carriages to reach the out of control engine at the front within a time limit. On each screen is one carriage and one type of obstacle that needs avoiding by either jumping or lying down. Obstacles you will encounter are smoke, electrified pads, helicopters dropping bombs and many other obstacles. You also have to jump between the gaps of each carriage and if you hit a gap, hit an obstacle or run out of time then you lose one of six lives.
