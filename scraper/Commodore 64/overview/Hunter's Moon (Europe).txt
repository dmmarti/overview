Your Hunter starship has been sucked into a black hole, and emerged in a region filled with hives of re-spawning cells, most of which have a portal in the middle. Viewed from above, you will have to shoot your way past the hives and into the portals. There are 16 systems, each split into between 4 and 9 levels, and each of these has a number of hives. These are highlighted on a radar at the bottom of the screen, and one of them flashes. If you fly into this one first within a time limit, you will automatically complete the level. Otherwise, you will have to fly into them all. Avoid crashing into the hives, and watch out for the white worker cell, which moves around replacing destroyed hives - contact with this is fatal.
