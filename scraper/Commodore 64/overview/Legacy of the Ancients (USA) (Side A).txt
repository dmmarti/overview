You are a simple shepherd in the world of Tarmalon who one day discovers a panic-driven dying man by the roadside who carries a strange leather bound scroll and a golden bracelet. This begins the adventure in the race against time to destroy the evil scroll and those who wish to kill you to take its power for their own uses. This role-playing game uses the same game engine as Questron. Your journey takes you through overlands, dungeons, towns, castles, oceans, pirate caves and inter-galactic museums to finally face the real threat to the world of Tarmalon. You will have to fight using weapons and magic, gamble, and trade items. Your character is rated for dexterity, strength, charm, endurance and intelligence - skillful play will maximize these.
