Shoot 'em Up Construction Kit is more of a utility than a game. It allows the user to create a huge variety of top down shooters with a simple set of utilities allowing the player to draw, animate and move all of the games sprites, create sound effects and backgrounds for many levels, and set up games rules. The package comes complete with 4 games already made on it, to demonstrate the techniques involved. These include: Slap and Tickle (set in space), Outlaw (a wild west game) Transputer Man (with a strong sci-fi setting) and Celebrity Squares.
