Crime Time is a more or less classical 3rd person point-and-click adventure, with the major difference that you don't click on the graphics, but on controls below the graphics. Actions are done by clicking on words, as is movement. The story is a classical mystery setting: two friends go hitchhiking, and since it's raining so bad, they rest in a small hotel. One of the two starts to drink till he's totally out of control. He stumbles into the wrong room, gets knocked out and wakes up next to a corpse. Now, you have to prove you didn't do anything.
