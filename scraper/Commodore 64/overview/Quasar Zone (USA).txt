You are blasting aliens in a part of the Universe where mega races battle each other for supreme power with spacecrafts that have surpassed the laws of physics. As you blast, most of the aliens have a random attack pattern and can be avoided but certain aliens keep moving across the screen getting lower and these need to be destroyed as they will move across the bottom of the screen and kill you. if you are hit by an alien or its weapon then you lose one of three lives. To move to the next level you need to score 5000 points.
