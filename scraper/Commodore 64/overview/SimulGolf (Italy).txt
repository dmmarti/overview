In the game simulating some kind of golf you should complete the course consisting of 18 stages, putting the ball into the hole with as less strokes of the ball as possible. Each stage is presented on one screen in top-down view, it has a different shape, and different obstacles or gates are set to be avoided or passed through. Setting the ball in the field, you should select the direction and power of the stroke. The points at the end of each stage are calculated as subtraction of made strokes and pre-defined ones different for each stage. The winner is a golfer with a lowest number of points. The number of players (1-4), their names, and courses may be adjusted before the start. In multiplayer mode, each player strikes their balls in the separate fields in turns.
