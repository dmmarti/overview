Life as a monk was good for Brother Jeffrey, tilling the land and making wine made BJ's life content and happy, that is until a green-faced demon came along. Jealous of this happy monk, the demon murdered BJ and to make sure the monk couldn't rest in peace, he removed his bones and hid them deep underground. You take the role of BJ's ghost and you must go underground and find all of his bones in this downwards scrolling maze game viewed from the side with the screen scrolling when you move. As you explore the caverns there are various creatures which must be shot or avoided, as well as obstacles like moving blocks or lightning bolts that also cannot be touched. If you touch a creature then you lose one of nine shields and once all the shields have gone then you lose one of eight lives. Touching the sides of the caverns and obstacles though loses a life.
