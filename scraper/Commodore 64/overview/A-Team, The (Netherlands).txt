In this game, players control a soldier who must shoot four massive heads that belong to those of the four characters from the series. Each head shoots back, and contact with their bullets result in a loss of life. Once the heads are destroyed, the players proceed to the next level. As players progress to new levels, the speed of each head increases, making it difficult for players to avoid bullets.
