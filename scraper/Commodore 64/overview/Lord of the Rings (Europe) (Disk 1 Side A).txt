Lord of the Rings: Game One (releasedin North America as The Fellowship of the Ring: A Software Adventure) is a computer game released in 1985 and based on the book The Fellowship of the Ring, by J. R. R. Tolkien. It was the follow-up to the 1982 game The Hobbit, although did not reach the same level of critical and commercial success as its predecessor, and is considered inferior by the gaming community, with many complaining about the removal of the real-time aspects and complex AI patterns of the previous game, and puzzles that lacked coherent solutions.
