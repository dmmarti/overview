A mercenary must get through a series of checkpoints shooting anyone that stands in his way. To do this, he must cross rivers and make his way through forests and villages. Items can be collected for extra points. If the mercenary comes into contact with any of the enemies, he loses a life; and if all his lives are lost, he then retires. Tottem was programmed using the Shoot 'Em Up Construction Kit.
