In this game the player controls a droid that has to collect mushrooms from eight hazardous caves. Some planning is required on their part, as rocks and poisonous shrubs are scattered everywhere, and they trap the player if they choose the wrong way to reach the mushrooms. Enemy droids and Quango birds appear and pursue the player relentlessly. The player is armed with a limited supply of bombs to use against enemy droids and other obstacles. If players make any contact with enemies or if they are in the vicinity of a bomb when it explodes, the player loses a life. The game ends when all lives are lost.
