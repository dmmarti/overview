In the Muncher, based on the sweets product Chewits, the player takes the role of a prehistoric monster on its quest to retrieve its eggs from Japanese explorers. At the bottom line this plays out as destroying as many houses and attackers as possible to get a high score. The monster has a variety of moves to its disposal, depending on if it is on the ground or currently climbing a building, which includes a limited amount of fireballs. These can be recharged by eating petrol trucks. Another important gameplay mechanics are the above mentioned eggs: if found, they can be brought to waste disposal sites which are abused as breeding grounds. There they basically act as extra lives. When another giant monster is encountered, the screen stops to scroll until it or the player is defeated.
