Hi, my name is Philip Sunset, but my friends call me long hands and my office is one of the best remunerated of the galaxy, I am an illegal appropriator of objects that I do not own, although there are people who vulgarly call it thief. And this time I am involved in a very undesirable situation. The thing is that I took the Sprocket System landed, apparently one of the most secret treasures of the Drowhar army. But, as usual, these boys are not very happy and have decided to convert me into cosmic phosphate, something that wouldn't be so easy for them. I was contracted as a pilot by the Terra-1 confederation interstellar forces, although it wouldn't be bad at all if you could help me...
