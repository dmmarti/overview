Terra Fighter is a horizontal scrolling shoot-em-up viewed from above where you are the pilot of a spacecraft and you have to destroy an invading alien force to save your planet over six levels split into three stages. The first stage is based on the game Uridium where you have to fly over the surface of a planet or space-craft and blow up a certain amount of the scenery while avoiding and shooting waves of alien space craft who will shoot back at you. You can control the speed of your ship and the screen scrolls when you move as well as turn and fly the other way and you will need to turn if you reach the end of the level and you haven't destroyed enough of the scenery. There are various icons and they can affect your ship like destroy your ship or reverse the controls. The second stage is a simple shoot-em-up where you shoot or avoid waves of ships as you from move left to right with the screen scrolling constantly. You can't turn or control your speed. The final stage will see you face an end of level boss. Destroy the boss and it's of to the next level. Touching or being shot on any stage or level will see your power bar decrease and if it empties then you lose one of three lives. Lose all three and it's game over.
