Before the long-running Links series, Access Software produced the Leader Board lineage, which concludes here. Wind, snap and power are the main considerations as players dodge the bunkers, water and rough, which make for more complex courses than the 8-bit versions of the original. A course editor is included. The courses provided include real locations: St. Andrews (Scotland), Cypress Creek and Doral Country Club (USA) and a fictional one, The Gauntlet, which, as the name suggests, is designed to push the player's skills to the maximum. The PC version utilizes the PC speaker to reproduce voice samples via the company's patented RealSound process. Quips like No doubt about it, he's deep in the sandtrap, Straight onto the fairway, and Looks like he hit the tree, Jim are used to provide running commentary on the gameplay.
