The Paranoia Complex takes place in a city controlled by a rogue computer which has its dictatorial grasp over it. The player takes the role of a citizen who has the dirty job to hunt down terrorist rebels. This simply plays out that the computer gives instructions, the player walks to the terrorist in the top-down city and shoots him. After collecting a disk from the body and bringing it to a special terminal, money and promotions wait as reward. Money is essential because it is used to buy things like weapons, ammo or food. In regular intervals, the player has to take a personality test with yes/no answers and questions like Are you a fascist pig . Failing to answer correctly causes the player to become the hunted instead of the hunter.
