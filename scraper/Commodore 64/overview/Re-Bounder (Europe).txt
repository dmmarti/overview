Bounder is back! Again your in control of an tennis ball, that bounces and bounces and bounces... This time you must collect smart bombs to finish the game. You need to collect all of them: 16 smart bombs. Avoid bad stuff for landing like sand, spikes, traps or enemies. Unknown squares, signed with an  awaiting you: sometimes helpful (higher/longer jumps, extra-time and soon) - other times they're traps too. Excellent parallax-scrolling, nice graphics and sounds will give you a great time with this one, easy to play - but damn' hard to win!
