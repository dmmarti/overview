Tibo lives in the village of Choria, within the forest in Illussia. A mysterious disease has struck his father, a respected blacksmith. Not even Phobias the magician can cure him, but he does direct Tibo to some seasand on the beaches of Zabria on the far side of Illussia, which might work. Tibo's Tale is a side-view shooter played out on single screens containing Pang style bubbles, which must be shot down into smaller pieces enough times to eventually become so small as to disappear. Once they are all gone, a key is granted. Other foes such as snails, turtles and indian tribes occupy the screens and must be avoided. The journey includes six areas, including jungles, mushroom fields and fish-infested brooks. Three lives and an overall time limit are part of the challenge.
