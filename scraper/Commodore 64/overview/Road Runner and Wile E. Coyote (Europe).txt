The cartoons of Road Runner trying to flee Wile E. Coyote (and inevitably cause him to fall into a trap) are recreated in this action game. You control Road Runner himself in two distinct stages, each of which are repeated four times with increasing difficulty. In the first Road Runner must peck as much seed from the ground of a single screen as he can, while avoiding the myriad traps and dangers Wile E. Coyote throws at him from the sky. The more seed you can peck, the better your chances will be in take 2. This involves running away from Wile E, jumping the traps he has laid and finally reaching the safety of a big drop, which you will clear and watch Wile E. fall through, just like the cartoons.
