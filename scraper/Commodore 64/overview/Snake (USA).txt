The object of Snake Byte is to guide your snake to the apples that appear on the screen. Gobble up an apple, and another appears. Your snake also grows longer. Gobble up ten apples without hitting a wall or any part of your own ever-growing body, and a door to the next level opens. Thread your way through the door and you start over again, this time on a more complicated screen. As you move from level to level, the obstacles become more difficult. As you play, bars on each side of the display inch toward the top of the screen. Should they complete their journey before you've eaten an apple, you are penalized: Three more apples are added to the total you must eat before completing the level.
