Wallie P. Jones is in Rhymeland and is attempting to complete various tasks spreads over five levels based on famous rhymes. The rhymes the game is based on are Humpty Dumpty, Hey Diddle Diddle, Little Miss Muffet and The Owl and the Pussycat. Each level is split into two parts and sees Wallie first having to walk along the ground viewed from the side with the screen scrolling constantly from left to right split into 16 sections. There are various obstacles that need to be avoided or jumped and these are raindrops from a raincloud and pits full of fire. Jumping Jeff's and Grahamipoos need shooting with bubble gum from your mouth. When you reach the 16th section you move to the next part. The second part is a platform game with the whole part shown on the screen. You have to climb ladders to reach the top of the screen and get to an item or person which are Humpty, A Spoon, Curds and Whey, and a gold ring. The 5th level has you just reaching the end. There are various creatures and items that need avoiding but there are items that can be collected for bonus points. If you touch obstacles, creatures or fall from a height then you lose one of four lives and each part of the game has to be completed within a time limit. The joystick is used to control Wallie.
