You are the pilot of a spaceship and you have been tasked to protect your planets power rail from an alien invasion because if it is destroyed, so is your planet. The game is a horizontal side scrolling shooter with the screen scrolling to the left and the right when you move at various speeds controlled by the joystick. You are armed with a laser and a train follows you underneath on the track placing track bombs. There are 20 levels (you can start on the first nine) and to progress to the next level you have to shoot a certain amount of aliens bombing the track before the track is destroyed which is shown on a damage gauge on the screen. Hitting an alien ship or it's bullets decreases an energy counter and when it reaches zero you lose one of five lives. As well as the main playing area you can also see your score, hi-score, wave, energy, lives, alien ships to kill and the tracks damage gauge.
