The Helm of Immortality was stolen long ago by the evil Lich who keeps it in the bowlels of his castle, corrupt and incomplete. With the reward of retrieving The Helm to be immortal, many men have tried and all have failed. You are one such man determined to enter the castle and defeat Lich, but first you must explore the surrounding area to find objects to aid you as well as defeat many monsters and creatures along the way. The Helm is a text adventure with the screen having text describing your surroundings and you type in commands with the keyboard to interact with each location.
