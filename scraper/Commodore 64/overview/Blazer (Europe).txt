The Mazeli and Sahiban races don't like each other so they are at war. The problem is that the war has gone on for so long it's at a stalemate. To solve this problem, both races have started extensive research programmes to end this war. The Mazeli have found a solution, enter the 'Blazer' - a ship of enormous destructive power. The Sahiban are a bit scared so they decide that they should go and steal it. Problem is no Sahiban is brave enough to do this. Enter yourself, after an advert was placed for a brave being to attempt this suicide mission for 25 million galactic groats, you answered the call because you had nothing better to do. The game is a top down view, vertical shoot em up. You have 5 ships to complete your mission. The ship is so basic there are no power ups, just your simple forward shooting cannon. Enemies are varied and fly from either the top or sides of the screen. Bases on the surface can be shot as well. Go get it tiger, the Sahiban race are counting on you.
