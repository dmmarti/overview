Eureka! consists of a series of graphic adventure games set across various points in history. The game has you hunting for various pieces of an ancient talisman found on the Moon. The talisman was subjected to intense beams of the SHIVA Fusion Project lasers and the talisman shattered under the beams and each of its corners vanished. Three of the missing pieces were found several days later - one in Australia, one in Greenland, and the last in Outer Mongolia. However, the other five pieces are still missing. Noted physicist Dr. Abdul Majid discovers that each piece was catapulted in time and the five missing pieces have been traced to Prehistoric Europe, Roman Italy, Arthurian Britain, Wartime Germany, and the Modern Caribbean. Each adventure is preceded by a short arcade game in which you could increase your 'vigour' level for the forthcoming adventure section by collecting flashing objects scattered about the level and returning them to one's base. Your vigour level at any point in the adventure will determine whether not it is advisable to fight an opponent. Combat occurs frequently in every adventure. Sometimes you are attacked and must fight or run. At others you may initiate the combat, if you feel confident. Weapons or some form of protection will improve your chances of survival during each adventure.
