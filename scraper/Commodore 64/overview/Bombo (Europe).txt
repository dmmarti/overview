In Bombo, you must jump about the screen using the joystick or keyboard, gathering all the tokens. If you are touched by one of the moving enemies, you lose a life. You only have three lives and if you lose all of them, the game is over. If you gather the tokens in the order they are flashing, you receive a bonus. If you grab the falling power up, you can then grab the enemies for points, for a time.
