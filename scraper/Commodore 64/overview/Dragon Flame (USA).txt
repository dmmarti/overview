Set in between the SSI's AD andD Dragonlance action games Heroes of the Lance and Shadow Sorcerer. This game follows the tradition of Heroes of the Lance with a side-scrolling, action-oriented view, a breakaway from the standard GoldBox RPGs. Plot-wise, it also takes place between those two games, following closely the novel/game modules written by Weiss/Hickman. You take control of one character at a time, with each hero having different abilities.
