Tilt is a puzzle platform action, where the goal is to lead the ball through the maze from the entrance to the exit, collecting randomly appeared cans and avoiding obstacles such as magnets, red buttons, stop signs, holes and other traps to do not make your bonus low or to do not die. To provide the clear way for the ball, you should move the tiles of the maze in way of famous '15 puzzle' game. As time flows, the bonus size lowers, and you should perform your mission on each level as fast as possible. Several difficulty levels, speed of the ball, number of players (1-2) may be adjusted. The two-players mode is cooperative. The editor of the mazes are also present in Amiga and DOS versions.
