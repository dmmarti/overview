A young boy reads his favorite comic book about secret agent Steve Keene. The story begins when agent Keene's boss sends him on one of two missions: to Vienna to investigate the mysterious disappearance of a famous professor, or to solve the mystery of strange self-replicating non-functioning fire hydrants.

While reading from page to page like a comic magazine you can interact with the characters when you choose what Keene should do or say; sometimes you even can take control over Keene to surpass action sequences.
