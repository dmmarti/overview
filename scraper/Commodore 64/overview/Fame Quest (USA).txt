Fame Quest isn't a game about trying to become a rock or film star but being a lowly Knight in days of olde trying to get enough fame from the land to enter the Royal Court in this adventure game. You have to leave a castle and explore the land talking and helping the locals, as well as fighting wizards, dragons and creatures, in your quest to become a grade twenty Knight. The screen is split into five blocks, one at the top, three in the middle and one at the bottom which allows you to see various items and control your Knight. Block one shows you your available actions like interacting with your location or moving your Knight, block two shows the person or creature you are interacting with. Block three is a map of the area showing castles, houses, trees and mystery locations, block four shows your Knight and the amount of fame needed to increase your fame. Finally block five shows you how much gold and fame you have as well as weapons you are carrying. You start in a castle and here you have the options to ask for help, buy or improve weapons, get a new Knight grade, or sell any equipment you have. Once you have made your choices you can leave the castle and start exploring the land. You move north, south, east or west, and as you move around you will encounter various people or creatures. You can attack them, run away or talk to them but you need a weapon if you are attacking and you may not be able to run away sometimes. If you talk you may be given a quest, asked for a favour or just attack you. Some actions will lead to you receiving more fame but you can have some removed as well. Buildings entered can be empty or have a person or creature to interact with. Castles entered give you the same options as your starting castle and remember you have to have food and keep eating or you will get weak and die.
