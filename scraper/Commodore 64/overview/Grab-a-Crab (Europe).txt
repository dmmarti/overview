Grab-A-Crab is a top view single screen maze game inspired by the arcade game Pac-Man where you play the role of Hobbler the Gobbler who will eat anything. You have discovered a cavern with old turtle eggs and you plan to eat them all over various levels to fulfill your large appetite. As you eat the eggs around the maze, four crabs also move around the maze and have to be avoided or you lose one of three lives. There are four dodo eggs in each corner and if eaten allow you to eat the crabs for a short period of time. If you eat a lobster pot in the centre of the maze then you receive an extra dodo egg.
