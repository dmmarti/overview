The Torms and the invading Humans don't like each other. Spotting a quick buck you have decided to take both sides. The Torms have taken the Humans' farming robots who want them back. The Humans want the Torms' power plant to be destroyed forcing them up to the surface. Your aim is to rescue the robots and navigate the underground caverns to destroy the power plant. The game is viewed from the side as you move your ship about with the joystick. Gravity influences the ship and almost the entire environment is deadly to the touch, so regular upwards thrust (requiring fuel) and careful steering is required. The ship is armed with a cannon to take out mines and clear blocked passages. Attention must be paid to how many robots are picked up - too many means you crash. Some of the landing pads robots must be delivered to double as fuel stops.
