In L.A. Crackdown you play a cop staking out a warehouse to gather evidence in order to break up a drug ring. The action is controlled by monitors in a surveillance van. A rookie officer assists you by searching rooms, planting bugs, and even interrogating suspicious characters (watch out, he learns from experience and can help you make decisions or may disobey orders if he disagrees with a decision.)
