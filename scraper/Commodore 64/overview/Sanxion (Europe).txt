Sanxion is a side-scrolling shoot 'em up where you fight your way through wave after wave of colourful enemies, using a futuristic looking aeroplane. The screen is divided in two, with one third at the top of the screen showing a bird's eye panoramic view of the surroundings and your plane, and the two thirds at the bottom showing the actual battlefield. The scrolling speed is controlled by the player, as the scrolling slows down when the plane nears the left side of the screen, and picks up speed as the plane moves towards the middle. The game does not feature any end bosses or power-ups, instead the player is treated to a non-lethal bonus stage after each completed level, where the aim is to shoot, collect or avoid obstacles in a race against time.
