You are leading a mission to destroy Dr. Destructo's array of ships, and ultimately his island hideout, over 21 levels. You do this by flying a plane over a limited area, and shooting his planes so that they fall and inflict damage on the target item, which is large at the bottom of the screen. Multiple shots on a particular spot will ultimately cause a water-spout; three waterspouts and the ship (or island) will sink. Some enemy beings can be shot down, but others are indestructible and require evasive action. You are also armed with a bomb, which can be used to inflict precise damage once per level. One of the features of this game is that it uses a day/night cycle.
