Nerkus the Wizard has kidnapped Sherlie, and transformed her beloved Dave into an iron ball. As Dave, you must set off to rescue her from Nerkus' castle, by completing the zones that guard a magic door. Wonderball is a scrolling action game in which you control the constantly bouncing Dave, guiding him over water hazards and spikes, and away from contact with the many meanies he will encounter, such as Fireflies and Gugglies. Navigating a path through the chaos often requires pixel-perfect placement, particularly as enemies come into play based on your position in the level, rather than based on time. You start with 5 Daves. Entering the yellow Underground sections lets you play a simple game of chance, in which lives can be gained or points gained or lost.
