This is a drag racing simulator, named for Shirley Muldowney, a three-time world champion in the sport of Professional Top Fuel Dragsters. You go through the stages of qualifying and winning races. You select your equipment and learn to use it, then take it to the track and race in the qualifications. If you do well enough, you'll enter the races. Some attention was paid to the mechanics of driving the big cars. You need to be able to watch your tachometer and fuel gages and use a clutch.
