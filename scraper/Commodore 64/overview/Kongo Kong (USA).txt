Kongo Kong is a single screen platformer inspired by the arcade game Donkey Kong where you control a fireman trying to rescue a girl held hostage from an escaped Gorilla from the City Zoo over various levels. You have to run along platforms while climbing ladders to reach the Gorilla while avoiding various creatures and objects. The creatures take various forms and the objects include barrels and axes and if you touch one then you lose one of three lives. When you reach the girl then you move off the screen to the next level to try to rescue her again. There are also gaps of various sizes that can be jumped, but if too big then a moving rope can be grabbed to clear it. On later levels keys have to be collected to open doors.
