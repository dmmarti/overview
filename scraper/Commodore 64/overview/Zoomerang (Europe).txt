You are trapped in a castle belonging to Empress Min and you are now attempting to escape. The only problem is your body and mind have been separated and with your body in a green ball you must use your mind to get the ball out of the castle. You don't control the ball and can only watch it bounce around a room. To move the ball through 100 rooms in the castle you use a square cursor which turns triangles and squares to deflect the ball at various angles to reach entrances in each room. There are also baddies to contend with as well as some entrances requiring switches to be hit to allow an exit. There are Gems and energy that can be collected on the way.
