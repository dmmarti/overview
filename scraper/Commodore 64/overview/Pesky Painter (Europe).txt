Pesky Painter is a single screen game based on the arcade game Amidar where you play the role of Peter the Painter who has three tasks set by the King. The first screen has a grid made up of various rectangles and Peter has to move around the lines and clear the dots of dirt. Once a rectangle has no dots around it then the rectangle is filled but because Peter is known to be lazy then the King's guards move around the lines keeping an eye on Peter. If Peter is touched by a guard then he loses one of three lives but a press of the fire makes the guards jump but these are limited to three a life. If Peter paints the four corner rectangles then the guards can be chased and caught for bonus points for a short time. The second task is a bonus game where the King's pet has to be fed by picking the correct path from the top of the screen to some bananas at the bottom. The pet moves fast across various paths and a press of the button lets the pet move down a path. If the pet hits a horizontal path then it moves along before moving down the next vertical path. A bonus is awarded if the pet manages to reach the bananas. The final task now has Peter as a paint brush painting the paths around some more various sized rectangles with different points inside each one. Peter can only paint one rectangle at a time and if he goes past a rectangle being painted then the brush stops painting and a painted line has to be touched. Mice now move around the paths and once again if Peter touches them then he loses a life but he does have three jumps again. Once the tasks have been completed then the first screen is started again but with more enemies.
