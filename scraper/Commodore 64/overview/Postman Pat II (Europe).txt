Postman Pat's rounds for this morning take him through the streets to several different houses, all indicated by black arrows. Unfortunately, his van has broken down, so he must do his rounds on foot. The first job is to find a collect the pile of letters. Watch out for stray hens. Make sure to drink plenty of tea to ensure that he is up to the tasks. That is not all he must do though - being a pillar of the community he is always prepared to help out when his friends need a favour. These may involve collecting and using objects (only one can be carried at a time), or finding other people such as Ted Glenn the handyman. A top-down map guides you as you complete each task.
