Richard Petty's Talladega is a racing game where you get to take the super speedway as you race against king Richard Petty and 18 top pro drivers. After trying to qualify for a pole position, you use strategy to plan your pit stops, draft leading cars to pick up time and save fuel and be prepared for yellow caution flags.
