Your mission is to fly your spacecraft through tunnels in an underground cavern shooting 12 bulbs to move the next level. The game is viewed from the side and the screen scrolls left or right when you move your craft. As you search for the bulbs you must avoid or shoot various creatures and depending on the strength of your shield, if you touch one or hit the walls for too long then you lose one of three lives. Once you have shot all 12 bulbs then you move to the far left of the cavern to hit a switch and move to the next level. There are five levels to navigate with each cavern having the same layout but has more creatures to shoot or avoid. Before you start the game you can select the strength of your shield (1-5) and which level to start on. The joystick or keyboard can be used to control your craft.
