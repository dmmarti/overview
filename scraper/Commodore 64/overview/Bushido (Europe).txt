Bushido: Way of the Warrior is set in ancient Japan where two clans are in a feud. The player has the mission to infiltrate and conquer the other clan's fortress. Before starting the game, the player has to choose between different characters with different statistics in areas like strength, stealth or wisdom. The most important part of the game is exploring the maze-like castle and searching each room for items like keys or money. Many of those items need to be used in another place to proceed. Of course there are also guards which try to hinder the player's progress. Besides avoiding them or fighting them with martial arts, they also can be bribed. A magical belt transports the protagonist automatically back to the starting point when he is near death. Together with the save function this means there is no way of failing.
