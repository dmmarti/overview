Turbo 64 is a racing game which allows you and eight other friends to each race over a set number of laps each to get the highest score. There are two tracks to choose from, Loonies loop or Devils Deathtrack. Before the players drive you can select which gear shift to use (regular or auto) and how many laps (1-9). Each player now takes it in turns to drive round the track and complete the chosen number of laps. Your score gets higher the longer and faster you drive but straying too far off the track or hitting an obstacle on the side stops the car and stops your score from getting higher. The winner of the race is the player with the highest score. Turbo 64 is a 1st person perspective driving game where you use the joystick to control your car.
