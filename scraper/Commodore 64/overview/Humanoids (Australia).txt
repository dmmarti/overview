The year in 2850 AD. Captain Gryo is being held prisoner on the planet Vulso, and he must find a way to get to his Super Star Cruiser, which is blocked by a huge metal door. This door is opened by entering a four-letter password, but be able to reach it, Gyro needs to get through three environments while dealing with robots, comets, UFOs, aliens, and dragons blocking his way, shooting them with his laser beam to destroy them. From the second environment on, Gyro uses a different type of transport which includes a hover bike and a jet ski. Once he reaches the end of each environment, he is given clues as to what the password is. Once he has reached the metal door, he has a limited amount of time to enter the password or the whole planet explodes.
