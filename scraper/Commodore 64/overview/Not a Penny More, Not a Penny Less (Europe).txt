Jeffrey Archer: Not a Penny More, not a Penny Less - The Computer Game is an interactive fiction game based on Jeffrey Archer's novel Not a Penny More, not a Penny Less. The plot evolves around three Englishmen and one American who are swindled out of their savings. Now the four (the player takes the role of Stephen Bradley) try to swindle their money back from the original fraudster.nnnnThe game closely follows the plot of the book with a few puzzles thrown in. In comparison to other adventures the player generally can't use directional commands to change location; all puzzles have to be solved in a location before he is allowed to leave it. However, it is still possible to miss important objects and reach a dead end later. The game also gives no clues about the goals of a screen and expects the player to have read the book first (included with the game).nnnnThe puzzles are solved by typing in English commands, but the game only accepts precise commands. A speciality is the digitized speech (the amount depends on the platform) where Bradley comments on certain game situations.
