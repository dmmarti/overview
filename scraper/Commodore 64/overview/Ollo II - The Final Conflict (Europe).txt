Players control an UFO equipped with two types of weapons: laser shots that destroy any aircraft that approaches it, and bombs that can destroy land-based structures, which can include buildings and ground-based attacks. Players must destroy as many land-based structures as they can without losing a life. When they destroy enough of these, the player is advanced to the next stage. The game ends when all lives are lost.
