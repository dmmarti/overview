You are the pilot of an aircraft on a one man mission to destroy major enemy targets as well as destroy a number of installations. The game is viewed from a 3rd person perspective as you fly into the screen with the enemy sending planes and flak to stop you. You must fly as low as possible along the ground and destroy a set amount of installations and as you destroy these a gauge decreases. There are four types you must destroy and these include vehicles, radar stations and buildings. You can also fly to the top of the screen to destroy planes flying across the screen and if you touch a plane, installation or flak then you lose one of five lives. Once the set number of installations have been destroyed then you can attempt to destroy the main target by flying as low as possible across the ground again. You fly towards the target firing your bullets until it passes past you. You get four attempts to destroy it and if you fail then you have to destroy the installations again before trying to destroy the target. Destroy the target and you receive an extra life and it's onto the next set of installations and target to destroy.
