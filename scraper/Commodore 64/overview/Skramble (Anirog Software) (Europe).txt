Skramble is a version of the classic arcade shooter Scramble which has you controlling a ship over seven levels, over a horizontal side scrolling landscape. You have to blast and bomb aliens and objects with your laser and bombs and as you fly, missiles will take off from the ground and fly upwards so they need to be shot or avoided. Touch the surface, objects or a bullet then you lose one of three lives. As you fly and blast, your fuel gauge decreases so scattered around the levels are fuel dumps and these need destroying to increase your gauge. Run out of fuel and it's a life lost.
