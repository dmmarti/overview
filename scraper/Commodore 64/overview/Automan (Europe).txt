This is the game based on the 80's TV series of the same name. Automan is a Tron style computer generated super-sleuth who has a glowing cursor to produce cars and 'coptors. An evil Automan clone has been created by an underworld crime organisation using the same program as Automan. It won't be for doing good though. Automan needs to find objects and evidence to track his clone down and destroy him. Be careful though, there are many objects waiting to kill him. When he has collected the evidence and objects he can drive to the next location. The game is a flick screen platform game. To get to some parts of a screen you have to go onto another one to come back on yourself. The bottom info bar tells you your location, score and how many objects and evidence you have collected. The driving sections are a 3D maze style game.
