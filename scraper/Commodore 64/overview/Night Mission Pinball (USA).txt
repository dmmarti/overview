Night Mission Pinball is a pinball game simulation. You can change many physical parameters of the machine to suit your playing style or your whim such as the number of balls, ball speed, the incline of the machine, the kick off the bumpers, etc. It supports 1-4 players and is controlled by the keyboard or joystick. The Atari 8-bit version made use of the keyboard click speaker for sound-effects.
