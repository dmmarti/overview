International Hockey is the sequel to Artworx's SLAP-SHOT! Hockey. The game features standard single player vs computer (3 skill levels) and 2 player head-to-head modes. Controls offer precision passing, bone crushing body checks, with penalty shots and a shootout mode. Make use of the walls on the arena to advance the puck. The player closest to the puck is under your control; others appear ghosted-out. Digitized speech, crowd noise and an organist add to the feel of the experience.
