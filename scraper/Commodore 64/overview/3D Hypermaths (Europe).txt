3D Hypermaths is an educational action game that teaches children, 8 years and older, maths with a selection of addition, subtraction, multiplication and division, with various levels of difficulty. The child controls a spacecraft, moving left or right, looking behind it which is flying into the screen down a tunnel to escape a Black Hole over various levels. The child must give the answer to a maths problem and if the correct answer is given then they receive a letter making up the word HYPER, but if the wrong answer is given then they lose part of their shield which is made up of ten parts. As they answer the questions, meteors fly through the tunnel towards the spacecraft and these must be avoided or part of the shield is lost when hit and when the shield is empty then it is game over. Once the word HYPER is made and an extra problem solved then the child can attempt a HyperJump which sees two coloured walls with a gap in between, move to the left and right. The child must keep the spacecraft in the gap without touching the wall or parts of the shield is lost once again. Once the HyperJump is completed then the next level is played with some lost parts of the shield received.
