This game is one of Paul Norman's first creations. You are in the middle of what is called the Forbidden Forest. You must defend yourself from the various enemy creatures that are in the forest with your bow and arrows. At the end of the game, you are fighting the mysterious Demogorgon, which appears when nighttime falls. Choose from four different levels of difficulty. Forbidden Forest was one of the earliest games to feature an environment which changes from day to night, parallax scrolling and gory effects.
