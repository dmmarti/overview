Plop is a single-screen side-view game where you have to bomb man-eating plants in a World War II plane as the gardener for Sir Hubert 'two-little-ducks' Flog. Sir Hubert (celebrated botanist and part-time bingo caller) brought the seeds of the plants from the dark continent and after being planted and tended by yourself, the plants have eaten Sir Hubert, next doors cat, a lawn mower and the entire contents of 64 Dame Edna Everage Avenue in London. The only solution is to fly over the plants in the plane and bomb them all until they have gone. You first appear in the plane from the top left of the screen moving to the right with the plants of various heights at the bottom of the screen. When you reach the right side of the screen you then appear from the left one place lower. Pressing the space bar releases a bomb and removes some of the plant it hits but you can't release another bomb until the other bomb has removed some of a plant. It is game over once the plants are removed or you hit a plant.
