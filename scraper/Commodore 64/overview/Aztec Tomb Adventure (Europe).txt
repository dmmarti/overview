Aztec Tomb Adventure is a single player text adventure with graphics. The player takes the role of an explorer who sets out through the Amazon jungle to find the location of an Aztec tomb. While there are locations to explore they are not in the tomb itself, locating the tomb ends the game. The game has a standard parser that allows the entry of two word commands and is entirely keyboard driven.
