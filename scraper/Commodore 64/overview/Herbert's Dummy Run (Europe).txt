Herbert's Dummy Run is the 4th game out of five in the Wally Week series (Automania, Pyjamarama, Everyone's a Wally and Three Weeks in Paradise) and sees baby Herbert lost in a department store trying to find his parents Wally and Wilma in the Lost and Found before the end of the day. As in previous games Herbert's Dummy Run is an arcade adventure where you must pick up objects and place them in the right locations. You are only able to carry two objects at a time and some objects are needed to be found to help complete the various arcade sequences. Nasties need to be avoided as well and if touched part of your tear gauge is filled. If your tear gauge is filled then one of three lives are lost. Lose all three lives or run out of time then it is game over.
