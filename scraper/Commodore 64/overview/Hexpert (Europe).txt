Hexpert is a single screen game, with an isometric view, based on the arcade game Q*Bert where you control Bert trapped on a pyramid by the evil witch Zoganaar. Over various levels, Bert has to turn every hexagon on the pyramid from one colour to the other by landing on them to move to the next level. Also on the pyramid are bouncing balls and a snake which follows Bert and these have to be avoided or you lose one of five lives. Two spinning discs either side of the pyramid when jumped on move Bert to the top of the pyramid and can make the snake jump off the pyramid for a short time. If Bert jumps of the pyramid then it is game over.
