Dr. Xavier Tortion (aka Dr. X), jewel thief and smuggler extraordinaire, is on the loose; intelligence reports he is somewhere in North America along with numerous jewels he's stolen. Your job will be to find the jewels and locate Dr. X! Adventures in North America is an educational adventure game which is similar to the Carmen Sandiego series of games. In the game you will need to travel to various North American locations to search for clues; some clues have been left behind by friendly agents and indicate where jewels are located. Sometimes you will come across an informant; if bribed with money or jewels, you will receive a clue as to Dr. X's where about. When you think you have enough clues, you can guess where Dr. X is hiding; you only get three guesses though, so if you keep guessing wrong the game will end. If you are successful in your mission, you are given an efficiency rating; the fewer turns you can locate Dr. X in and the more jewels recovered, the better your score will be.
