Pot Panic is a puzzle game resembling a simpler version of Klax. You are the pot washer at a large restaurant. As the restaurant is extremely busy at the moment, the pots have a tendency to keep tumbling down. You have to stack the pots so that five pots of each respective type are stacked one on top of the other. As soon as you have managed this, the pots will immediately disappear and you will have space for new ones.
