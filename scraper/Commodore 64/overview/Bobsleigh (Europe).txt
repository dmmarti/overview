Ever wanted to go to the Winter Olympics If you've always wanted to operate a bobsleigh team and even participate in the races, then this is the game for you. The game starts off with the management side of things including training the team, buying equipment, and keeping those finances from the red. If you go bankrupt then it's game over. Going bankrupt can happen from spending too much money, crashing, or poor finishes. When you start the race or season then it's time to start racing. The game is viewed from inside the bob behind the driver and brakeman. You steer the bob left and right (gravity controls the speed) as you watch the track hurtling towards you. You can see your speed and times as well. Do well and you receive more money. This can go towards more training and better equipment. Good luck for the season and hopefully you can get to the Olympics. Your gonna need all the luck in the world.
