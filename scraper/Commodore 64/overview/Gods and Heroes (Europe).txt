In this follow up to Hercules, you once again play Hercules who must traverse over 50 single screens in this platform game. On each screen is an item that needs collecting to move to the next screen and you must navigate the platforms avoiding various creatures who when touched lose one of three lives. Springs can be used to jump higher and there are hidden platforms that will only appear when jumped on as well as some platforms that can't be touched. Before you start you can select the game speed (1-8) and the actual start level (1-50). A joystick is used to control Hercules.
