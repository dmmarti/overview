As with most Melbourne House adventures, Terrormolinos has a real-world setting. You play a family man taking his wife and kids on a holiday they will never forget, for all the wrong reasons. Avoid the bulls and sharks, take care to avoid heatstroke, and make sure your family doesn't run off. Getting there and simply surviving all the hazards the brochure 'forgot' to mention is a challenge in itself, but you must also take 10 holiday snaps to prove what you got up to. Your film only allows 12 shots to be taken, so only 2 mistakes are allowed when choosing to take a photo you consider significant. The game is structured similarly to a real holiday. There are day trips to go on, which provide extra photo opportunities. A few Spanish phrases such as 'QUE QUIRE USTED' ('what do you want ') and 'UNA HABITACION' ('a room') are included; the manual details these. The parser is primarily VERB NOUN.
