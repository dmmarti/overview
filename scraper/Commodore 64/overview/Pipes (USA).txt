Pipes is an educational game for children. Your mission is to figure out the shortest, most economical way to get the neighborhood hooked up to the water supply system. Decide what kind of pipe to buy and where to put it. Remember that your budget is limited so you don't have much margin for errors. You can choose the amount of houses you try to hook up to the system from 1 (easiest) to 5 (hardest).
