Ghouls is a single screen platform game where you have to control a creature and retrieve the power jewels taken by ghosts and stored in a haunted mansion. Starting on the bottom of the screen, you have to jump up and walk on platforms to get to your power jewels on the top of the screen. Some of the jewels have come loose and you can collect them as you move around the screen. Also on the screen are ghosts, spiders and various obstacles like spikes and moving platforms and if you touch a ghost, spike or fall from a certain height then you lose one of four lives. You can collect a special jewel which makes the ghosts disappear for a few seconds and springs allow you to jump higher. A timer counts down and a level must be completed within the time or you lose a life.
