You are a General Agricultural Robot Functionary (G.A.R.F.), and in this side view single screen game you have to grow six Aquaronum Upshootus while avoiding and shooting various creatures trying to kill you over various levels. To water the plants you have to fill up with water from a tap on the left of the screen shown by a gauge on the top of the screen, and water each plant which will shoot up into the air before flowering. When the gauge empties then you have to return back to the tap to fill up. The creatures trying to kill you move around the screen in various directions like Mutant Camels and Galaxians and shoot at you. You can shoot back with JM84 Pesticide which will kill the creatures when hit and if you are hit or touch a creature then an energy gauge decreases and when it empties then you lose one of seven lives. As well as moving left or right on the ground, you can fly in the air but you cannot water the plants but flying decreases your energy and when it is empty you fall back to the ground. Staying on the ground also increases your energy gauge and you must complete the level within a time limit. Once all six plants have flowered then you move to the next level and you can select any of the first 32 levels by pressing the correct key on the keyboard.
