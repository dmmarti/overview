The player's character is locked in an infernal house full of deadly traps. He must escape by collecting all the keys and by opening all the chests that are spread throughout the rooms. He must also find food in order to survive. The game features non-linear gameplay (you can go back and forth in the house while you explore it) along with very visual depictions of the many different ways the player can die.
