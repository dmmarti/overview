Rallycross racing was once popular on the BBC, featuring super-modified cars racing against each other on tracks combining tarmac and gravel sections. Rally Cross Challenge sees Anco bring it to life in top-view Super Sprint style. There are six different circuits, and four cars in the game - 16-bit users with a Microdeal joystick adapter can have all four of these controlled by human players, other users are limited to 2-player. Computer cars have varying personalities and abilities. You must finish in the top 3 to move on to the next race. The opportunity to upgrade your car comes after each race, with the points you earn from race results (4,2,1 for the top 3). There are six categories of upgrades - turbo, steering, traction, aerodynamics, repair time and brakes.
