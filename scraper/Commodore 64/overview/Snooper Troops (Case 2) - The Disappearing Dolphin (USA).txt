The 2nd and final in the series of detective/problem solving games for kids. Armed with your Snoop-mobile, the snoopNET computer, a wrist-radio, flashlight and pen and paper, you're the detective who must solve the case of Lilly, the missing dolphin. The game requires logical thinking, planning, and note taking as you slowly comb the neighborhood gathering clues and evidence. Once the suspect is properly identified, use the snoopNET computer to accuse and ensure that justice has been served.
