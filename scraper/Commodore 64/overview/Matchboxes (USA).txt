Matchboxes is a combination of a memory/concentration game and a word guessing game. The game is played by two players (the second can be AI or another human) on a grid containing 36 boxes. Upon flipping a box an animated figure is revealed and the aim is to get pairs of the same kind and colour. The player will then get to keep uncovering boxes until a match isn't made. Beneath the grid is a word which is partially revealed as boxes are opened and after every match the player gets a chance to enter the word. The player that first enters the right word wins the game. There are some different variations of the game: one that lacks the word guessing part, one with reversed words and one where the word is scrambled.
