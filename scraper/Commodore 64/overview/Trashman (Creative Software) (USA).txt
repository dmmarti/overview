This is a Pacman-style maze game in which you control a garbage truck and try to collect all the trash pieces and bring them to the city dump. Collect all the trash pieces to advance to the next level. While collecting the trash pieces you must avoid the enemies, which kind of look like birds, maybe like you would find at the dump. There are 6 'trash can' power ups per level that allow you to catch the enemies for more points. (Just like how eating a power pill will allow you to eat the ghosts in Pacman). The game maze features wrap-arounds both at the sides and top to bottom.
