BMX Simulator 2 is a sequel to the game BMX Simulator. It still looks and plays like the first game but instead of two riders racing there are now four. Also instead of just one terrain there is now two, Dirt and Quarry. Dirt racing is still the same as the first game but Quarry racing is classed as expert and you can choose the thickness of your tyres and the chain wheel size. The game is still viewed from above and the joystick steers your rider while the fire button speeds up and slows down the rider.
