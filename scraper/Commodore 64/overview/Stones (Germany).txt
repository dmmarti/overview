Riddles and Stones is a puzzle game where you look down on a grid made up of blocks that are either a wall, a floor tile with a symbol, or a block which generates sliding blocks with symbols matching the floor tiles. The object is to slide the tiles in the correct order to make a path through the grid from one arrow to the other arrow. Once a block is created it will only stay on a square with the same symbol and the blocks won't stop sliding until it hits something. The game is controlled by a joystick.
