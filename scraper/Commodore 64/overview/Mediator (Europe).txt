Find the time crystal... Neutralize the Doomsday Machine.nn 8 Challenging, exciting scenarios. nnnnEight separate scenarios with smooth scrolling screens, fast action and plenty of excitement. nnnnLong ago, eons past, a doomsday machine was placed in high orbit above the satellites Xylos and Pholos. It's role: to deter further acts of nuclear war between empires of the galaxy. Should critical levels of nuclear activity be detected emanating from the surface of the satellites, the machine will activate and destroy both civilizations. nnnnMarauding invaders, from the Zagos Galaxy, unaware of the danger from the doomsday machine, launch a nuclear attack against Pholos. Xylos then launches a counter-offensive with hypnobeams against the Zags, slowing down the critical build-up of nuclear radiation. nnnnYour mission: As the saviour of the galaxy, you must locate the legendary Good Mediator to acquire the mythical Time Crystal, which endows the possessor with the power to psychokinetically dispatch any destructive elements to another time zone.
