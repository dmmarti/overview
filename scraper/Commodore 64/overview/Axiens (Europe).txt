Axiens is a version of Galaxians where you control a ship at the bottom of the screen trying to shoot all the aliens moving across the top of the screen and firing at you. Occasionally one will swoop down zig-zagging and shooting. When all aliens are shot then they appear once more moving faster, shooting more and more aliens swooping down. The joystick is used to control your ship.
