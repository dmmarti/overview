Paddington's Garden Game is a game based on the character from the books by Michael Bond, where you play Paddington Bear who is spending a week in the country and has decided to catch butterflies. The game is a flick-screen maze game viewed from above at an elevated angle and is aimed at children between the ages of five to eight. You move around the countryside looking for different coloured butterflies, each with a unique name which are Wilbur, Geoff, Boswold, Cyril and Mandy and are worth different points. To catch a butterfly you only have to touch it and you automatically use your net to capture it. Also on the various screens are hedgehogs and wasps which move around and these must be avoided or you lose one of three lives. The walls of flowers and other obstacles should also be avoided as you also lose a life when touched. As well as a your score you are also trying to complete the game as fast as you can which is saved as well as the score. Once you lose all three lives then it is game over but you do watch the butterflies being released back into the wild.
