Go Racing With Peter O'Sullevan allows yourself and seven other players to bet and make money on various horse races on various race courses. Each player starts with ï¾£1000 and they can see each horse, their form, trainer and jockey, and their last three races before deciding which horses to bet on. Each player can bet on as many horses as they want and they can bet to win or each-way as well. The race itself is shown form the side at a slight elevated angle and the screen scrolls from right to left with the lead horses. After the race the result is shown and money won / lost for each player before the next race is shown and the betting starts once again.
