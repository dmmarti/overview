From the days of fighting sail comes this game of combat on the high seas. Although produced very early in the PC era (1988), Ralph Bosson's High Seas works from a graphical deck view, resorting to a chart view only for position checks (which can become important in fleet engagements). It operates either on 10-game-minute turns, or interrupt-to-issue-orders mode. It models the effects of wind on maneuvering and the effects of different ammo types against the wooden walls and sails of opposing vessels. A very advanced feature included is a scenario designer. The game can be played either hot-seated or with a computer opponent.
