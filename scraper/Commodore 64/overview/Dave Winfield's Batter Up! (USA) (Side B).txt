Dave Winfield's Batter Up! is an educational baseball game which was developed in conjunction with professional baseballer Dave Winfield. The program contains two parts, a tutorial called lessons with Dave Winfield and a game called Slugfest. The tutorial consists of five lessons teaching the techniques of the game: the grip, the stance, the pitch, the swing and hitting strategies. Included in the package is also a book called The Act of Hitting which expands on the lessons in the program. The game, Slugfest, is exclusively about batting and the player can play alone or compete against up to three other players. The player hits against a series of eight pitchers each with a different style. Before starting one can choose stance to swing from, hitting left or right and which field to play on. Once out on the field the batter and the pitcher are viewed from a fixed third person perspective. As the ball is thrown the player has to press the right height key (high, medium or low) just as the ball passes by. Upon a hit a map will show the flight path of the ball and the result (single, foul ball, home run etc.) will be reported.
