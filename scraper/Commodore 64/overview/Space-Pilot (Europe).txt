Space Pilot is a clone of the classic Konami game Time Pilot and was developed independently from the contemporary BBC Micro game of the same name with similar gameplay. Players command an aircraft through different environments, shooting down planes to collect points. The ship's nose can be rotated left or right, so the craft can move into any direction and take sharp turns left or right. Speed is not controlled by the user and it is always maintained at the same level automatically. The background is wrapped endlessly both horizontally and vertically, and that way it is impossible to encounter a border. The game takes place in five time periods: 1919, 1940, 1970, 1984 and 2001. Each level holds different types of enemies. In each scene the player needs to shoot down enemy planes to deplete a time meter on the right side of the screen. The planes appear in squadrons and they shoot regular bullets or drop bombs. After an entire squadron is taken out, a new one appears until the time meter is completely empty. At that moment a larger enemy appears and when that one is shot down the player's plane warps to a new time period. Later levels introduce enemies such as helicopters and UFOs. The player starts with three lives. A bonus pilot is provided at 20,000 points and then at every 60,000 points. Points are gathered by shooting down planes and rescuing paratroopers. The game supports two players, taking turns.
