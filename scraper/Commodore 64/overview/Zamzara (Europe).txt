Zamzara is a side-scrolling platform shooter in which the player controls an alien of the same name. The object of the game is to escape from a laboratory before a bomb explodes. You have little time to trek through the lab to finally get to your ship, which you need to leave the complex. Along the way you'll encounter a bunch of nasty aliens and monsters which you will need to kill with your large arsenal of weapons. You are armed with fire weapons such a laser gun and rocket launcher.
