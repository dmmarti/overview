Rather than creating a pure arcade game, Five Ways aimed at creating a true simulation of rallying that also had educational value. As such, a full map of the area is provided, a degree of route-planning is required, with each road having its own properties. Some have a higher possible speed, some are more likely to flood when it rains, and some are prone to being closed. You can get information on current conditions (and avoid a 50-second penalty) by stopping at a checkpoint. The hazards featured in the game are unusual - spectators running onto the track and stray farm animals must be avoided, and a definite penalty is imposed for driving the wrong way down a road. The race is in three stages, and drivers are eliminated after each of the first 2.
