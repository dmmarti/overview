Cosmic Capers is a text adventure where your mission is, well that's the thing, starting in an English village you actually have no idea what your goal is. As you explore the village and surrounding areas, with your computer companion Bugsy, you discover spacecrafts in the area. As you progress you will have trips into space, find out objects to collect and use elsewhere, but above all you need to stay alive. Text on the screen describes your location and you type in commands with the keyboard to interact with your surroundings.
