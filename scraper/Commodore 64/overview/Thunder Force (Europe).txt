You and a friend play fighters who must run down a corridor to the right over various levels punching bad guys who appear from the left or the right of the screen. Near the end of the level a big baddie appears who need to be destroyed to carry on your mission. A gun can also be collected to help you on your way. If you are touched then your energy decreases but increases slowly as you carry on. Thunder Force is a beat-em-up viewed from the side. The joystick moves your fighter, jumps and ducks while the fire button punches or shoots your gun. In the two player game both fighters are on the screen. As well as the main playing area you can see your score, energy and lives.
