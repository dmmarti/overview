Sat in your office doing your humdrum job, you receive a phone call that makes you blackout and you end up in a prison cell. A revolutionary group have managed to get their hands on a powerful computer controlled device that will enable them to control the minds of the world's population. Your mental ability though has made you immune to the device so you have been labelled an enemy to their cause and thrown into jail. Your mission now is to escape your prison cell, locate the device and save mankind from being controlled. Mindbender is a text adventure where the screen has text describing your location and you type in commands with the keyboard to interact with your surroundings.
