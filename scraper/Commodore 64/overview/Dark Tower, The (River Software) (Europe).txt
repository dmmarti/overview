Prince Harry has been turned into a mutant by the guardian of the Dark Tower, and must get all of the gems in the tower's 28 locations to be transformed back to his human self. Once Harry has collected the gems in each location, secret letters are revealed. These letters are used to solve a puzzle when Harry gets to the end. Each location in the tower has more than one exit, making it possible for Harry to explore the tower without conquering every location. There are hazards in each location that Harry must watch out for. Apart from creatures that roam around - which Harry can jump over there are chasms that can be swung over with the use of ropes, falling daggers that blocks Harry's way back, and slopes that he cannot walk back up.
