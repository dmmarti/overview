Frogger 64 is a clone of the classic game Frogger. The player takes control of a frog and must move the frog from the bottom of the screen to the top avoiding obstacles along the way. A busy street and a river must be crossed by evading cars and jumping onto logs and turtles. Bonus points are scored by hopping onto lady frogs and flies. The player has 3 lives but a bonus life is given when a score of 10,000 points is achieved. The object of the game is to set a high score. It can be played with a joystick or with the keyboard.
