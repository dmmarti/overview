Pixie Pete is a single screen game viewed from the side inspired by the arcade game Dig Dug where you control Pete as he digs around the screen to collect all the carrots over various levels. As you dig you leave behind tunnels and moving through the tunnels is Desmond the Dragon who can be avoided or killed but Desmond cannot dig through the dirt. To kill Desmond you use your pump which when extended can touch Desmond and pressing the fire button pumps him full of air till he explodes. There are other Dragons on screen and these can be killed for extra points. Once Desmond is killed then he appears as Gorgo the Ghost and can move anywhere on the screen but can be killed the same way as Desmond. If you touch Desmond, a Dragon or Gorgo then you lose one of three lives. Once all the carrots have been collected then you move to the next level and before you start the game you can select the starting level (1-15).
