Flippit is a puzzle game where the player has to swap the colour of squares so the grid being played on matches the grid on the bottom right corner. When the player clicks on a square with the joystick it swaps colour and other squares round it. There are over a 100 levels to complete. Other things the player can see on the screen are how many moves he or she has taken and the timer. There is no time limit, but the faster and the fewer moves the player completes a grid with, the better the high-score.
