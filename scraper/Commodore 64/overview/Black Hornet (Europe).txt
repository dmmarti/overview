You pilot the Black Hornet, an advanced stealth fighter that can nip in and out without any sound to destroy any enemy. Once again the world is under threat from a madman so it's decided to send in you with the Black Hornet. You will encounter various enemies and ground installations who are hell bent to destroy you. As well as destroying these, buildings and various vehicles can be destroyed as well. Desert, valleys and mountains, sea and space will need to be flown through to complete your mission. Black Hornet is a vertically scrolling shoot-em-up viewed from above. The joystick is used to control your plane while the fire button fires one of various weapons. To select a weapon you press the space bar. You need also to keep an eye on your fuel gauge which slowly empties the further you progress. Along the way you will see an airfield or an aircraft carrier. Pressing forward and fire on the edge of these will allow you to land on them. Be careful though because the enemy can still hurt you. Here you can buy more weapons and even re-fuel. These items cost you points so make sure you blast every thing in sight to boost your score. As well as the main playing area you can also see your lives, score, damage gauge, fuel gauge and weapon selected.
