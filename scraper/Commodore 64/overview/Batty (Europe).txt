The Commodore 64 version of Arkanoid variant Batty has no fewer than 64 levels, compared to 14 on the other versions. Basic game features are otherwise the same, with a 2 player mode in which players have access to half the screen each. Power ups include faster bat control, a larger bat and multiball. Unusual features for the style include magnets affecting the ball's motion, and enemies dropping bombs which must be avoided.
