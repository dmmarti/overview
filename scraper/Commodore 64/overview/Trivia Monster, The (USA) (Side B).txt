Monster trivia is a trivia game for up to four players. Match wits with up the 3 opponents as you attempt to answer over 2000 trivia questions in six categories (show-bizz, sports, science, history, the arts, grab bag) to determine who gets to have lunch with the Monster. Unlike some other trivia games from that period of time, you have to type in your answers to the exact letter. If you're wrong, the Trivia Monster screams bloodcurdlingly or tries to break the door separating you from your lunch date.
