For reasons unknown, you have been sent to the city of Zyto to destroy it. To help you in your quest you have a truck carrying a rocket which you use to traverse the six levels of the city. To destroy the city you have to collect six pieces of a bomb to place on the lowest level which destroys the outer defences allowing you to shoot the inner defences. Your truck can travel over various rough terrains but some obstacles like gaps in the ground or water require blocks to be placed to allow you carry on moving. Here you can send the rocket to find and collect the blocks to place in your path. The rocket though has limited fuel and ammunition. A parachute is also needed to be found to allow the truck to drop through the holes to the next level of the city. To protect the city, the inhabitants have sent out various vehicles to destroy you as well as electrical discharges which need turning off by a control panel. Zyto is viewed from the side and the game scrolls as you move from left to right. As well as the main playing area you can also see your fuel and ammo gauges, score, time and how many bomb pieces you are carrying. The joystick is used to control the truck and rocket.
