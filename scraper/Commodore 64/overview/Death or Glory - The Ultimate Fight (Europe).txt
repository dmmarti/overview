New Stratford is under attack from a huge fleet of alien craft, and it is your job to shoot them down and save your planet. You fly around a top-view arrangement, flying into enemy craft in the hope of destroying them. You must use the fire button to destroy the mothership bases which appear in each section. Controls work on a rotational basis, and you have limited fuel.
