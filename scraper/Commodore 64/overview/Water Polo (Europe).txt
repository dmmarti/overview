Water Polo is based on the team water sport. It has four modes: Demo, 1-player, 2-player, and Championship. The game presents a playing field in a 3-D style with the goals to the left and right sides. The game scrolls across the play field with the ball as the play field is about two screens wide. Each team has 6 players as in a real game of water polo. The player controls whichever player has or is closest to the ball.
