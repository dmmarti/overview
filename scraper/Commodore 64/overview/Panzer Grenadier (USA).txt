You will also be given elements of a panzer regiment and an artillery battalion. Your forces include mortars, artillery, Panzer IV, Panther and Tiger Tanks. There are five historical scenarios provided with three levels of difficulty. One of four levels of victory attained is determined after every turn and at the end of the game.
