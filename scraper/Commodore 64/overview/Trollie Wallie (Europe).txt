You are shopping at your local supermarket where you have to buy 40 items from your list. Problem is shopping here is dangerous with creatures roaming and obstacles in your way. You can lose one of your four lives by touching a creature, falling from a height or touching certain obstacles. Another problem you have is that you can only carry five items at a time, once you have five you must go back to the start to pay for them and store them. Switches also need to be find to make certain walls that are blocking your path disappear. Trollie Wallie is a platform game that scrolls when you move in all directions with a small part of the supermarket shown on screen. As well as the main playing area, you can also see your score, lives, items on your person, total items and a bonus clock that counts down from 1000.
