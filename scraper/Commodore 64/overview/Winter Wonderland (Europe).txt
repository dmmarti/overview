After studying and working as a Anthropologist for ten years you finally have the chance to make a huge discovery to put your name in the history books. Your Soviet friend Sergio has discovered a lost civilisation in the Himalayas, Tibet and has asked you to come to get your advice. After landing at the airport in Tibet and you being a qualified pilot, you hire a plane to fly near the site of the lost civilisation. The weather in the Himalayas can change so quickly and you find yourself flying in a snow storm pushing you higher until your engine is unable to cope and stalls. Noticing a huge snowfield below you decide to land there and try to walk the rest of the way on foot, if you survive the landing. The plane crashes but you escape the crash unscathed. Lost and alone in freezing temperatures you must try to survive and find your friend Sergio. Winter Wonderland is a graphic text adventure where as well as text describing your location you can also see a drawing of the location as well. You use the keyboard to type in your commands.
