Miss Mind II: Ania is a puzzle-board game. The player's task is to guess the sequence of five digits in six attempts. At the top of the screen the player indicates digits from 0 to 9. The results of the trials are shown on the top right side of the screen: full dot (C64 - hearts) is a perfect match, half full dot (C64 - question mark) means that the digit occurs in a different place.
