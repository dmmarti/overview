The land of Ymros was first encountered in Shard of Spring, and it returns in this follow up, which is viewed from above, but has a game-world 32 times the size of its predecessor. Your characters can include Humans, Elves, Dwarves and Trolls, each with different skills as well as generated and varying statistics, and one of 10 different character classes - Barbarian, Wizard and Scholar for Example. You will need to choose the right balance of these for your mission, which involves tracking down Malifon and gain revenge on the damage he has done to Ymros. Combat takes place via close-quarters combat and spell-casting, depending on the character's abilities. Towns can be visited to buy weapons, and you can return to your camp to worship one of the various Gods and receive their gifts such as resurrection and protection. It has also a 'skill/item' menu in which items can be used on other items to solve problems.
