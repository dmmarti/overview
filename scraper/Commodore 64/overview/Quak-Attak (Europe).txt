Quak Attak is a side-view single screen game inspired by the arcade game Joust where you have to defeat three of your foes on various levels. Riding on your Osturkey and armed with your Laser-Lance, you must unseat your foes from their flying steads before shooting them on the ground. To unseat a foe your lance must be higher than theirs when you ride into them making them parachute to the ground. They will then run to the side of the screen by foot and you can shoot them for bonus points but you lose fifty points if they escape. If you are hit by a foe then you are unseated and you lose one of three lives. Occasionally a dragon flies across the screen and cannot be shot or touched or it is a loss of life.
