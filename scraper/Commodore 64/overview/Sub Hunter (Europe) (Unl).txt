Hunter is a top view single screen shooter where you control a spacecraft and you must move between the rectangles of a 6 x 5 grid trying to destroy all the Roboships on the screen with your missiles. The Roboships will attempt to crash into you but will try to avoid any missiles that you launch in a straight line and if you are hit then you lose one of five lives. Any missile launched that doesn't hit a Roboship loses you points. Once all the Roboships are destroyed then you move to the next screen where the enemy are faster.
