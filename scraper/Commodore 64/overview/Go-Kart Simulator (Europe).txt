Go-Kart Simulator is a top down multi-scrolling driving game where you control a go-kart and drive around a maze picking up all the bonuses on each level to progress to the next one. As you drive around looking for the bonuses, you will encounter other drivers and these must be avoided or you lose one of three lives. Your go-kart is equipped with a limited number of smoke-bombs which delays the other drivers for a limited time, and more bombs can be found around the maze. Also on screen is a radar showing all the bonuses, bombs and other drivers and each level has to be completed within a time limit.
