Match Day is a football game that allows you play a match against the computer, against a friend or with seven friends in a cup competition. Other options available before you play is the length of a half (5, 15 or 45mins), the computer level (Amateur, Professional or International) and changing the team names. Once you have selected your options and type of game it's on to the match. The game is viewed from the side at an elevated angle with part of the pitch shown and the screen scrolls when the player with the ball moves. A joystick or keyboard is used to control your players and the main football rules apply. You can dribble with the ball, pass it or shoot, and you control the player nearest to the ball. When the ball appears near your goal you can also control the keeper. Throw-ins, goal kicks and corners are also used.
