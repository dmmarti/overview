The Shadows of Mordor is an officially licensed J.R.R. Tolkien Lord of the Rings text adventure game based on the second part of the trilogy - The Two Towers. You can select to play as either Frodo or Sam. The game follows the plot of the book closely and many locations have accompanying illustrations. Unusually for a text adventure game, the action happens in real time: if you sit there thinking of what to do next, things will happen in the game, e.g. creatures will move from location to location.
