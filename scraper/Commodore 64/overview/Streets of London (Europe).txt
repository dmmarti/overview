Streets of London is a single person text adventure. The game starts with the player waking up in a police cell after a drunken night out. Lying there wondering what to do until the pubs open their doors again, the players character comes up with an answer that becomes the purpose of the game. There's no messing about with magic rings and power stones in this game, the objective is to find the ultimate treasure, the Holy Grail itself. Will the character succeed Where to start and how do they get out of this cell So the adventure begins. Along the way the player will encounter the police, aliens, and Hell's Angels. They will have the opportunity to travel by bus and train to places as diverse as Moscow, Wigan, Hanoi Central and Alice Springs. The game is non-linear, i.e. some events happen randomly, and the text parser accepts simple two word commands.
