A Damsel in Distress needs rescuing by yourself, and so in this single screen platform game, you must get around the screen to reach her over various levels. As you move around the screen, you must collect all the objects on the screen before you can get to the Damsel. You are unable to fall or move off a platform from any height so you must follow a route that allows you to jump from platform to platform to collect all the items. There are various creatures that are on screen and when you land on their platform, they start moving and need avoiding. Umbrellas can be used to move down to lower platforms and if you fall or touch a creature then you lose one of three lives and you have to start the level again.
