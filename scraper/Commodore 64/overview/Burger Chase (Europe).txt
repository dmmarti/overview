Burger Chase is a single screen platformer inspired by the arcade game BurgerTime where you are a chef who has to make four burgers over four levels. On each screen there are various levels with an ingredient and you have to run over each ingredient to push it down a level which will push down any ingredient below. You use ladders to climb up or down the various levels and the whole burger must be on the bottom of the screen for it to be completed. Moving around the screen are some rogue ingredients like eggs and sausages and these need avoiding as touching one will lose you one of three lives. You do have a limited amount of pepper which stuns them for a short time but you can kill them if you push a burger ingredient on top of them. Items appear on the screen and these can be collected for bonus points and extra pepper. Two players can play with each player taking it in turns when the other player has lost a life.
