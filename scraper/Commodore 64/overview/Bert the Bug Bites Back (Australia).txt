Bert the Bug must go around a garden and retrieve twenty of the wizard's scrolls. This task is made difficult by killer toy mouses, fire extinguishers, kettles, and umbrellas that roam every square inch of the garden. Bert can bite back by shooting bullets at them. He loses one of his lives if he makes contact with one of the enemies or if he collides with a wall. Once Bert has collected the twenty spells, he can cast it so that the farmer runs away.
