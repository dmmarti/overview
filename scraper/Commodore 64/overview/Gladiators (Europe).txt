You are the best helicopter pilot there is and due to your heroics you are now part of the Gladiator Squadron. Your job is to patrol over unconquered lands to keep the peace. One day while patrolling eight small islands you receive a call for help. To secure these islands that have great strategic importance, you must go in and destroy the enemy so land forces can move in. To stop you in your path there are lot's of enemy vehicles like helicopters, planes, trucks and boats. Buildings, bridges and aircraft by airfields are needed to be destroyed as well. Power-ups can be collected to help you on your quest which upgrade your weapon, damage meter or score. Gladiators is a 1 or 2 player top down, horizontal scrolling shoot-em-up. The joystick is used to control your helicopter with the fire button shooting your weapon. On the screen you can also see your score, lives and the all important damage meter. In a 2 player game you both take it in turns when a life is lost to play the game.
