Bonzo! is an electronic version of the classical board game Chutes and Ladders. In the game you can challenge a friend or the computer for a play. The only thing you can do is press enter to roll the dice when it is your turn. When playing against the computer you can also press enter to roll for him (or wait a second), so there's little difference in single or multiplayer mode except that the computer player can't be assigned a name but is always called PET.
