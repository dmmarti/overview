A tennis game where camera is always static, which means whether you're on one side of the net or the other, the camera will always show both players from the same angle, which seems like a platform game. You can play a single match or full tournament, as well as resume if you achieved some points while playing before. You can play against computer AI or another player on the same computer, or you can select DEMO for computer(s) to demonstrate you the game.
