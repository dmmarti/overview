Out on a Limb is a flick screen platform game based on the fairy tale Jack and the Beanstalk. You play as Jack (the C64 version has you resembling a famous plumber) who must climb the beanstalk, jump over clouds and explore the Giant's castle looking for a golden harp, golden egg and a bag of gold. There are 23 screens to be explored. As you move about the screen jumping over various platforms you have to be careful not to touch any of the creatures that move about the screens as this will lose one of four lives. Scattered around the castle are other treasures to collect as well and your score is based on how long you spend in each room and how long your game was.
