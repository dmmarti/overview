Pathfinder is a collection of four single screen games aimed at children aged five to eight, with each game having the player control a rabbit, Mr Grub, frog and a kangaroo. The games consist of: Rabbit: A maze game where you have to move a rabbit through a maze to the exit while collecting carrots. Picnic Maze: Played on a 10 x 7 grid, you have to move Mr Grub around the screen collecting food and drink for his picnic. The food and drink have to be collected in order and they are one apple, two bananas, three pears and four cups of tea. You also cannot go back on yourself or cross your path. Frogs: Played on a 10 x 7 grid, you have to move a frog across a pond from left to right picking up your friends on the way. You cannot go on a lily pad, go back on yourself or cross your path. Kangaroo Maze: A maze game where you have to get a kangaroo through a maze to the exit. To do this you have to program his route by telling him a direction and number of jumps. Once you have programmed a route, you press G to see if you make it.
