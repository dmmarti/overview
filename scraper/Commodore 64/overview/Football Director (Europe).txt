After the success of Football Manager, this was one of the first rival attempts. You can choose any league team to manage, although they always start in the 4th division. You will have to hire scouting, physiotherapy and coaching staff before you can do much - you can also hire a youth team for the chance of uncovering a rough diamond. Each week there are up to 2 players available to sign, who are (like your own players) rated out of 10 for form - players with more than 5 will rarely want to play in division 4. Matches are played outside your view, with a minute-by-minute update, and all the other results afterwards. Money management is all-important; you can improve your stadium, sell players, take out a loan, and pay for your club's insurance. Injuries and suspensions, as well as cup and eventually European matches, all add to the challenge.
