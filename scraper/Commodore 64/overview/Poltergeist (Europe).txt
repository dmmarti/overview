You are in control of a exorcist space craft and you must destroy a Poltergeist. Before this though you have to fly over 32 levels and destroy his minions and generators (flashing boxes). After each generator is destroyed you need to land on a teleport pad to get to the next level. There are plenty of weapon upgrades to collect to complete your mission by collecting Power Transmuters (lollipops). Poltergeist is a side-scrolling shoot-em-up that scrolls left and right. The joystick steers your craft while the fire button fires your weapon. Pressing the spacebar will fire a freak bomb. To select your weapon upgrade, keys are pressed on the keyboard (1, 2, 3, CTRL Q, RUN STOP and A). As well as the main playing area you can also see icons for each weapon upgrade.
