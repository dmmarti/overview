Tunnel Vision is a game set in the distant future where 1 or 2 players drive a craft around various tunnels racing each other to capture an orb to take back to the finish line. Both crafts are equipped with lasers and there is also other small crafts to fire at you as well. A track editor is included. The game is viewed behind the craft in a 3D tunnel. The joystick steers the craft left and right and speeds up and slows down. The fire button fires your laser. The 2 player game is seen as a split screen with player one on top and player two on the bottom. Also seen on screen is a map of the tunnel with the players positions, Speed, fuel and shield.
