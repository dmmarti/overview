Mrs. Mop is a cleaning lady in the worst school possible. She has to clean the whole school in sections while being attacked by pupils, teachers and even dogs. To top it all off she also has a bad back which gets worse the more she cleans. When her back finally goes then she has to spend a week to recover. Never fear though, Mrs. Mop has weapons at her disposal like soap which can be thrown or a smart-bomb type substance called Gleamo - which kills and cleans everything in sight. The more she cleans the more she earns. The game is viewed from above and is a multi-directional game. You control Mrs. Mop and each section must be cleaned and a certain amount of enemies have to be killed to progress. All this has to be done within a time limit which is based on her bad back. The more that is cleaned, the more money she earns. You also need to keep your bucket full as well and if nearly empty you have to find places to fill it back up.
