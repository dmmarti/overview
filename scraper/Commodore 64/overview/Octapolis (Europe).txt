By the year 3897 the Galactic Imperium had conquered almost the entire galaxy. Only the planet Octapolis could resist the empire with telekinetic powers that turned the best pilots into bumbling idiots and caused the most sophisticated A.I.s to blow a fuse. However, after 200 years of searching, the Galactic intelligence Agency found a pilot immune to the effects of the mental powers and sent him to deactivate Octapolis' defenses. Your task is to conquer all eight cities and deactivate the planet's defense system. Each level is divided into a shooter and a platformer portion. During the shooter portion, the screen is split in half showing your ship from the side and from above. This means you cannot only move the ship forward, backward, up and down, but also to the left and to the right (by holding down the fire-button which enables you to control the ship's sideway movements in the bottom half of the screen). The ship fires automatically and once a certain number of enemies is destroyed or a time limit is reached, you have to maneuver your ship onto a certain spot and enter the city. Inside the cities you must jump and shoot your way through five screen-sized rooms. Destroying evil eyes will reward you with bonus points. All other enemies cannot be damaged by your weapon and have to be avoided, which is made difficult by the fact that you cannot control your jump in the air. After leaving the last room you continue to the next city.
