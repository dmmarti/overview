Inspired by the arcade game Xevious, you play the role of a mercenary who has accepted the task of flying over a planets surface in your space craft, consisting of ten levels to face and destroy Point X. In this vertically scrolling shooter you must avoid and shoot waves of alien ships as well as bomb any ground installations with the aid of a sight. Some installations will fire back and if you hit a ship or a bullet then you lose part of a damage bar and when it reaches zero it is game over. The joystick is used to control your ship.
