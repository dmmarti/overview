They must brave five rides in succession in order to take on the Grumpasaurus in the final carnival confrontation.Tunnel of Love: Avoid objects in the waterway Duck Hunt: Hit passing ducks with tomatoes Space Ride: Land a spaceship in the correct dock using rocket blasts Bumper Cars: Race around the track and avoid crashing into obstacles Funhouse: Find a way through a small maze filled with guard dogs Battle of the Grumpasaurus: Tickle the Grumpasaurus so that he laughs himself silly The C-64, Apple II and DOS versions of Chaos at the Carnival support two players, taking turns.
