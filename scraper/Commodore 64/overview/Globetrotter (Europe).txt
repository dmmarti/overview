Set in the future, Globetrotter is a side view scrolling game where the screen scrolls to the left or right when the basketball you have to bounce moves over various levels. You control a bat and you have to use it to bounce the basketball from the left of a level to the right and put in it a basket before a timer runs out. You can move the bat anywhere on the screen but the ball will bounce off objects and will burst if it hits certain objects and if it bursts then you lose 10 seconds off the timer. You can change the angle of the bat by holding the fire button down and turning it 360 degrees left or right. Once you get the ball in the basket then you move to the next level and receive a bonus for any time left. Two players can play, with each player playing at the same time and if a player moves off the screen then they lose 10 seconds off their timer and one player has to put the ball in the basket for both to progress. At the start of the game you can select one of the first five levels.
