In this real time all-text game, a sightseeing tour of the Starship Essex turns into hard work when a dying agent recruits you to find a scientist and his formula, the only tool that will empower the Federation to defeat the alien Vollchons. The hardbound book that comes with the game includes the instructions and a novella-length introduction to the plot.
