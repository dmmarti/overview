Blue Moon is a single screen side view shooter where you are the pilot of an Intergalactic Spacecraft and your mission is to rescue a sister ship and it's crew, trapped on a hostile planet. You have to complete five different stages to bring them home to the safety of the Blue Moon. There are many creatures and obstacles and if you touch any or crash then you lose one of five lives. Before you start the game you can select the skill level (1-15). The five stages you have to complete are: Stage One: Your control module needs connecting to the spacecraft and so it falls downwards towards the craft and has to be steered left or right, to connect in the correct place. Stage Two: You have hit a comet storm and so you control your craft at the bottom of the screen, left or right to shoot or avoid the comets. The comets move along the top of the screen but some will move downwards. Stage Three: Alien creatures called Blue Bouncers move around the screen dropping plasma bombs and you move once again left or right at the bottom of the screen avoiding or shooting the aliens but avoiding the bombs. Pods will drop occasionally turning into more Bouncers. Stage Four: A large alien called the Tecom Man moves at the top of the screen and like Stage Two and Three you must shoot him while avoiding droids and eggs that are dropped. Shooting the alien makes him slowly disappear and needs destroying completely to complete the stage. The eggs that are dropped turn into an alien and these need shooting as well. Stage Five: You have finally made it home to the Blue moon and now you have the choice to land on one of three landing pads with the smaller ones worth more points. You start at the top of the screen and you slowly fall downwards and you must line yourself up on a landing pad. Once you land successfully then you start the game again but harder.
