Cred Breaks Out was a game released in association with the British bank, TSB to encourage young people to join, and sees you playing the role of Cred as you attempt to rescue Interrestials from various prisons over four levels. The game is a single screen top view maze game and starting beside your ship on the top of the screen, you must move around the maze to open the door of the Interrestials' prison and lead them back to your ship. As you move around the maze, the prison guards called Ontick's also move around the maze trying to stop the escape. Once you touch a Interrestial or a group then they will follow you but if they touch a Ontick then they disperse. If you touch a Ontick then you lose one of three lives but the level starts again. To complete a level, all the Interrestials have to be rescued before an oxygen gauge empties and if it does then it is game over. Before the game starts you can select which level you want to start on.
