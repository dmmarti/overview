One of numerous games to take the Robin Hood setting, and Codemasters' third, this is a platform game with puzzle solving elements, with similarities to Gods. Robin must rescue Maid Marion from the clutches of the Sheriff of Nottingham, collecting treasure along the way. Robin is armed with a bow and arrow with which to take out gargoyles, trolls and the like. The level designs are long and maze-like, with a need to collect keys and uncover secret passageways in order to find all sections of them, and the gold they contain. Many of the moving platforms are only activated by collecting a key for them from elsewhere.
