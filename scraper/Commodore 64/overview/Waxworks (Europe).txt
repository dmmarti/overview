Number 11 and final entry in the Mysterious Adventures series. You've spent a fun day at the local fair. Now you decide to head over to the waxworks for some fun. But you are tired. You lie down for a snooze... It turns out you are trapped in the Waxworks. Is it all a dream though Around this time, the game engine was redone to allow complete sentences instead of the more primitive 2-word Scott Adams parser that had been used previously although early versions of the game may have still used the cruder parser.
