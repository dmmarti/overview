Hyperrace is a top view scrolling game with some shooter elements where the screen scrolls constantly in the direction you move your spacecraft low over a surface. The game is either one player or two player with a split-screen so both players can play at the same time. You and a friend are both in a Space Academy and to graduate you have to complete various levels by getting from a start pad to a finish pad. As you fly around you must avoid certain obstacles with some that can be removed with your cannon. An other spacecraft makes an appearance and this needs avoiding, and if you hit anything then you lose part of an energy bar. When the bar reaches the red part then the screen starts flashing and when it empties then it is game over for that player. The player that gets to the finish pad first gets bonus points.
