Wizard is a puzzle game with arcade action elements. The premise of the game is to run around the screen collecting various treasures for points, avoiding monsters. The player character must find the key, which gives him the ability to cast magic spells such as fireballs or teleportation, and also unlocks the exit to the next level. Each level takes up the full screen and has its own unique hazards, such as arrows which transport the protagonist quickly, and blocks which are removed when stepped on. The game features six difficulty and nine speed settings. A level designer is included.
