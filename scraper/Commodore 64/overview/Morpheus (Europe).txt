There are 50 sub-universes consisting of a central Nucleus surrounded by 32 Orbitals. The sub-universe is called a Aither. The object of the game is to enter the Aither with your ship and destroy enough Orbitals to shut down the Nucleus. Before the Nucleus dies it spits out a Morphi which when destroyed gives you bonus points and money. Before you deploy your ship from your base you can purchase hulls and weapons. Even sell or scrap the ones that you don't need. The game is viewed from above your large ship. After deploying from your base you can move about freely in any direction. On the screen you can see your score and a small radar which shows the position of the Orbitals and Nucleus. The further into the game you go and buy more hulls and weapons you will end up with a ship that nearly fills the screen.
