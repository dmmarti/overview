You are a robot and you have been tasked to save the spaceship you work on which is infected with a Space Virus and is full of radiation. The ship contains various levels and each level must be cleared to move on to the next one. On each level you must collect four Death Pods which you can only carry one at a time and take it to an Assembly Unit. The pods must also be placed in the Assembly Unit in the correct order. Roaming each level is other robots and when touched decreases your energy but you are equipped with a laser and can blast them which also increases your energy. A pod to collect is represented by a white square and when collected it appears on your status bar as yellow and leaves behind a black square. Move over the Assembly Unit and if it's the correct one it turns white in your status bar, but if it's wrong then it disappears from your bar and appears back in it's original position. The levels are all filled with radiation and you can only withstand so much of it so you much place all four pods in the Assembly unit before a timer counts down to zero. If your energy or the radiation timer reach zero then you lose one of three lives and you have to start the level again. Robobolt is viewed from above with the screen showing a part of the length of the level. The screen scrolls when you move either to the left or the right and the joystick is used to control your robot.
