Your planet is being attacked by an alien force which are more or less invincible. Instead of sending thousands to their deaths to try to destroy it, the solution is to send a fighter pilot to the aliens planets and destroy them to force the enemy into submission. You have been selected for this task and you must destroy a certain amount of alien ships as you fly over the surface of each planet. When you have killed enough then the planet turns a different colour and you fly over the surface again. Once enough aliens have been killed again then the planet is destroyed. If you are shot, touch an alien or hit the surface of the planet then you lose one of three lives. In between planet destroying there is a bonus game where a cursor moves over a row of bonus points. Press the fire button and the cursor slows down before stopping on a bonus point. Then a cursor moves on either Win or Lose. Press the fire button again and this determines if you win or lose. Terminator is a horizontal scrolling shoot-em-up viewed from the side. The control of your ship is similar to the ship in Uridium where the screen scrolls as you move and you can turn your ship around and go the opposite way as well as control the speed of your ship. As well as the main playing area you can also see your score and lives.
