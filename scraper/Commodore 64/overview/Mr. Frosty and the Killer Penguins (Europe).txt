Mr. Frosty and the Killer Penguins is a single screen platformer where you move a snowman around the screen to collect all the snowballs to move to the next screen within a time limit. The snowballs are needed to build three giant snowmen and once all have been built then the game is completed and you start all over again. As well as solid platforms to move on there are moving ladders, platforms that move you along, and platforms that disappear when walked on. Various creatures including Penguins move around the screen as there are obstacles that need avoiding like spikes. If you touch any creature or obstacle, or run out of time, then you lose one of six lives and the screen has to be started again. Once a screen has been completed then you watch an animation of part of the giant snowmen being built.
