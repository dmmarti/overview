In this game, players control Parky who has the task of collecting gold tokens before time runs out. He is under attack by several seaborne enemies such as fish, clams, crabs, stingrays, and jellyfish. Some rooms have more than one exit, so players do not have to follow a single path throughout the one game. Several items, scattered throughout the rooms, help Parky get through the rooms quickly. Collecting tokens awards Parky with 9000 time units. If players run out of time units, or if they crash into a creature or wall, a life is lost. The game is over when all lives have been lost.
