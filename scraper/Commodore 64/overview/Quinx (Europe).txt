Quinx is a top-view single-screen game where you play the role of Arthur Crown, stressing about his final exams in Food Economy at the London School of Economics. The stress has led to Arthur dreaming at night about Ink Worms and a large piece of paper that he is standing on and has to be protected from the worms. The worms appear at the side of the paper and start to move across leaving behind an ink trail. Arthur has to run around the paper and swat the worms to kill them trying to stop any from reaching the other side of the paper. Any ink trail left behind can be erased by a limited use of Tippex. If a worm does reach the other side then they turn into a paper eating monster and eats part of the paper and when it reaches an edge then it explodes. As the worms move across the paper then a Quinx bottle is emptying and when it empties then the part of the paper Arthur is standing on changes colour and if the size is below 25 of the last colour change then it is game over. Fruit appears occasionally on the side of the screen and needs to be collected or points are lost but the more fruit collected then Arthur has to touch a toothbrush or a dentist makes an appearance. A ringing telephone can be answered as well but it could either be good or bad news.
