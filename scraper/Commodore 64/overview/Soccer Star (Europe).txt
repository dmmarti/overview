In Soccer Star you are trying to be the best football manager with the best team. At the beginning you have to start with a team from the bottom division, as you are a new manager. As the seasons go on you can start buying better players and try winning every game so you get promoted to next division; your goal is to win the divisions and the cup. As in the real world of football you have to look after your finances with overheads, spy fees and wages. The game can be saved for later resumption.
