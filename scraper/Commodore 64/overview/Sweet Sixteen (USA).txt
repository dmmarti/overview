A nasty piece of work, the player here controls the actions of a player -- a love-'em-and-leave-'em high school Lothario at Kenwood Academy who takes on a bet from his neanderthal friends of Chicago's Hyde Park area to seduce Nova Tilland, a stunningly gorgeous transfer student from Lab School... and to produce proof. A $500 wager hangs in the balance. Taking advantage of her good nature, the player confabulates a sob story about having a vehicular breakdown in front of her house. She lets the player in to use the phone, through which his co-conspirators arrange for a tow truck to arrive in four hours, granting the player a window of opportunity to realise the dirty deed. Given free rein to wander the house, the player must rustle up some means of documenting their conquest and come up with a scheme by which to distract Nova's father, a dangerous opponent personified in-game as an avid subscriber to Sniper, the Magazine for Gunmen. That done, only navigation of an unlit area and the obligatory secret passage interfere with access to the squalid endgame, an unfortunate ends-justify-the-means exercise in bondage and coercion in a basement dungeon.
