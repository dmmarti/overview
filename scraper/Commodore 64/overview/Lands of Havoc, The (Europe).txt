The Dark Lords have defeated the sorcerer High Vanish and hold the power over the land of Haven. Before he left, High Vanish left magic hidden around the land and now you Sador the reptile man must find various items to defeat The Dark Lords. Haven is split into nine areas which include forest, desert and village. Once a item has been found, a cryptic clue is given on what and where to find the next item. The Dark Lord's aren't going to let you just look around so have sent many and varied monsters to stop you. You can fire and destroy these monsters but if they touch you then your energy bar gets smaller. The Lands of Havoc is a flick screen maze game viewed from above at an elevated angle. There are two skill levels, easier and harder and you can also adjust the speed of the game from 1 (slowest) to 8 (fastest). The joystick moves your character while the fire button fires your weapon.
