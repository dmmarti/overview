The Sorcerer's Apprentice has made a big mistake, casting a spell causing all the brooms to come to life and attack him. These must thus be shot down and destroyed! There are five distinct levels of gameplay. The first three take place in a network of caves, with flip-screen sideways motion, and movement into and out of the screen. Each one contains four scrolls and a magic object (a wand, a silver broom and a winged helmet respectively) to search for and collect. You have five lives and limited time, but extras can be found and collected. Three weapons are available initially (Magic Crystals, Fireballs and Lightning Bolts). Your magic wand is usable from level 2 onwards. Levels 4 and 5 are platform-based, involving precise jumping. Level 4 has four scrolls to collect, while the final level involves destroying witches. These levels have no brooms to face.
