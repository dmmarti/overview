Despite its title, Adventure Construction Set is an editor that allows players to create their own role-playing scenarios. It is possible to customize a tile-set, maps, and objects to create RPGs reminiscent of the early Ultima games. Seven small 'toolkits' to build from include Sci/Fi, Spy, and Medieval setting templates, plus two complete games are included as a demonstration: Rivers of Light is based on Sumerian mythology and contains 140 rooms and Land of Aventuria consists of seven mini adventures with different settings, e.g. an adaption of Alice in Wonderland or a Nazi castle.
