The Thompson Twins were a popular 80's music pop trio who took their name from the Tin Tin comic book. In issue 36 of Computer and Video Games magazine dated 10/84, there was attached to the cover, a free flexi-disc which contained a message from the group plus this adventure game program imprinted in the grooves. Commodore 64 owners had to mail-in an order to receive their free flexi-disc. You could load the program into the Spectrum by connecting a lead from the headphone socket of your record player to the EAR input on the computer. Otherwise, you could tape the disc's contents to a cassette player and load the cassette into the computer (this was only way for the Commodore 64). The story is related to their hit single Doctor! Doctor! and begins with the Thompson Twins on a beach and then a cave. Typical of text adventures, you enter directional commands: north, south, east, west as well as in, out, up, down. Other commands such as look, take, read, dig, and inv (to see what items you are holding in your inventory) are useful. You must find any items along the way and use them where appropriate. As part of the promotion, whoever could get through the adventure and find the secret of the Doctor's potion by November 16, had a chance to win a meeting backstage with the group at one of their concerts and other prizes. Due to delays in producing the Commodore 64 flexi-discs, the deadline was extended to December 31 for those computer owners.
