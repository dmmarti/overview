Once you are both happy with your bets then you can get rid of any cards you don't want and receive the same number back. You can then carry on betting until once again you both are happy and both hands are shown. the player with the better hand wins the money bet. Blackjack: A card game where the computer is the dealer and the idea is to beat his hand to receive money back that you bet which you start with $1000. You both have two cards and you have to get closer than the dealer to 21 or get 21 by either asking for another card or keeping what you have. Once you are happy with your hand then the dealer plays and you either win or lose depending what his hand is. If you or the dealer goes higher than 21 then the other player wins if lower.
