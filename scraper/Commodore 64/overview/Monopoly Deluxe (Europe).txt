Waddingtons Deluxe Monopoly is an updated version of the game Monopoly and based on the classic board game. The game faithfully recreates the rules of the board game and allows six players (human or computer) to compete against each other to make as much money as possible dealing with houses and hotels on famous streets of London. The winner emerges when all their competitors lose all their money and become bankrupt. The whole board is shown at the top of the screen at an elevated angle with a close up of the squares the current player is on below. The options to allow you to play the game sit above the board and can be selected with the joystick or keyboard.
