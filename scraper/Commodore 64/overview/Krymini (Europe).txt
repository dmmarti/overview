Krymini is a puzzle game in which the player gets presented with a 6x6 grid. Balls with different colours are spread out on this grid, along with some unoccupied fields. The goal is to move every ball once: depending on the colour the ball has to be moved by a different amount of fields. After a ball is moved, it is converted into a permanent stone. Each level has to be solved within a time limit.
