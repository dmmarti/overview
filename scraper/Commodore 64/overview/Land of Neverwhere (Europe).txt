A single mercenary has been sent to rescue eight space kids that have become stranded in the hidden silos around Home Base terror. This can be done by guiding the space kid to the building at the right side of the planet, while avoiding its inhabitants. The mercenary can fire bullets at the inhabitants to destroy them. If the mercenary comes into contact with an inhabitant, he will lose a few ego points, and he will have to call it quits when he runs out of ego. If space kids runs into any inhabitant, he is kicked out into space and the mercenary goes back to where he entered the planet. The mercenary must rescue each space kid under a time limit.
