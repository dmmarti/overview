The game begins after the warrior Stormlord's victory over the demonic invasion in the first game. The evil Black Queen is gone, but her surviving followers combine their powers and capture all the fairies again. Now, Stormlord has to rescue the fairies for the second time, fighting his way through six levels from the depths of Hell all the way to Heaven.

Similar to the first Stormlord game, there are fairies to free and monsters to mash all the while avoiding the platform traps. However, the game becomes more of an action sideways game. The game is divided into three levels divided into two sections each, with bosses and bonus levels in the end of each. All of the original's action-adventure gameplay elements are absent in the sequel.
