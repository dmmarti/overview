Professional Snooker Simulator allows the player to play snooker from a bird's eye view of the table, with all the game play involved in a typical game putting spin on the cue ball, judging how much power to hit the cue ball with, and nominating a colour after a legal pot. There is also a practise mode, where the player can place the balls on the table wherever they wish. Action replays are provided throughout the game.
