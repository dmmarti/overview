Soccer Pinball is a pinball game with eight round split across three tables. On the soccer-themed levels, a 'goal' is guarded by 'defenders' who must be removed by hitting them. Score three goals to reach the next level - initially you will face another soccer-based table with more defenders. Other football-themed elements include 'throw-in' positions from the side and pop-up players to toggle for points. On the Amiga version, the later tables have a casino and gambling as a theme. Gameplay is fundamentally the same - hit the correct targets in sequence to advance, with other targets adding to your score.
