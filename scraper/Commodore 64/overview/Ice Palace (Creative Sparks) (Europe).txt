The game is an arcade adventure and contains two screens, the Action Screen or the Adventure Screen. The Action Screen is viewed from above showing a part of the level on the screen. Each level is made up of Hexagon shaped rooms with various objects inside to help or hinder you in your quest. There are six types of rooms and these are empty, a lake which cannot be crossed, a sword which contains various items, a fire which replenishes your firestick, ice which is difficult to cross and a black moline which cannot be entered. Each room has has various entrances and each room can be rotated to align entrances. As you explore the Palace there are various waves of creatures which when touched moves a gauge from good to evil and when it reaches evil it is game over. You can destroy these creatures with your firestick and once a wave is defeated then a spinning cylinder appears and when touched increases your gauge to good. The adventure screen has text and allows you to interact with objects found and solve puzzles. You can also see how many pieces of the crown are found, your good/evil gauge, indicator of any nasties in the area and a candle showing how much time you have left.
