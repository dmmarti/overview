Star Ranger is a comparatively slow-paced side-scrolling Shoot'em Up. The player's ship can shoot in two directions, but the shooting frequency is rather low. Unlike in most other Shoot'em Ups, enemies do not simply fly through the screen and can be either destroyed or dodged. Instead, they stay onscreen, trying to destroy the player's ship until they are defeated. There are numerous different enemy types, each following a unique attacking-pattern. Some enemies try to close in, while others always shoot from a distance. There are also bombers, who fill the screen with indestructible bombs, as well as ships that can become temporarily invisible. To further increase the challenge, there are also passages in which asteroids have to be dodged or the ship has to be maneuvered through narrow passages.
