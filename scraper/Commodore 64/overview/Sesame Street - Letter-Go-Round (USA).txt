The Sesame Street Muppets invite a child player for a spin on the Letter-Go-Round!. By catching and matching letters on a spinning ferris wheel, children practice recognizing and matching letters, simple spelling and word formation. There are several types of game: - Upper case matching;  - Lower case matching;  - Mixed case matching;  - One little word;  - What's missing ;  - Spell the secret word. At the start of each game, one of Muppet pets brings out a letter to match or word to spell and drops it on the seesaw. A letter appears on each ferris wheel bucket and as the Letter-Go-Round spins, child player should find the right letter to match or complete a word. Child may choose and try any letter, because there is no time limit to play. When a match is made or a word is completed, Muppet pets will dance and cheer a child player to the next round of play. The game is recommended for 1 player aged 3 to 4.
