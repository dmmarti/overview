Rings of Medusa is a strategy game with light role-playing and business simulation elements. Located in a medieval kingdom, the game puts the player in control of the former king's son. Unfortunately, an evil sorceress called Medusa has taken control of the country and is now dominating the people. The prince's task is to find five magical rings that will give him the power to overthrow the sorceress and claim back his heritage. In the beginning the hero will try to earn money by doing trade between different towns, or try his luck at bounty hunting or at treasure hunts. Once enough money has been earned to maintain a larger army, the prince will send forth his men to search for the rings which are in the possession of large soldier of fortune armies rallying the lands. Sometimes the player takes part in small arcade sequences like sword fighting and sea fights, or controls an army on the battle field.
