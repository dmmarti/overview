Hundreds of ring worlds are converging on our solar system devouring everything on their path. Now it's up to the player to stop them.nnnnRing Wars features several parts. First, you follow the intelligence reports and locate ring worlds orbiting a planet. Traversing hyperspace, you engage in combat with the ring world defensive fleet, and, after it's defeated, enter the ring world itself. There, you set up a nuclear bomb within its reactor, and have to flee before its timer runs out. Then you depart, setting course to a friendly moon base, to reload your lasers, mount another nuclear bomb, and repair. After a while, the mothership defense goes low enough for you to pursue it. Defeat it and the menace is no more.
