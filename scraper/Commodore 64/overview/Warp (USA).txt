Warp! is an arcade racing game where the player, whose country's research center has just been raided by aliens, needs to rescue kidnapped scientists and recover stolen computers, weapons and microfilms. To pick up a scientist or an item the player has to stop and leave the car and move by foot to the item without getting killed by an alien. In the same way it's necessary to pick up fuel canisters to avoid running out of gas. Hitting any object or alien leads to a life being lost. In addition to fuel it is also necessary to collect energy vapor. As the energy is filled the vehicle is upgraded, first to a turbo racer and then to a jet fighter and finally to a combat tank. With the jet fighter it is possible to fire back at the aliens while the tank can run over road hazards.nn
