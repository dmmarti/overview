Cuthbert, the versatile game protagonist, has this time gone into space. On a series of Joust-like levels, he must clear two stages on each level. The first stage is the fuel stage, where he must fly in his small shuttle from platform to platform and pick up fuel pellets. He can only carry one pellet at a time and must therefore return each of them to the mother ship that is parked on the bottom of the screen. Danger comes in the form of round objects that pass horizontally across the screen at various speeds. It cannot be predicted at what height they will enter the screen, but they can be shot down. The second stage is the loot stage, where Cuthbert must pick up the objects that come falling from the top of the screen, all the while avoiding the same objects as in the previous stage. Once Cuthbert has returned to the mother ship, they travel to the next level. During the space passage, you can encounter troubles, which is handled through a text-only interface. He may have to leave the ship to pick up spare parts, and then return them within a set time limit, or bombs will go off. This is a matter of simply adjusting a set of text coordinates, but the time limit makes the adjustment an urgent matter.
