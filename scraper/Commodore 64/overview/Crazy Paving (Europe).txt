Zigmund has messed up his job by laying the wrong paving stones over four levels so you, Howard the Robot has been tasked to lay the stones as well as clear up the mess left by Zigmund. In this maze game where the screen scrolls when you move Howard, you must find the places that require paving stones and lay them while avoiding the various creatures that move around each level. Gates block routes and keys have to be collected to open them but you can only carry one item at a time and this includes rollers that squash the spiders. As you lay and collect you have to move between the levels using stairs to get for example a key to use on a gate on another level. If you are touched by any creature then you lose one of five lives but you can fire bullets at them to kill them.
