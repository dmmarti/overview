You are a Gnome and your ambition in life is to be King of the Gnomes and the opportunity has arisen for you. There is a document explaining how to be King but the problem is it is in seven pieces and the pieces are lost. The bigger problem is that each piece is in a different time zone which are 9600 BC, 893 BC, 86 BC, 1692, 1849, 3456 and 9999. Luckily in your house you have a Time Machine but a part is missing so you need to search your house for it before you can travel and search Time. In each time zone, puzzles need solving by picking up objects and placing them in the correct locations which even means travelling with them through time and placing them in the correct location in the correct time period. To slow you down you can only carry one piece at a time but you can store in your magic closet eight items for storage which can be entered anywhere by holding down the fire button for a few seconds.. You also have the ability to fire lasers as well. Time Tunnel is a flick-screen arcade adventure with each room or a part of each location shown on the screen at an elevated angle. The joystick is used to control your Gnome and to interact with objects and the locations. The fire button fires your lasers.
