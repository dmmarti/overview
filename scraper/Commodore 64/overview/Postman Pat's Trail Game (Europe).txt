Postman Pat's Trail Game is a top view driving game where the screen scrolls in various directions when you drive Pat's van, and is based on the British stop-motion animated TV series first shown in 1981. The game is aimed at children aged from four to six years old and sees Pat tasked to find various vehicles or animals including Jess, Pat's cat, in the village of Greendale. Starting at the post Office you see the item drive or walk off before you see Pat leave the building and get into his van. Each missing vehicle or animal leaves behind a trail on the roads and you must follow the trail to retrieve the item and go back to the Post office before a timer reaches zero. Crashing into the side of the roads or cows loses more time and if you encounter the cows then they take a while to get off the road so you can either wait or find another route. Once you complete a task you are given a score and a chance to find another vehicle or animal. There are six difficulty levels from very easy to hardest of all.
