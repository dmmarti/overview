You are a Motorcycle speedway racer with 2 other racers. Speedway racing takes place on a flat oval track consisting of dirt or loosely packed shale. You should use this surface to slide your bike sideways into the bends using the rear wheel to scrub-off speed while still providing the drive to power the bike forward and around the bend. Your best time will be saved to beat it later. 4 difficulty levels and a number of laps from 1 to 9 may be adjusted.
