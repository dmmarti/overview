64Luff is a gomoku game. It's played on a 23 by 23 grid by one player against an AI opponent. The players take turns placing their o's and x's on the grid with the aim of getting five in a row. There are two game modes: normal and training. The training mode differs in that it's possible to undo a move and to ask the computer for the ideal next move. The game also has a save and recall option which allows the player to move back to an earlier stage in a game.
