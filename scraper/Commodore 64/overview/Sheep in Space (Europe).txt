The Zzyaxians are on a quest to rule every part of the Universe and have set their sights on the neutron star Sothis B next. In the way are humans who have established a colony to study the star and have made it heavily defended with Mega Super Zappera Proton-Photon-Muon-Zeon Pulsed Beam Ion-Path Hyperatonic Blaster cannons. Instead of an attack on the colony, they have built a Planet Buster Gun which will destroy the colony. To activate the gun they need the energy from the power stations on the supply modules that have Earth-like ecostructure that supply the colony with it's food. The modules are only defended by a Interstellar Space Sheep so the Zzyaxians send in droids to destroy the Sheep and collect the energy. You control the sheep and with your blaster you must destroy 16 droids on each of the 48 levels and save the colony. To aid you, you also have a shield, if it is hit 6 times by a bullet or a droid then you lose one of four lives and it's game over. An other useful feature is the ability to Djump, which allows you to transport yourself to the nearest hostile. One thing to watch though is your stomach, the longer you play the hungrier you get. To fill it you have to land on a grassy part of the module (the rest of the surfaces kill your sheep) to feed. Overfeed and you explode. If the worst thing happens and the colony is destroyed you can still kill all the droids for revenge in Free-Space. Sheep in Space is a horizontal shoot-em-up viewed from the side with the screen scrolling when you move. You can move to the left or right and you use a joystick to control the sheep. The game allows one or two players to take it in turns to play when a life is lost. Before the game starts you can select the first 9 levels and how much charge the Planet Buster gun has from one to four. As well as the main playing area you can also see how many droids to kill, Shields, lives, your stomach status and an indicator to where the nearest energy carrier is.
