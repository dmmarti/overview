You control Tiny Goodbite, one of the California Raisins. All of your friends have been captured and brought to the cereal factory, and you need to come to the rescue! In this action platform game, you need to climb and jump your way through the many floors of the factory to rescue the raisins. On each level there is a key which needs to be collected so you can unlock the door to the next level. Each level is guarded by various bad guys which should be avoided; your raisin may also become energized and shoot the bad guys after landing on the green platform. Be careful when jumping around; if you fall too far or land on some machinery, your raisin will lose a life! The game ends when you have lost all of your raisins.
