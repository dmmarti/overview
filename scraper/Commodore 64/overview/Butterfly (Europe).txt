As the owner of one of the most extensive butterfly collections, you are determined that you will add the eight rarest species for your collection but so far they have eluded you. You have now heard that there is a place where they live and so you have decided to go and attempt to capture the eight species of butterflies over various levels. Problem is there are also various creatures like giant spiders, birds and snakes who will quite happily kill you. Butterfly is a side view single screen game where you control the hero moving him left or right along the ground as well as being able to jump. You are armed with three items, a sword, spray and a net with the sword and spray used to kill the creatures while the net is used to collect the butterflies. The butterflies appear one at a time for a short period and once you catch one then it appears in a grid in the top right corner of the screen. If you are touched by any creature then you lose one of three lives and all butterflies collected are lost. Once eight butterflies have been caught then you go to the next level.
