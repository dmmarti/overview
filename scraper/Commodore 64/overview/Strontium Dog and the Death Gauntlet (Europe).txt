You are Johnny Alpha, a character from the comic 2000AD, who is a Bounty Hunter, Mutant and Strontium Dog and you have been on the trail of two renegade Strontium Dogs, the Stix Brothers. On your way to meet two friends Wulf and Gronk on the Planet of Renegades, you are attacked by the Stix Brothers which forces you to crash land on the planet. The planet is lawless and full of criminals with deadly vegetation, and so you have to cross the planet on foot to meet up with Wulf and Grunt. Strontium Dog and the Death Gauntlet is a side view horizontal scrolling run-'n-gun shooter seen from an elevated angle with the screen scrolling constantly from left to right. You must move Johnny around the screen while shooting or avoiding the criminals, as well as avoiding the vegetation because if you are hit by an criminal or touch the vegetation then you lose part of a strength bar and when empty then it is game over. As you make your way across the planet, shooting the criminals gets you credits. You are able to control the speed of your walk but if you do speed up then your strength bar decreases but going back to the slowest speed decreases it. You are also armed with a limited amount of electro-flares, which stun the criminals, and time-bombs which sends you back in time a short distance. A radar below the playing area shows your position and distance to go to reach your rendezvous. Once you reach the end and meet Wulf and Grunt you then start the game again but on a harder level which can be selected on the title screen (1-5)
