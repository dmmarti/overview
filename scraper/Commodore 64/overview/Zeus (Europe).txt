You are a Wizard and for reasons unknown, you have upset the God, Zeus who is now trying to kill you with his thunder bolts over various levels. The game is viewed from the side with the whole game on the screen and is based on Space Invaders. You run along the ground and try to destroy the thunder bolts as they move across the screen advancing downwards. You are armed with your Cone of Cold but use it too much and your power decreases shown by a gauge on the bottom left. While the gauge is in the green then you can fire upwards towards a cloud but if the gauge reaches red then its reach is limited. If you stop firing then the gauge increases. You also have a shield which also has limited power shown by a gauge on the bottom right but if this decreases fully then you lose it until the next level. Destroy all the bolts on screen and you move to the next level.
