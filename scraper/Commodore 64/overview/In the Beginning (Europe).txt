In the Beginning... is a game that involves you 3000 million years ago as a insignificant molecule, and your aim is to evolve over millions of years to the Dawn of Early Man. The game is split into ten single screen mini-games with each game part of the process of your evolution and each screen has a timer with some games having to be completed before it reaches zero or to survive for the duration of the timer counting down. On the first screen you aim to get the maximum of ten survival points and as the game progresses you will lose and gain points and it is game over when you reach zero. Your first task and screen is as the before mentioned molecule, and you move around the screen touching other molecules moving up the screen. You have to get seven before the timer reaches zero and then it's on to the next part of the evolution. Other screen involves having to avoid other creatures, jumping over gaps, playing snap and get to your home avoiding moving obstacles. One screen has you designing a fish which is then used on a screen if accepted by the computer.
