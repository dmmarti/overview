Exodus is a single screen shooter where your task is to stop creatures and objects from escaping 'The Pit', an octogan shape prison where the escapees appear in the middle and attempt to reach the edge. You move your craft around the outside and blast inwards to stop them but you cannot shoot your friend Spud or you lose one of three lives. There is no loss of life for any escapee from escaping unless it is a Llama where you will lose a life if it does reach the edge, and loss of life also occurs if you touch anything on the edge. A timer also counts down, and if it reaches zero then it is game over but you can shoot clocks to increase your time.
