In Rollin, you must move through a maze arranged in a grid-like pattern. Each of the boxes has a number in it by crossing all four sides, that total is added to your score. Enemies are moving around the screen and must be avoided contact will cost one of your three lives. However, once you enclose all four of the corner boxes, they change colour and can be ran into for a points bonus which doubles from the initial 100 each time. The exact gameplay varies on each level. On odd-numbered screens, the levels are made up of dots, which can be eaten (for points) in any order. Even numbered screens are more restrictive a section of line only remains 'done' if you then complete a box it is in contact with, without moving away from it.
