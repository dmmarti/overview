You own various gardens and grow Pigmy Pines in them, unfortunately there are many creatures who don't like them and want to destroy your gardens. In this side view shooter with a whole garden on screen, you control a spray gun and you must shoot as many creatures as you can to allow four Pines to grow. If any creatures touch the ground then you lose faith shown by a counter and if this reaches zero then it is game over. If your spray gun is also touched then a Pump Power gauge increases and if this gets full then it is also game over. A timer counts down and when this reaches zero then a Pine will grow and the clock resets. In the bottom left of the screen is a hut with a sleeping gardener and if he wakes up the window lights up and your faith is reset. Once four Pygmy Pines have grown then it onto the next garden and more creatures to shoot.
