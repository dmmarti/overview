Last of SSI's When Superpowers Collide series. The Soviets invade Norway! In this strategic simulation of a hypothetical war between NATO and Russia, the Russians invade using Ski troops, and NATO responds in kind. The player controlling the greatest number of towns after a certain number of game turns is the winner.
