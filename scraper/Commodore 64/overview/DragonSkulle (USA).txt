At last my journey s end draws near, as the Isle of Dragonskulle looms closer on the horizon. My search for the evil Skull of Souls had been successful. As I approached the Isle, I felt aware of an evil so powerful that my soul seemed in peril. The Skull had become aware of my presence. Almost at once, shadowy vapours began to envelop my craft and breathe images of death into my face. The terrified screams rang through my head of those who in distant times had challenged the Skull. Their souls torn from their bodies and consumed by its fiery breath. I began to wonder what terrible creatures had been summoned by the Skull to do its bidding and protect it from the magic empowered whitin me.
