Adventure Master is one in a series of adventure creation programs that were popular in the mid-80s and allows you to create text-adventures with some graphics. The system uses a simple two-word parser, so you are limited to commands like Go North or Get Thingamajig. The creation process is not overly complex: You can create rooms, objects and descriptions and add graphical illustrations and words to the parser. Graphics are limited to 160x96 4-color mode; there is also a limit of about ten pictures per created game It also included one complete and two unfinished sample adventures: Becca in Outlaw Cave Clever Catacombs (finished) Wild Trails
