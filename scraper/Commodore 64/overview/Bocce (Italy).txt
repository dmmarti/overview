Bowls is a game based on the sport with the same name. You start by rolling a small white ball (known as the jack). Once it has come to rest the players roll bigger and heavier bowls towards the jack. After each competitor has used up their allocated number of bowls,one player is awarded points for the number of his bowls are closer to the jack than his opponent's closest bowl. The game screen is divided in three parts. Half of it is the lane viewed from a top down perspective, with two markers one for the position of the player and the other for the direction. The upper right part of the screen is where you change you position, direction and spin. The lower right part of the screen shows the player from the sideline. It can be played on different lanes (inside, outside and beach) and can be played against the computer or another player.
