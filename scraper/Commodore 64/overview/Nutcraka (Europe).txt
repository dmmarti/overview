Cyril the Squirrel is due to start hibernating but has yet to collect and store all the nuts he needs to get through the winter. You play as Cyril in this platform game where the screen scrolls in both left and right directions when you move. The game is spread over eight levels and you must collect all the nuts on each level to move to the next level within a time limit. As you move and jump around each level, there are various creatures that include snails, beetles and butterflies that move from the right to the left either on the ground or on a erratic flight path in the air. If you touch any creature then you lose one of three lives and start at the beginning of the level having to collect all the nuts again. Before you start the game you can select the speed (slow or fast) and your starting level.
