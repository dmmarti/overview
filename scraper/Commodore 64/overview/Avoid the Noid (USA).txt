Avoid the Noid is an advertisement ploy for Domino's Pizza. You are a pizza delivery boy who must deliver a pizza to Doom Industries while the creature Noid is set to prevent him from acheiving this goal. You must deliver the pizza to the top floor in 30 minutes or less, or the customer will get a discount and you will lose your job.
