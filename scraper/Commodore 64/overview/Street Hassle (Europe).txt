The player plays the character Duke Davis, who goes from stage to stage beating up gangsters that get in his way, dressed in a yellow tank top, sunglasses, and yellow pants. He is described as a former punk rocker and the "world's coolest" martial artist. Before the start of the next stage, quotes are introduced to entertain the player (such as "Never trouble trouble until trouble troubles you"). The player fights a variety of enemies, such as gorillas and old ladies who throw pocketbooks at the player (resembling weightlifter dwarves who throw dumbbells at the player). Moves include the "bull ram" attack and "trip" move.
