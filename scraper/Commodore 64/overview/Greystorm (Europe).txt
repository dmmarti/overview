After an accident occurred during the testing of a newly developed time machine, you find yourself transported back in time and must travel trough different time periods to get back home. Greystorm is a sidescrolling platformer/shooter. You can jump, crouch and shoot. There are six levels, each with its own theme: Stone Age, Dark Jungle, Modern Times, Techno City, Waterfalls and Middle Ages. To complete a level, a certain number of items has to be collected. However, a new item only appears after the previous item has been collected, which means that completing a level requires a lot of going back and forth.
