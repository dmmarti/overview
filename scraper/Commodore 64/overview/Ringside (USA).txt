Ringside Seat is a realistic simulation of professional boxing, allowing the player to manage the greatest fighters of all time - the game includes data for over 45 great fighters past and present. It can be played as a two-player, one player against the computer, or a no-player (computer managed fight) game. Select a fighter, choose one of eight weight classes or divisions, the number of rounds (3-15) and, should your fighter have the ability to fight as either a boxer or slugger, his fighting style. You will then decide whether you prefer to have the cumulative judges' scores displayed while the fight is in progress or at the end of the fight. Both managers select their fighter's strategy each round. Strategy options are Fight Flat Footed, Cover Up, Charge In, Stick and Move, Stay Away, Go For The Knockout and Protect Cuts. Once both managers have selected their strategy, the round bell will ring and the two fighters will approach the center ring. Using text and semi-animated screen display, you will see the fight in the ring as it happens, blow-by-blow, round-by-round. Each fighter is rated in over 25 categories such as strength, stamina and style. You have the ability to save our fighter and are also given the ability to save a fight in progress to resume at a later date.
