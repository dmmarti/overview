Two distinct basketball games are offered in this package, with 3 skill levels and sets of players. One recreates the real game closely, offering a full league for 1 or 2 human players, which can be saved to disk. The other is faster-paced, with the Flow-Control feature for easier shooting. Shot time limit and match length can be varied, as can kit and court colours. Long range shots and slam-dunks are all available. The game features 9 years of historical statistics for teams and players.
