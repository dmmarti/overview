Speed Zone is a vertically scrolling shoot'em up with a classic style. The player, who flies a latest-generation spacecraft, must destroy all the alien hordes who want to destroy the space federation. The spaceship has a shield with a limited amount of energy. This energy protects the ship from the alien craft's shots. When the energy shield has reached its limit, the player loses one of three lives.
