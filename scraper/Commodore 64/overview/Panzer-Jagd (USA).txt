Panzer-Jagd (German for Tank Hunt) is a game of armored warfare on the eastern front of WWII. You begin the game in command of an assault force of 25 armored and infantry units with each unit representing a platoon. Your mission is to advance across a series of randomly generated terrain maps laced with ambush points. Units that survive each encounter are available for the next battle when a new map will be created. Your goal is to go as far as possible with your allotted forces. Playing time is 1-4 hours depending on your skill.
