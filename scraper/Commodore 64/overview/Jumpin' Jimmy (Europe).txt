Jumpin' Jimmy is a platform game where you control a kangaroo attempting to collect fruit and baby kangaroos over four levels. Each level scrolls left or right when you move and at the start of a level the screen scrolls and you move the joystick to allow your kangaroo to fall to the nearest platform. There are various creatures moving about each level and if they touch you, you lose one of four lives. Falling from any height will also kill you, but you can jump down a certain height. Scattered around each level are various objects which can help or hinder you and these include stars to transport you elsewhere on a level, elevators and objects that make platforms disappear. As well as the main playing area there is also a radar at the top of the screen showing the location of all collectable objects. Up to four players can play and each player takes it in turn when the last player has been killed. Also included with the game is a construction set which allows you to create your own levels.
