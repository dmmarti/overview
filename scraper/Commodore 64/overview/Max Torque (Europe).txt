Max Torque is a motorcycle riding game where you have to complete six stages of a track circuit within a time limit for each stage. Before you race you have the choice of seven riders who all have different bike attributes. Control of your bike is with the joystick and you also have the choice of a low or high gear which is selected with the fire button. As you race along the circuit you will encounter other riders and if hit will slow you down and hitting the side of the track will also slow you down. Hitting an obstacle or rider at high speed will blow up your bike wasting valuable seconds. It is game over if you run out of time or complete all six stages.
