The Power is a puzzle game with similarities to Atomix: The player takes the role of the blob Max who has to collect all hearts divided over the level and then go to his girlfriend Mimi; all within a time limit. However, when Max starts walking into one direction, he only stops when he touches a block. The player also has access to certain blocks of three colours which can be moved with the same rules as Max, but when blocks with a certain colour combination crash against each other (e.g. a moving red onto a green) they vaporize. The game features two playing modes, arcade and tactic, with the basic difference that the arcade mode scrolls and the tactics mode fits each level in one screen. Only the Amiga version has the split-screen multiplayer mode in which two players try to solve a level first. The level editor is not present in the C64 cassette version.
