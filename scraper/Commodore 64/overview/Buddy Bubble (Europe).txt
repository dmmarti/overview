Buddy Bubble is a platform game where the screen moves in various directions when you move and the aim is to move around a maze trying to find the exit in three zones. You can jump gaps between the platforms and use ladders and elevators to help you move up or down to other platforms. Coins can be collected which go towards your score with some hidden behind walls which can be removed by switches. There are many obstacles and hazards to avoid and these are hammers which move up or down, moving platforms and platforms which open and shut. Water and fire cannot be touched and if you are or get smashed by a hammer then you lose part of your energy and you start back at the start of the zone. Once your energy is gone then it is game over and you can select your zone at the start of the game.
