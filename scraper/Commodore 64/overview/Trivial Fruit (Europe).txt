Trivial Fruit is a arcade quiz game where one person or up to four answer as many questions as they can to win the game. Before you play you can decide whether there is a timer to answer a question and you can choose the timer to be up to 995 seconds. You can decide as well how many players and if you want the short game or long game. On screen there is a 3x5 grid and when a question on a variety of subjects is asked each answer represents a fruit. Get the answer correct then the fruit appears in a set position in the grid. You then answer the next question. Get it wrong and if playing another person then it's their turn until they either win or get a question wrong. You can play by yourself but there is no score so you try to win in the least number of questions. The short game requires the winner to get just a line of three of the same fruit and the long game is to fill the whole grid with fruit.
