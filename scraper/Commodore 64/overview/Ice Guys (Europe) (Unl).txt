Ice Guys is a platform game with cartoon graphics. One solo player or two team mates fight against a horde of little monsters. Their only weapon against the creatures is the snow on the ground - but there is plenty of it! So they keep throwing snowballs at their attackers to get them caught in an avalanche. The avalanche can be kicked thus turning it into a deathly bowling ball. Combination hits will be rewarded with goodies which can be collected. Diamonds can be traded for special items in a shop. Stars will qualify the players for a sleigh race bonus game and ice creams will eventually be turned into extra lives.
