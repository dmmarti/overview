Players must compete in a race organized by the Intercontinental Rally Championship. Since the competitors are still involved halfway through the race, The IRC introduced new rules: The races are to be held at night, and each car must be fitted with explosives with built-in timers, which can only be defused at official checkpoints. Players must drive their cars through the dark pine forests, avoiding green cars in an attempt to out-position the yellow car of the race leader. But players must complete each stage within a reasonable amount of time, or they are out of the game.
