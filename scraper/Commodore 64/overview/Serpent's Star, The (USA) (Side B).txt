This game in an interactive fiction computer game with graphics, in which you steer the main character by typing simple text commands and figuring out what to do next in order to reach the goal of the game, namely to find the Serpent's Star. Scenarios are described in writing with accompanying graphics. The player has to solve puzzles and find out which items are needed and how to react in certain situations in order to make his way to the end of the game. In this game you assume the role of archaeologist Mac Steele who has to find a legendary gem by studying various ancient scrolls which unfortunately were taken from him earlier on by a rival archaeologist. The Serpent's Star is the sequel to Ultrasoft's earlier text graphic adventure Mask of the Sun. Instead of travelling through Mexico this time, Mac Steele is on his way to Tibet and the famous city of Kara-Koram.
