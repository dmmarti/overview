Revs+ is the sequel to Revs. The game adds new circuits to the original game's Brands Hatch and Silverstone: Oulton Park, Snetterton, Donington Park, and Nurburgring, which includes competing against computer controlled racers on those circuits. The player can adjust the car's front and rear wings for optimal performance on different circuits. A computer assisted mode is available for players without an analog joystick.
