The Way of the Exploding Fist is a martial arts doctrine ensuring that you possess a range of powerful punches, uppercuts, roundhouse kicks and flying kicks. As an evil warlord has enslaved your people, courtesy of his many henchmen and mercenaries, you will need them as you journey to his mountainous hideout to destroy him. The game is no longer a single screen sequence of Yie Ar Kung Fu style duels, but is more influenced by Renegade, although with strict martial arts moves. However, a combat practice program is also provided, which plays much more similarly to the original game. The action takes place on different levels, which are reached by traversing ladders. There are many doorways to walk through, which cause a switch in the usually-scrolling display.
