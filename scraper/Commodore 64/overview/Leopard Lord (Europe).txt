You are Prollen the Mercenary and after first turning down 1000 gold coins, you have finally agreed to search for and kill Fordel the Evil Wizard for 10000 gold coins, not just for the money, but to rescue your friend. The Wizard is the leader of a viscous clan and also called the Elite Leopard Lord who is planning to take over the world by summoning a demon from the Nether Pits. To do this he needs to rip the still beating heart from a living body and your friend, Braneth is to be the sacrifice. The ceremony will take place on Midsummers Eve which is actually tonight. You must search the land, killing various creatures to find the location of the bloody ceremony and dispose of the Wizard once and for all. Leopard Lord is a text adventure where the screen has text that describes your surroundings and you type in commands with the keyboard to interact with with each location that you visit.
