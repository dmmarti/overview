A chance encounter with Bigleg, a dying dwarf, hastens your wary adventurer to the tower of the helpful wizard Yaztromo, who supplies you with magical equipment you will need in order to survive a trip through the adjacent Darkwood Forest, searching for lost Dwarfish Runes of the Ancients needed by Stonebridge's mayor, Gillibran, to save his people from the predations of hill trolls. A very by-the-book adaptation of Ian Livingstone's Fighting Fantasy gamebook #3, published the previous year, this computer game version dishes up its Choose-Your-Own-Adventure illustrated multiple-choice plot paths courtesy of pages of narrative text displaying down an endless scroll and automates the random RPG elements of generating and managing your character's statistics, inventory and performance in combat, ordinarily determined through die rolls.
