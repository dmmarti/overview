Spooks is an action-adventure game where the goal is to collect eight musical boxes and play them at the exit. The game is set in and around a large mansion which is haunted by four ghosts against which you can defend by throwing large or heavy objects at. Around the mansion there are many rooms and many items whose function you need to figure out in order to complete the game. Adding to the suspense is the need to be on alert for the ghosts as they move quite fast and also that when in inventory menu you only get a short time to make your decisions.
