Fort Defiance is a half completed stockade blocking the path of an invading army that heavily outnumbers you during the War of 1812. You command a lone Napoleonic era artillery piece and its crew and are guarding the weakest point in the forts defenses. Your performance will determine whether the fort will stand or fall. The game is played under a handicap system (from 1-63). The lower the handicap you choose at the beginning the faster the enemy will break and run. The handicapping system insures that each attack which is repelled is followed by a more determined effort. As commander of the artillery piece it is up to you to select the type of ammunition, fuse length, elevation and target.
