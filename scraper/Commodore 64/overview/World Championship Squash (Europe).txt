World Championship Squash as the name suggests is a computer version of Squash for one to two players. You can play either a single match or play in a tournament. You have the choice of eight players as well to choose from. The number of rounds, skill level and ball type can also be adjusted. Normal squash rules apply and the server can only score a point. The game is viewed from behind the players at a elevated angle behind the court. The joystick moves the player and the fire button swings the racket. Pressing up and fire smashes a low ball and pressing down and fire lobs a high ball.
