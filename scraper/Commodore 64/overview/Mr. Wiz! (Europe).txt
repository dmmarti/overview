The good land of Midgard and the evil land of Neflheim have long been joined together by a powerful spell, which has long been acceptable, but now the evil is starting to seep through. As a novice Wizard you aim to earn enough points to become a top-level wizard and cast the spell which might blast the worlds apart. Unfortunately, the powerful wizards feel this is too dangerous, and will set out to stop you any way they can. The gameplay resembles Gauntlet, as your wizard is viewed from above and shoots bolts of magic at enemies. There are in fact four control modes - the other three allow you to prepare more advanced spells, learn them by reading the books, and buy additional spells. Spells must be prepared in real-time, and miscasting a spell can have disastrous effects.
