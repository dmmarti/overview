A hostile power station has been discovered in a huge underground cavern. Your mission is to destroy it. Your battle chopper is equiped with a cannon and a limited supply of fuel. As you navigate the maze-like cavern avoid the bad guys shooting at you and head for the nearest way-point where you can rest for a minute, save your game and refuel your helicopter.
