A musical game with four modes: Catch a Coco-Note - Pick notes out of a pool with your fishing pool. Once you've picked enough you can hear the band play the melody you've picked out. Composin' Coco-Notes - Same game as the first, except now played with an accompaniment. Beat The Clam - Race against a clam trying to claim notes from the pool and get a high score while finishing the song. Collect bonus notes for extra score and avoid the clam as he'll eat your fishing line as well. Beat The Clam -- Challenge - Same game as above except the clam is much faster.
