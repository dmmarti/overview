Phantasie II is the sequel to the role-playing game Phantasie. Nothing has changed substantially: the gameplay and the graphics are identical to Phantasie. The adventuring party travels from town to town using a overview map of the countryside. There are many dungeons to explore and many different monsters to battle. Again the Dark Lord Nikademus is the players' evil opponent, having fashioned an evil orb and cast a curse on the beautiful island of Ferronrah, enslaving its people. The players' mission is to find and destroy the evil orb.
