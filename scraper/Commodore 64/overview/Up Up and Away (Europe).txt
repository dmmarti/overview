Up Up and Away is a horizontal scrolling game where you have to fly a hot air balloon from base to base avoiding obstacles such as clouds, trees, kites, birds and people throwing rocks. You have a limited supply of sandbags and fuel and these decrease the higher the difficulty level is (0-5). Moving the balloon upwards consumes fuel so careful control needs to be observed. Sandbags can be used to hit people or hit icons with the letter P to improve your score. Refuelling stations to land on are also along your route. The keyboard or a joystick is used to control the balloon.
