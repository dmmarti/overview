Grandmaster is a one player chess game where you play the computer at chess with ten skill levels (0-9). As well as adjusting the skill level you can also watch the computer play itself, receive hints, force the computer to play the move it is currently thinking and change board colour. You use the keyboard to type in your moves and the default setting is skill level one and you play as white.
