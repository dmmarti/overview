Pure-Stat College Basketball is a sports simulation that allows you to replay individual games or entire basketball seasons, from the past or present, while keeping a permanent record of your team's stats using the built in Stat Compiler. In this simulation, you can re-live the excitement of the UCLA teams from the 1960's through the teams of the 80's. The game features 20 all-time great teams (as of 1987). Game play features 5 on 5 games across three game modes, 1 on 1, 1 vs CPU, and CPU vs CPU. The stat compiler was fairly robust for the time period and tracks steals, blocked shots, assist, rebounds, field goal percentage, foul shot percentage, and time played. The game has managerial aspects to it in that you choose your offensive or defensive play, and then let the computer figure out the play. There was an optional team/trade players disk as well.
