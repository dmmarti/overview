The secluded Caribbean island of St. Malcolm is getting a visit from a cricket team from the UK to play the islanders with a hidden agenda to get the rights to the local natural resource, Guano. You are the manager of the team as you fly towards the island but things don't go too well as you get hijacked and later crash the plane. After surviving the crash, your aim is to get yourself and the team to the cricket ground where the game is going to be played. Cricket Crazy is a graphic text adventure where the screen has a picture of your location and text describing what you can see. You type in commands with the keyboard to interact with your surroundings and if you manage to get to the ground you can interact with the actual cricket game.
