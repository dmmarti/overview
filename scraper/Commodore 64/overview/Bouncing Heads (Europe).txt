Bouncing Heads is a top down view maze game where the screen scrolls when you move and the aim is for you to control a bouncing head and collect a certain amount of lips to move to the next level. As you move about the floating maze there are various creatures which move about the maze and if you touch one then you lose one of three lives. You are armed with a gun but the ammo is limited but you can collect more that are scattered around the maze. Certain squares have icons on them and these can help or hinder you and these include direction arrows, clock to add or take off time, trampoline to bounce further and water which drowns you. Once you collect enough lips within the time limit then you find the exit square and move to the next level. The levels can be selected at the start of the game and one or two players can play taking it in turns when the other player dies.
