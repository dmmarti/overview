Metranaut is a single screen platform game where you control a spaceman trying to collect all the fuel pods on various screens which also make up some of the platforms. To collect a fuel pod, you have to colour in the pod as you walk over it and once all have been collected then it's onto the next screen. As well as walking you can use your jet-pack to move in the air a short distance and each screen has to be completed before your air runs out. Also on the screens are aliens which move in a set pattern and have to be avoided or you lose one of five lives. Other platforms are ones that slowly disappear when walked on. Included in the game is a screen editor where you can design and build your own screen before playing it.
