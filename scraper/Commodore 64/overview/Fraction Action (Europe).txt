Fraction Action is an educational platform game where the player has to escape the basement of a mad professor's mansion by answering fraction problems correctly. Electric gates prevent the player from leaving and for each one there's a gatekeeper asking questions. Answer them correctly and the gates will open. If an answer is wrong an explanation screen will open showing how the problem can be solved. Between questions the player moves left and right and has to reach a teleporter to be transported to the next floor while slides have to be jumped over to avoid going back down again. After passing through the final gate the player gets the chance to catch the ghost. The ghost moves around the screen and the player has to catch up with it and touch it within a given time limit. Some customization can be done before starting the game. There are three difficulty levels to choose from: easy where all problems have the same denominator, medium where the fractions have a denominator less than six and hard where it is less than ten. It's also possible to set a timer for each problem and how long it's going to be. There also different operations to choose from: addition, subtraction, multiplication, division and a variety. The game can be played by one or two players.
