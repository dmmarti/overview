Sherlock Holmes in Another Bow is the first title in the short-lived Living Literature series of interactive fiction titles by Bantam Software. In this original story, an aging Holmes in his sixties becomes involved in a murder mystery aboard the steamship S.S. Destiny. Holmes and his companion Dr. Watson are awakened by a crewman to find an apparent suicide on the ship. There is something mysterious about this suicide, of course, and it's up to the famous detective to find out the truth. As his mind is not as sharp now, he will rely on the player as his longtime companion Dr. Watson to help him with the investigation. There are many characters (including famous real-life figures such as escapist artist Houdini, Gertrude Stein, Sir Lawrence of Arabia, Pablo Picasso and Thomas Edison) to observe, follow and spy on, and determine who may be a suspect during the time-limited game. There are six smaller cases within the whole mystery which must be solved in order to arrive at the final truth. The player also must be discreet in the investigation; ordering Holmes to do anything offensive might ruin his reputation.
