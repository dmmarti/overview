This is an isometric tile jumping game where you control Flip the Kangaroo or Flop the monkey attempting to outrun a zoo keeper and light all marked tiles. The main difference between kangaroo and monkey game play lies in the fact that monkey levels are played upside down with Flop hanging upside down on the ceiling. Levels become progressively more complicated and change color with each attempt.
