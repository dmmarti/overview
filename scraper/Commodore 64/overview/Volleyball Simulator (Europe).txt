Volleyball Simulator is, probably not entirely surprising, a game about the sport volleyball. The game features full six-athlete teams and the original rule set with one playing mode: a single match, either against the AI or another player. However, there is room for customization with the tactics menu. Here players can set the defense and offense strategy and the position of every athlete.
