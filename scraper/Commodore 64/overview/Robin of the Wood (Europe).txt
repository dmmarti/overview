As the outlaw Robin of Sherwood, you aim to win recover the prize of the Silver Arrow from the Sheriff of Nottingham. Before you can enter the contest to recover the arrow, you must purchase your equipment from a tree spirit (Ent) hiding in the forest. And to purchase your equipment, you wander the forest in search of moneybags or rich nobles who you can ask for a donation. There are allies, such as the Hermit, who will heal your wounds providing you don't attack him. There are also foes such as Norman soldiers, the Sheriff of Nottingham, witches and wild boars who will impede your progress to enter the contest. In a nutshell, wander the forest gathering money to buy your sword, bow and arrows while avoiding/defeating your enemies. You can also collect flowers to placate the witch who will send you to some other part of the forest instead of taking your money and locking you in the dungeon.
