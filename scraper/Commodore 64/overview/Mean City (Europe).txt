In the cities of the world, humans once again have a new battle, after surviving a world wide nuclear war there is a new war against against semi nomad mutants who live outside the cities in the barren wastelands. You take the role of one such mutant named Sante and you have to attempt to enter the city of Concurb 2 G-Gow to rescue your Father, Hante who is the leader of the Tribal Federation of Mutants. Once you manage to enter the city you must find four pieces of a digital key to enter your Father's cell and take him back to your cave outside the city. To make matters worse, your cousin Calte (played by player two or the computer) is also trying to gain entry and find your Father, not to rescue him but to kill him so he can become leader and if he finds you as well he will kill you. Mean City is viewed from above with the screen split into three horizontal sections with the top and bottom parts the playing area for the players. The middle part of the screen has both players panels which show the score, health, lives, messages and a pointer showing the direction of the nearest mutant. As you move about outside and inside the city controlled by the joystick, you can shoot or avoid the humans, droids or police and if you touch one or are shot then you lose health which is shown in your panel as a heart monitor which decreases the more you are hit. Once you lose enough health then you lose one of five lives. Some citizens will leave behind a weapon which can be collected but only before they stop flashing.
