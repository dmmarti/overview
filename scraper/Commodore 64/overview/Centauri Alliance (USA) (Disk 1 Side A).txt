Describing Centauri Alliance as The Bard's Tale in Space would be fitting since it was designed by Michael Cranford, the creator of the first two Bard's Tale games. In this science-fiction RPG, players build a party by designing characters from six different races and arming them with a variety of weapons and psychic powers. They then set off across a cluster of star systems on a secret mission to find a powerful super-weapon and save the worlds of the Alliance from evil forces. The game contains most of the standard RPG elements of late '80s games including first person 10' X 10' square adventuring maps, turn-based combat and an ongoing quest to find bigger and better ways to kill things.
