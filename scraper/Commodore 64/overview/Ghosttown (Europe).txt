Ghosttown is little more than a side-scrolling shooting gallery and features a single level where the objective is to shoot the cowboy targets as they appear whilst avoiding shooting innocent bystanders. The player does not take damage, but failure to shoot targets in time will result in depletion of ammunition (as indicated by the counter in the bottom left of the screen). Once you reach the end of the level, the game increases the difficulty by reducing the amount of starting ammunition and makes you play through the same level again.
