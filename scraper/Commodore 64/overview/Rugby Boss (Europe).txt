Rugby Boss allows you to manage a team in the form of rugby popular in the North of England and take them from Division 2 and become champions of Division 1 as well as any cups. You have various options like buying and selling players, selecting your team and looking at the fixtures and League Table. Once you are happy with your selections it is on to the next game which is just represented by text. You see a timer counting upwards to 80 mins and the names of both teams playing. Text appears when any scoring incident occurs.
