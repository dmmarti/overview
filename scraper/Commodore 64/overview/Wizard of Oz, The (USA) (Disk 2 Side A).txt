Based on the famous novel by L. Frank Baum, the Wizard of Oz places the player in the role of Dorothy Gale, who is transported by a cyclone to the magical world of Oz. Accompanied by her dog Toto, a Scarecrow, a Tin Woodman, and a Lion, she tries to find her way to the Emerald City, where she hopes the Wizard of Oz can help her find a way back home. Gameplay-wise, the game is a traditional text adventure with graphics. The player can type in various commands to interact with the game world, manipulate objects, talk to NPCs, or ask Dorothy's companions for help.
