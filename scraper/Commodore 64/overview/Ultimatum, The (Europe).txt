Life has been great since you left school five years ago, you have none absolutely nothing, except laze around watching TV. Well now your parents have had enough and thrown you out of the house with an ultimatum, get a job. With no money since your dole was cut off and no where else to live, you better get that job and sort your life out so you can return. There are different times of the day to take into consideration with certain things happening at different times as well as characters that need interacting with. RJ's Ultimatum is a text adventure with the screen having text describing your location and you type in commands with the keyboard to interact with your surroundings.
