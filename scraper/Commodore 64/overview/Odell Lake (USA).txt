Odell Lake is an educational simulation game about the lives of fish. Set in an underwater ecosystem, players play as one of several species of fish and play by selecting actions from a list at each junction in the game. The goal is to survive and find food while avoiding hostile creatures and exploring the lake. There are two ways to play, go exploring or play for points. In play for points mode the player is assigned a random species of fish to play as and earns points for making the best decision in each encounter. Species of fish include rainbow trout, whitefish, and mackinaw trout. There are other living things around the lake as well including fishermen, plankton and otters.
