Orpheus is an explorer and in his new quest he has discovered a passage into the underworld of Hades. Problem is, once he has entered he can't leave unless he collects all the treasure scattered all over the place. Once the treasure is collected Orpheus can leave but in his quest for freedom he must avoid creatures, obstacles and traps. Orpheus in the Underworld is based on the game Pitfall where the game is flick screen and viewed from the side. There are two levels on the screen and you can move between them via ladders or gaps in the floor. Creatures move about and if you touch one then you lose one of three lives as well as falling into pits. There are also obstacles to overcome like pits with rope swings and traps like holes appearing.
