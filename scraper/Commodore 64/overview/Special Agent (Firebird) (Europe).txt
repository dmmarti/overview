You have been sent into Moscow to help another agent, Felix 'The Cleaner' Hoover who has infiltrated the KGB Headquarters to steal blueprints to a secret Soviet Spacecraft but he has been discovered. You must help him complete his task before helping him escape by shooting any KGB agent who gets in your way over various levels. The game is a platform game with a part of the level shown on the screen and will scroll when you move.You are short of Western money so you must search every door on each level to find money, documents and other bonuses as well as a key. To move down to other platforms you must use elevators and you will lose one of five lives if you fall too far or if you are shot. A joystick is used to control your hero.
