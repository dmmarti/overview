Gertrude's Puzzles, like its companion game Gertrude's Secrets, is an educational title featuring Gertrude the Goose, although it's intended for a (very slightly) older audience. Here, too, the player roams around an interconnected series of chambers, and (with Gertrude's aid) solves puzzles which exercise logic, pattern recognition and visual interpretation skills. The tour of Gertrude's residence begins with a tutorial, which introduces the concept of interacting with objects by using the cursor. The three types of puzzles are based on manipulating and sorting objects according to their shapes and colors: the Box Puzzles challenge the player to arrange objects on a grid; the Network Puzzles, on a relationship graph; and the Layout Puzzles, in a sort of Venn diagram. Solving each puzzle awards a random prize from Gertrude, and the prizes are collected for display in the Treasure Room. For variety's sake, the appearance of puzzle pieces can be altered by choosing from six predefined sets -- or by visiting the designated Shape Edit room, where players can create and modify custom pieces.
