In the future, working conditions in agridustrial combine compounds are a step back to slavery, with no prospects, long hours and poor treatment. One day THX2240 (an obvious George Lucas reference) decides she's had enough, and steals a Crowd Control vehicle to escape. Escaping from the whole 10-level complex is a big task though, as each of the many compounds has its own locks. These can be removed using mirrors to guide a solar beam onto the locks, weakening them. There are patrol guards trying to stop you, and each time you fire a beam and it fails to open a door, you lose a life. The action is viewed from above with a pseudo-3D feel.
