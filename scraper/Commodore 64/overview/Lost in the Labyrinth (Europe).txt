Lost in the Labyrinth is a top view maze game where you are an explorer and it is your quest to move around the labyrinth and find staircases to move up the levels before finding the exit. As you move around you will encounter various creatures and if you touch one then you are shown a close-up of you and the monster and you must fight it to kill it. If you are killed by a monster then you lose one of four lives, and when they are gone, you are given a score and a comment on your attempt. There are also various objects that can be found and used in your quest and these include hammers, spears and bombs. Control of your hero is done with a light pen which allows you to touch the screen and use dots to move as well as use and drop objects found.
