You are Teddy and on the way to the teddybears picnic you have got lost in a forest and you are getting hungry. As you look for the way out you discover a giant beehive full of honey so you have decided to enter the hive and collect all the honey over 16 levels. Bizy BeeZZzz is a single screen platform game where you start on the bottom right corner and you must collect the honey from various pots scattered around on the screen. You use ladders to climb to higher platforms with lifts moving up or down on later levels, and gaps have to be jumped. Giant bees patrol the hive and these can only move over platforms and up or down the ladders and if you touch one or fall through a gap then you lose one of five lives. If you don't collect all the honey before a timer reaches zero then a larger bee appears and kills you. Once all the honey is collected on a screen then you move to the next level but you can select any level at the start of the game.
