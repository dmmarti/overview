Krillys has stolen the Zodiac Power Source and broken it into six pieces, and Sarnak has been sent to find it and hopefully rescue his friends Teron, Gorman and Tartarus. He travels through the Ebbedown Forest initially, with gameplay similar to Ghosts and Goblins. The journey is largely from left to right, although downward movements through gaps and upward movements on rotating platforms are also frequent. Some drops can be fatal, but mostly those which have a platform in close reach, so these are avoidable and not purely random. There are many magic teleports en route, and the high trees narrow the journey. Extra lives (via collecting 8 crystals) and improved weaponry are on offer throughout your quest.
