Mind Control is a single screen game split into two parts where your mission is to destroy Zyco, an indestructible alien who is ruling Earth and enslaving all humans. Scientists realising that Zyco can't be destroyed, have worked out that his only weak spot would be the massive sensory neurone in his brain and so have selected you to be shrunk to enter his bloodstream to move around his brain before destroying the neurone with a laser. The first part of the game is a platformer where you must get from the bottom right of the screen and climb stairs at each end of the three levels that make up the screen to get to Zyco's brain. Trying to stop you are people and these have to be jumped or if you touch them, then you lose one of three lives. At the top of the screen is a Miniaturising Room where you are shrunk before you enter the brain. The second part of the game has you viewing the brain from the side and you have to make your way from the bottom of the screen to the centre of the brain following a path. As you move around the brain there are white blood corpuscles and anti-bodies following a set path and these must be avoided or you increase in size and a life is lost. The walls that make up the path also make you grow if touched so these have to be avoided as well. Once you reach the center and destroy the neurone you then keep attempting to move around the brain over various levels where the enemies get faster. The ACE release doesn't have the first platform part of the game, just the moving around the brain part.
