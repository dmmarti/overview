Cobra on the C64 adapts the 1986 Sylvester Stallone movie like its counterparts on other 8-bit systems. It is similar to the Spectrum version, but features unique level designs and gameplay mechanics. The player controls ultra-tough cop Cobra who must make his way through three side-scrolling levels: the cityscape, a rural area and a factory. Hordes of goons will try to kill him where he stands and attack with throwing knives, axes, grenades and guns. At the beginning, Cobra is unarmed and can only evade or punch out his enemies, but he can pick up weapon icons to increase his damage potential. Available are knives, grenades, a pistol and a machine gun (guns and ammo have to be collected separately). Ammunition for all weapons is limited. Cobra can refill his health by picking up hamburgers. Not all that moves has to be killed: sometimes, innocent civilians cross Cobra's path. Shooting them will cost him a life. In levels one and three, Cobra also has to find fashion model Ingrid, then lead her along to the level exit.
