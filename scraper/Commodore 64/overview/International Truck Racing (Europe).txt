This overhead view racing game is a serious simulation of the exciting sport of truck racing. This explains the apparently slow, jerky scrolling and rickety collisions, as this is how real trucks handle. There are 6 trucks in each race, which take place across famed international circuits. Every couple of laps you must refuel, which is done by driving into the pits and collecting the flag in your car's colour. The top 3 finishers in each race score points, and you must finish in the top 3 to progress to the next round.
