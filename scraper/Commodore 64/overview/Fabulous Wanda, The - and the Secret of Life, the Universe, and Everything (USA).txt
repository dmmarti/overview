You're just cruising along one day in your space ship when you are contacted by some security guy who demands your name. He says all ships in this area are to be destroyed; however, if you'll do a job for him, he'll let you live. He wants you to beam down to the planet Copus and find The Fabulous Wanda A.K.A. Jet-Bike and learn from her the secret to life, the universe, and everything. But it won't be easy since you'll need one basic thing: money... The Fabulous Wanda has an adventure-like structure: the protagonist visits various locations and completes tasks to get closer to the goal. However, most of the gameplay is dedicated to gambling. The objective of nearly every task is to win enough money (called klebs in the game) to advance the story and proceed to the next task.
