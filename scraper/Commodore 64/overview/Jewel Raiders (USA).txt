2-Up: Jewel Raiders / Distance Demons is a double games pack that contains the following games: Jewel Raiders: In this side view single screen game, you are part of the Galactic Jewel Raiders and you have entered a vault to steal two jewels and put them through the Green Window. Starting at the bottom of the screen, you must make your way to the top of the screen, collect a jewel and head back down to the bottom. Between you and the jewels are forcefields that move across the screen with gaps in, forcefields that turn on and off, and finally two guards, either side of the screen that head towards you or move up and down. You are able to shoot sideways to kill them, but another one appears. If you touch a guard or any forecefield then you lose one of three lives. Distance Demons: In this horizontal scrolling driving game viewed from the side at an elevated angle with the screen scrolling constantly from left to right, you must drive and overtake other cars. The aim is to drive for as many laps as possible while trying to get the biggest score that you can. You start driving at 60 and once you go above 100 then your score increases and the faster you go the quicker your score increases. You can move up or down, and left or right, and if you hit another car or the sides of the track then you lose one of three lives and have to start again.
