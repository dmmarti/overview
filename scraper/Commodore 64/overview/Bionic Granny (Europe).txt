Bionic Granny is a top view single screen game where you play the role of a Bionic Granny who likes nothing better to do than wait outside a school at 4 o'clock and wait for the children. Once the children leave the school you have to move left or right on the bottom of the screen and hit them with your walking stick by touching the children as they pass you over various levels. There are three roads going down the screen where the children will walk but some move around the screen randomly. A Lollipop Lady moves around the screen and will throw lollipop sticks at you which need avoiding or you lose one of three lives. Once you hit a certain number of children then you move onto the next level.
