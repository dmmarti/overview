Twister is a Tetris clone where you have to stop a box seen from the side, filling up with shapes of various sizes. As well as the normal shapes made up of four blocks, there are also shapes made up of three and five blocks. The box starts off empty and the first shape falls slowly down the screen and here you can move it left or right, or move it down the screen faster. Pressing the fire button will move it round 90 degrees, and when the shapes reaches the bottom of the box then it cannot be moved anymore. A box on the right of the screen shows the next piece to fall. When a full horizontal line is made across the box, then the line disappears and the shapes above fall down into the empty gap. Once a certain amount of lines have been made then you move to the next level where the shapes start to fall down the screen faster. If a shape touches the top of the box then it is game over. Before you start a game you can select your starting level from one of ten levels (0-9).
