Pinball Spectacular is a single-screen top-view game which is a cross between pinball and Breakout where you control two bats on the bottom and middle of the screen to hit various objects to score as many points as you can. On screen there are blocks to remove, bumpers to hit and letters to hit to light up the word COMMODORE. If the ball goes past the bottom bat then you lose one of three lives. Two players are able to play with each player taking it in turns to play when the other player loses a ball.
