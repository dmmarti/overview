Earth is in trouble and requires a pulsebomb which is being delivered to Earth by the cargo ship Dreadnought Nine. Problem is that a droid on transportation to the ship has lost the bomb and needs recovering or it's the end of Earth. You play the droid in this flick screen platform game as you search the craft for all nine pieces of the bomb avoiding other droids who drain your energy when touched. You are armed with a gun and can shoot the other droids with pods scattered all over the craft to increase your firepower as well as some pods to increase your energy. Also in various locations are transporters and when entered transport you to other parts of the ship. At certain intervals you can play a bonus game where you move your droid at the bottom of the screen shooting poles moving down the screen.
