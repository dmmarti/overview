Amazon is a graphical text adventure game by Michael Crichton. You work for the NSRT (National Satellite Resource Technology), a top secret research firm. Waiting for a transmission from a team sent to the Amazon Rainforest, you realize the expedition has gone wrong, and it is your job to travel to the Amazon Rainforest and figure out what happened. The game features three difficulty levels, timed sequences and action-based mini games. Included in the folder is a map of the Amazon rainforest and a technical briefing of your mission from the NSRT home office.
