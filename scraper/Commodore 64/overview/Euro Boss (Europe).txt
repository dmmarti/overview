PlayStation Store Description (from Ad Blurbs) Create and evolve the meanest (or funniest or coolest) princess-eating monster in this humorous frantic-action game and show it to the world! Boss is a frenzied virtual monster game, where players assume the role of a gigantic monster attempting to destroy the magical kingdom. Once players have designed and given life to their creature, they will explore the quirky environments of Trogon Kingdom and fight hordes of brave heroes and powerful wizards defending each region. As you battle your way through Trogon Kingdom, you collect coins to buy items to customize and evolve your Boss. Princesses beware they are the monster's most favorite food in this fun, role-reversal game!
