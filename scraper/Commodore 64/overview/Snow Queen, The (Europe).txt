There is a looking glass which when looked through stops anything looking beautiful and makes anything ugly worse. The looking glass has smashed into pieces and scattered around the surrounding areas making it a ugly place to be. Based loosely on a fairy tale by Hans Christian Anderson, The Snow Queen is a text adventure where you play the role of Gerda who must find and rescue his friend Kay who has been struck by one of the pieces and has been spirited away to the Snow Queen. Both versions have text which describes your location and you type in commands to control your hero and interact with each location. The Commodore 64 version has graphics to let you see your location.
