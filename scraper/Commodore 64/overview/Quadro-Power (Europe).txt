Quadro - Power is a single screen game with simple mazes for one to four players and the aim is to collect all the dots and get the highest score you can over various screens. Each screen has pathways connected by discs with certain gaps in the discs, and each path is full of dots. You move Mr Quadro around the maze avoiding Spirit's and other creatures as you go dot collecting. There are also hearts and diamonds on the paths with the hearts giving bonus points and the diamonds giving set points. To change path you need to go into the disc and spin it 90 degrees to the right to move the gap but moving the disc one place loses you set points. The more set points you have the more you can turn the discs, but if you go into minus set points then you lose one of five lives. Touching a creature or running out of time also loses you a life and it is then the next players turn.
