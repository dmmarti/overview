Wait, you say, wasn't this an Infocom title Actually, this one came out first on the budget publisher Mastertronic's catalog. It's a vastly different game than the Infocom one - you wander around as one of a number of characters trying to build up your rapport with the people, doing battle and working your way up to becoming a shogun.
