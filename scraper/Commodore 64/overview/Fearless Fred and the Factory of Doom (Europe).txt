Fearless Fred owns a factory comprising of 16 rooms. His job is to collect parts that are found lying on the ground within a strict time limit. There is only one problem. Each room is infested with robots and other dangers, and Fred has no weapon he can use against them. The only thing he can do is jump over them. If he makes any contact with them, Fred becomes electrocuted and he loses one of his life. A built-in cheat allows the player controlling Fred to move up or down a room, but by doing this, the player is unable to enter the top three.
