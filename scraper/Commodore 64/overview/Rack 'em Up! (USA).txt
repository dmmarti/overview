IDSI's Rack 'em Up! is a top view single screen pool game for one to four players, with a choice of four types of games, 8-Ball, 9-Ball, Straight and Rotation pool. If more than two players then it is two against one or two against two as you try to beat the other players or try to get the best score in solo play. All the normal rules of pool are included for foul balls and the games you play involve: 8-Ball: The balls are split into two equal types, stripes and spots, and one black ball (8-Ball). The players try to pot any of the balls (except the 8-Ball) and when they do then that type of ball is potted by that player for the rest of the game and the other type by the other player. The winner is the player who pots all their type of ball and the black ball last. If the black ball is potted during the game then the player who potted it loses the game. 9-Ball: Nine numbered balls (1-9) are on the table and the player who is shooting has to pot the lowest ball on the table and each player keeps attempting to pot until the winning player pots the 9-Ball. Straight: Also called 14.1, the game has the players trying to get to a certain score by receiving one point for every ball potted without a foul. A typical score to play for is 100 points. A player must also call the pocket they want to pot the ball in. Rotation: The players have to get to a set score (usually 61) by first hitting the lowest ball on the table before trying to pot the ball with the highest score to receive that amount of points. The lowest ball on the table can be used to hit an other ball into a pocket.
