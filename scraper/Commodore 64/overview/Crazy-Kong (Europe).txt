Inspired by the arcade game Donkey Kong, Crazy Kong is a single screen platform game where you have to get from the bottom of the screen to rescue your girlfriend at the top over four different screens from a giant ape. On the first screen you must run along the platforms climbing ladders while avoiding barrels that the ape is rolling down by jumping over them. If you hit a barrel then you lose one of five lives but there are hammers that can be collected that smash the barrels for a short time. The second screen now has conveyor belts that carry pies and fireballs and these must be avoided or you lose a life. There are also items on the screen that can be collected for points. The third screen has two elevators that move up and down the screen and they must be navigated while avoiding objects that bounce around the screen. The final screen once again has platforms and ladders connecting them but now there are various rivets holding the screen together and you must run over the rivets to make them disappear while avoiding fireballs. Once all the rivets are gone then the ape will fall down to the screen to his death and the girl is yours. Once all four screens are completed then you start from the first screen again.
