Grab-It is a side view single screen game where you control a grabber released by yourself to collect Nadium Blocks to take back to your planet of Cort for your people's survival over six levels. At the top of the screen is your ship and below is the grabber you move around the screen to pick up one of the eight blocks of Nadium at the bottom of the screen. Once you pick up a block, you take it to your ship but there are creatures also on the screen that need avoiding. The first level has one creature with the further levels having various numbers of the creatures and if you touch one then you lose one of three lives. Once all the blocks have been collected then you move to the next level and you can select a level at the start of the game. Two players can play and each player takes it turn to play when the other player loses a life.
