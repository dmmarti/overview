Fernandez is a despot who has invaded the Republic of El Diablo, bringing terror to the local people. The rightful leaders of the country have called you in to destroy Fernandez's hideouts and bring his country back to the people. Fundamentally this is a Commando clone, scrolling vertically and with hordes of enemies to be taken on, with finding good shielding spots and launching surprise attacks an especially useful strategy.You have unlimited bullets and limited but collectible grenades to use. There are landmines to avoid, and medical packs to pick up. On each of the 8 levels you must destroy Fernandez's buildings, which are accessed through an underground network of tunnels. You're not limited to being on foot - you start off in a jeep and can also use motorbikes, tanks and similar, although losing a life destroys this. In 2-player mode you can split driving and gunning duties. When starting a new game, you always start from the point at which you died in the last game.
