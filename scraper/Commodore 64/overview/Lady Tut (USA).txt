In Lady Tut, you are searching underground for Lady Tut's sarcophagus. In order to do this, you must go through five mazes collecting all the rings that you can find while avoiding creatures that roam around. There are one or two doors leadng to the next maze, but each of them must be unlocked with the key found in the same maze you are in. Later, a gun can be obtained, and can be used to shoot creatures.
