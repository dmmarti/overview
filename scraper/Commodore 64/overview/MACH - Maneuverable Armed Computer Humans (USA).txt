An evil robot called Nektron has enslaved three planets and it's the player's job to take on the role of a Maneuverable Armed Computer Human and free the planets. The action takes places in multi-directionally scrolling stages seen from a top-down perspective. The goal of each of the three stages is to destroy a set number of certain types of enemies. Beginning with the weak Vacilators, followed by the more resilient and heavily armed Gyphons and finally, large mother-ships. There are many other types of enemies as well. They will sometimes drop power-ups that replenish energy or give access to more powerful weapons. The game gets increasingly difficult as the number of enemies that have to be destroyed increases and mother-ships start appearing several times throughout a level.
