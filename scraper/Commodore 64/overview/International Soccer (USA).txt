International Soccer is an arcade action soccer game. No league or cup tournaments available, only friendly matches (2 halves at 200 seconds) against a human opponent or the AI (9 levels of difficulty are offered). Corner kicks and throw-ins exists, but you can't play foul - so no yellow or red cards required. The game is played with the joystick; with your joystick you control the player of your team (7 against 7) next to the ball (your teammates will be controlled by the AI). Push the fire button to pass or shot, you can move to all eight directions. You only see about a quarter of the playing area on screen which automatically scrolls to the left or right. If the ball comes near to your own goal, you get automatically control over your goal keeper - hopefully you can do a brilliant save: after a save the goal keeper needs some time to get back into action, be fast enough to help him with your fielders.
