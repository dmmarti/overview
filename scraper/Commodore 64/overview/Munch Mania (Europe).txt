Munch Mania is a single screen maze game based on the arcade game Pac-Man where you move Munch Maniac around a maze to eat all the devil dots. While you eat the dots you are chased by four ghosts and if you touch a ghost then you lose one of three lives. There are four flashing senior devil dots in each corner and when eaten allow you to chase and eat the ghosts for a short period of time. Occasionally a fruit will appear and when eaten give you bonus points and a level is completed once all the dots are eaten and you then play the same maze full of dots again.
