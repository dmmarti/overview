Bumble Bee is a top view single screen maze game where you play the role of a bee and you have to collect all the pollen on the screen to move to a box marked OUT to go to the next level. There are two types of walls on the screen and they are red and yellow with red walls able to be turned to pass through them while yellow walls are solid and cannot be moved. As you move around the screen there are toadstools and fireballs which must be avoided but there are points to collect for bonuses. A bar moves along the right, bottom and left of the screen and when it reaches the top of the left side then a spider appears. The spider has to be avoided but he can't turn the red walls so you can make him hit the fireballs to kill them, but toadstools have no effect. The bar grows again when the spider appears and when it reaches the left again then another spider appears. If you touch a spider, toadstool or fireball then you lose one of three lives.
