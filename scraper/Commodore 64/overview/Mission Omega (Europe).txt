Omega is the codename for a mysterious alien craft which has appeared in space, armed with potentially destructive missiles. Your task is to reach it, and then disable its four reactors and escape within a hour - this way it can be explored, and its technology exploited, without it firing a missile or falling into enemy hands. You do this by guiding a robot droid through the corridors and rooms which make up the ship. You control the game using an icon system, and your first task is to configure the robot with the weapons and power supply you feel will be the most effective. Rather than individually directing each move, you can use the inbuilt map to plot a course for the robot.
