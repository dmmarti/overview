The Equalizer is a side scrolling single player platform game. The player controls a small baby-like character who can move left and right, jump and who shoots blobs of goo from his navel. The object of the game is to collect all the fruit on a level. trying to prevent the player achieving this are all kinds of nasties like snails, lizards, bouncing jelly fish like things, and birds that drop things from above to name but a few. Contact with any one of these costs a life As if this were not enough the levels contain many jumps that have to be timed just right and just to keep it interesting the landing platforms are often populated with the aforementioned beasties. As the player progresses through the levels the game becomes harder and the character evolves - eventually becoming the Equalizer.
