Crazy Comets is a single screen shooter inspired by the arcade game Mad Planets where you control a spacecraft from behind at an slight elevated angle and you have to blast and destroy heavenly bodies over various levels. The Universe is in chaos and out of control with all objects moving on erratic paths and the only way to save the Universe is to destroy all objects. The heavenly bodies move around the screen and moving in various directions, you keep firing a large amount of shots until they are destroyed. You must avoid touching them because if you do then you lose one of three lives. When a body is destroyed then another one appears until all on the screen have been removed. On later levels, comets and lost space capsules appear and the comets have to be destroyed as well but the capsules can be collected for bonus points. Two players are able to play and each player takes it in turns to play when the other player loses a life.
