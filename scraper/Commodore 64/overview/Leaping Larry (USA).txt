Leaping Larry is a flick-screen platformer where you play the role of Larry, a caveman who has been given the Chief's daughter to marry. Before your wedding day though, she has been kidnapped by a tribe of cannibals in the next valley, so you have vowed to rescue her. You must traverse through underground caves avoiding obstacles and creatures to reach a key on each screen to move to the next one. You have the ability to jump and crouch and there are also other cavemen who fire arrows at you and if you hit any arrow, creature or obstacle then you lose one of three lives and have to start the screen again.
