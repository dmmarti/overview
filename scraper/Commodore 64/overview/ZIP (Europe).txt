You are the pilot of a space-craft and you have been sent to the five brother worlds of Alpha Centauri to destroy all the aliens there. You must fly over each world and shoot as many aliens as you can who come at you in waves. To help you are giant letters on the surface and when shot give you power-ups that include extra speed, smart-bombs and lives. If shot or you touch an alien you lose one of 3 lives. ZIP is a vertically scrolling shoot-em-up viewed from above. You use a joystick to control your craft.
