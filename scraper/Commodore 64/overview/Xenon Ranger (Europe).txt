Xenon Ranger is a combination of a shoot-em-up and platform action where the aim is to reach the grade of 'Xenon' as a copter pilot within a time limit. The main playing area is split into two with the shooting section on top, the platform section on the bottom. You start with the shooting section which is horizontal side scrolling and moves left or right when you move your copter. There are other copters trying to shoot you and deplete your energy with the loss of three lives so you have a cannon to shoot them back. Your aim is to collect one energy pack at a time and take them to the entrance to the underground cavern. When you collect two you can then transfer to the platform part of the game as you leave your copter and walk about on foot. Here the screen scrolls when you move and you can move up, down, left or right as you explore. There are baddies and obstacles to avoid so try not to lose one of three lives. A joystick is used to control both sections. As well as the main playing area you can see your score, lives, Energy Packs collected, time gauge and energy gauge.
