The Ormus saga looks very similar to the early parts of the Ultima series. You live in Barryland, which has been taken over by the Ormus cult and now you have decided to do something about it. The quest starts near the city of Remfield at the southwest shores of Berryland. You can create your own character or simply start with the premade one and when you start the game you will be near a hostile town. You have very limited troops available at the start so attacking at this time is of no use. Around the world are treasures you can find to finance more troops and there are other places of interest as well like temples, castles and villages to visit. Along the way you will face monsters you can fight for experience and gold. The ultimate goal is to destroy the Ormus cult in their stronghold. The controls are keyboard based and doing things like entering a town and besieging are done using a menu system. The Ormus saga differs from other RPG's, as it also contains troop battles during a siege of a town or castle.
