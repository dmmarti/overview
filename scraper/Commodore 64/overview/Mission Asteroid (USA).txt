In this game, you play an astronaut who is asked by Mission Control to send a rocket up to an asteroid and blow it up before it reaches Earth. The trouble is: you will be unable to find the asteroid without a flight plan. This early adventure game is very short, and, in order to accomplish the task, the game requires you to enter one- or two-word commands to perform various actions. The game may be saved to a floppy disk at any point in the game.
