In this futuristic arcade-action 2D-isometric-looking game you slip into the role of the DECEPTOR on your quest to discover what your elders have set forth as your destiny. They taught you the way of transformation, your able to assume 3 forms helping you to master your quest. In-game you have to navigate the terrain of each of the 4 corridors and avoid its dangerous inhabitants. Whenever you want you can transform into a land vehicle or a air vehicle to reach higher platforms of the corridors. Each time you touch the ground with the air vehicle you will be automatically transformed into the land vehicle (by pressing the fire button of your joystick you can transform between land or air vehicle). At the end of each of the 4 corridors stands a gate and you will be forced with an guardian in order to pass to the next corridor. You have a limited amount of time to reach each gate. Reaching a gate at the end of an corridor will automatically transform you into your 3rd form: A humanoid. Shoot at the guardian and hit him several times to destroy him. But you don't have unlimited ammunition, to increase your ammunition you must pick up units of it while you advance through a corridor. Beware of the deadly inhabitants willing to kill you and be fast enough to reach the gate to the next corridor within your limited time window. Should you be able to conquer all 4 corridors, you will realize your destiny and assume control of your future!
