Master Blaster is a top view vertical scrolling shooter where the screen scrolls upwards constantly as you control your spacecraft and blast the enemy ships. You are Mart Blane in the year 2156, interstellar superhero with the title of Master Blaster as you save planets and aliens from evil all over the Universe. After the successful mission saving the planet Xoptex, you are on your way home to Earth passing through the dangerous Galaxy, Xenprime when you see a damsel in distress being pursued by Pirates and you vow to rescue her. Problem is that is a trap to imprison you, and the damsel is actually Vanda, the evil Empress of Xenprime, with the aim to get you out of the picture while she goes and destroys Earth. In your spacecraft, you have managed to escape your prison and now your mission is to blast the enemy and save Earth. You are able to move around the screen and you must blast or avoid the various enemy ships as well as the ground defences and if you are hit by a weapon or object then you lose one of three lives.
