After all your hard training, it's time for your final test to become a sorcerer. You have been transported into an enchanted cottage and your task is to find out what's behind the green door in front of you (it's not Shakin' Stevens). Also in the room is a coloured cube that when opened will allow you to transport to three different locations. The Enchanted Cottage is a text-only adventure. The screen describes your location and allows you to type each command via your keyboard to solve each puzzle.
