The location of Spore is a laboratory in which hazardous spores are cultured. Unfortunately there was an outbreak and soon the spores will infest places outside the lab. The only way to stop them is to use use all the available antidote on them - but the canisters are inside said lab... So the player's mission is to travel inside the non-scrolling levels to collect all canisters. With his hand gun he can kill the spores which attack him - but they are replaced by a destroyable spore generator. Helpful are extras which can be collected in the levels: flasks regenerate life energy and pills can be activated at any time to drive away spores for a short time. Other special fields are earth (can be destroyed by the player or the spores to pass) and impenetrable barriers (which can be deactivated and sometimes are reflected by mirrors).
