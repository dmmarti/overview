Welcome to this version of 8-ball pool. After picking the number of players (1 or 2), number of frames (1,3,5,7 or 9), colour of the table and if playing the computer, your opponent. Enter your name(s) and it's time for a game. The table is viewed from above and takes up the majority of the screen. At the top of the screen are a few options. Line up the shot, spin, strength of shot and reset the game. Occasionally a man with a big nose appears to update you on your game and a small man appears over the pocket the computer is aiming for.
