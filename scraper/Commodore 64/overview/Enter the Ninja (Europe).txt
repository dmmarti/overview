Enter the Ninja is a basic game by Mastertronic created using "The Games Creator". A white-robed ninja must kill other ninjas that make their way erratically across the screen, while avoiding their shurikens and nunchakus. Occasionally, a ninja runs across the top of a brick wall and throws shurikens which also must be avoided. A life is lost when the ninja has made contact with other ninjas or their weapon, and the game ends when all lives are lost.
