Big Business, stripped down to the bare essentials: Make lots of money in this turn-based management simulation by buying companies and selling the goods they produce. Invest is all about, well, investment - fresh cash flows directly into new businesses, new shares and new company improvements in a never-ending cycle of productivity. Up to four human players can compete for market dominance; the computer takes vacant places. Whoever amasses the most money or builds a monopoly in one of the six business areas (from pharmaceuticals to space engineering) wins. Tension rises as hired saboteurs and spies infiltrate companies to cause maximum damage - unless they are caught by a detective on guard. Invest is a German game and was never published in any other language.
