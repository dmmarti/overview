The Payoff is a single player text adventure. There are no pictures in this game. The player takes the role of a gambler who likes to bet but isn't very good at it. Consequently he owes lots of money to the New Jersey mob in the form of Luigi. There seems to be only one way out of this predicament that doesn't involve lots of pain and a premature demise - rob a bank. The game has a text parser that accepts two word commands and is entirely keyboard controlled.
