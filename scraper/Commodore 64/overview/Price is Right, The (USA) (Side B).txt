GameTek's home version of the classic game show The Price is Right. Bob Barker and the Beauties are not present, but a multitude of pricing games from the show, as well as the wheel and the showcase, have been faithfully replicated. Four (or a maximum of eight, counting both rounds - the programme suggests switching players) contestants can play, with the computer filling in for the rest. Whether bidding on Contestant's Row or playing a pricing game, contestants will attempt to closely guess the price of an item provided. All items in the game are often-unintentionally-humorous misspellings of recognizable brand names, to avoid trademark infringement. Pricing games include the Mountain Climbing (in which your 3 guesses must be less than $300 away in total, otherwise a goat will push you over the edge), Safe Cracking (in which you have 3 possibilities for each part of the price, and must correctly guess it) and the Dice Game (in which you accept or reject random rolls to get the real price). There is a persistent Hall of Fame with winners and their scores, and a parser for guessing/bidding prices. Players have to type in their price guesses, and answer to the math of how off they were, as they would if they were on the show.
