Blitz 64 is a one-key arcade game, similar to Air Attack. You are the pilot of a light bomber aircraft. You are running out of fuel, and your only hope is to flatten the city to enable your aircraft to land. Bonus points are awarded for landing, or for obliterating King Kong while he is climbing a skyscraper. It is a one-key game, which means you cannot steer the plane, you can only drop bombs by pressing the spacebar (or joystick button). The plane moves from left to right across the screen, slightly descending every time it wraps back to the left side. The lower the aircraft flies to more urgent it becomes to target the highest skyscrapers. There are two extra gameplay elements compared to 1979's Air Attack. The first is a big gorilla that walks from right to left, it will climb any skyscraper that is high enough provided that it is isolated. You can only bomb the big ape when it is climbing a building. Secondly, there is a big white cloud floating around, but it does nothing except obscure the view of your plane when you fly through it, making it harder to target the buildings below.
