This was a free game released by Activision to celebrate and promote their newest game, at the time, Zork: Grand Inquisitor. It is a text only adventure done in the style on the original Zork games. The year in 1066. You're a private, 7th class, in the Inquisition Guard. After getting relieved of your post at the Port Foozle Inquisition Gift Kiosk, you see the Pastor of Disaster, the Minister of Sinister, the Grand Inquisitor. It looks like he has a job for you. Yes, you. After asking about other, ANY other, guards to go instead, you have your orders. Sigh. Very well. Archaeologists have unearthed a tunnel that seems to lead to a new section of the Great Underground Empire or GUE. You are to enter this tunnel and explore the Great Underground Empire. You'll be back in no time. You hope.
