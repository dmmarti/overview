Bojo the Clown is performing at a circus, and must impress the audience by bouncing on a series of trampolines to launch himself in the air. Doing so will allow him to get a balloon or two. Once one has been collected, the same one appears somewhere else and Bojo must jump on a different trampoline to get it. While collecting the balloons, he must also be on the look-out for spears which approach him from both directions. If Bojo gets skewered or misses a trampoline, he will lose a life.
