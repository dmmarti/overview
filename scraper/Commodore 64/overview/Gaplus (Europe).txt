You control a ship that must shoot down a number of enemy ships that attempt to kill you with bombs and kamikaze attacks. After you have destroyed all ships on screen, the next level begins. While you are shooting down ships, you also have the opportunity to shoot down the queen ship when it shoots down. Doing so will emit a beam at the front of your ship, and this beam can be used to capture enemy ships, and make them work for you, therefore giving you double the firepower. Occasionally, a challenging stage appears, and the object of these is to destroy three groups of enemy ship appears before all the groups disappear. For each ship destroyed, you will form a letter that makes up the word BONUS.
