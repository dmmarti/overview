Fungus lives on a floating island in space living a peaceful life with one problem, the only food he eats is mushrooms and they are found on other islands nearby. The problems with these islands is that they are full of various creatures who don't like their mushrooms being taken and the fact that Fungus can't stop running while on them. You control Fungus with the game viewed from the side at an elevated angle with the screen scrolling constantly from left to right. You can move up and down the screen as well as jump over gaps while avoiding the creatures and obstacles as you collect as many mushrooms as you can. If you touch a creature or obstacle, as well as fall of the island on the edges or in gaps then you lose one of four lives and back to the start of the island. Before you play the game there are various options that can be selected and you can select an island (1-7), a choice of four creatures that you must avoid, the difficulty (1-3) or the colour of the islands. You use a joystick to control Fungus.
