Rockwart the Troll has cast a spell on Daisy, leaving her asleep for 100 years. Dizzy sets off to put this right in a compact and concise arcade adventure following the conventions of the Dizzy series. You start the game trapped underground, thanks to the results of an errant spell, but can find your way out to explore the castle and find Daisy. There are stars to collect along the way, as well as food to replenish energy lost in contact with the many hazards. Succeed and you and Daisy will ride off into the sunset together.
