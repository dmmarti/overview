Nearly 5 years before Rebel Assault and other fully-rendered CD-ROM titles popularised the rail-shooter gameplay, Tynesoft used it for a game with an unusual setting. You are on board a roller coaster which has been layered with targets to shoot out. The roller coaster follows its natural path, swinging from side to side and up and down, while you aim a turret at the targets and shoot them out. After completing its cycle, the roller coaster reverses, moving through the same area moving backwards. A co-operative two player mode exists, in which each player controls a crosshair. Make sure to hang on as the ride turns.
