The Gemstone saga continues in Gemstone Healer, the sequel to Gemstone Warrior, where you braved the horrors of the Netherworld dungeons to recover the pieces and restore the Gemstone to its rightful place in the Temple. Now, to your dismay the Gemstone has lost its powers because the pieces have been damaged and you must return to the Netherworld to locate the healing tools and heal each part. Then you can fuse all the pieces together into a complete working Gemstone.
