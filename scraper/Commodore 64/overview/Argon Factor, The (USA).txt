It is the year 2152 and you are Captain Cord, Commander of the Space Fleet, and you have been searching the universe to clear your name from an incident that wasn't your fault. A space bandit called Valdira, who roams the universe destroying everything, has decided that your career and life should be destroyed. Valdira made a holographic image of yourself and used it to send your fleet on to a dangerous mission in which they never returned. The real you was arrested and found guilty and your punishment was to be banished from Earth forever. Three years later with your trusty robot named LAP, you are in the Velusian Belt and passing a small planet called Argon. You start to receive a signal from the planet, mentioning the name of your girlfriend Ankira who was on that fateful mission. You land on the planet and start to search for the missing fleet as well as evidence to clear your name. The Argon Factor is a graphic text adventure with text on the screen describing each location you are in with an occasional picture showing what you see. You type in commands with the keyboard to interact with your surroundings and the game is played in real time as you search the planet. The game is split into two parts, the first part has you searching the planet for evidence of your innocence while the second part has you searching for your girlfriend by solving various puzzles.
