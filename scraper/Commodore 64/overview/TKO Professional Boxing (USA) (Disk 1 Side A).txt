In TKO you can play the career of a boxer. Create your boxer by trading off a mixture of attributes, for example a boxer who cuts easily will not tire as easily, and a boxer whose best punch is to the head will not punch to the body as efficiently The main 1st-person perspective view shows the faces of both you and your opponent, including progressively injured faces as you land punches. A small overhead view helps you see when you or your opponent are close to the ropes.
