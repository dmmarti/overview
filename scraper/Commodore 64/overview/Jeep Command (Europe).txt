Based on the gameplay of the Arcade game Moon Patrol, you have to drive a jeep back to your base through enemy territory. The game is viewed from the side and the screen scrolls constantly as you jump obstacles, and shoot grenades and other items. You are able to speed up or slow down the jeep and the faster you travel the higher you can jump with the ability to control your direction in the air. Hit an obstacle, gap or a weapon and you lose one of five lives and sent back a certain distance. On screen there is also a map showing how much of the territory you have completed.
