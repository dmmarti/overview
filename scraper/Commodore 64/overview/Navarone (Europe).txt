Navarone is a single-screen shooter where you move a M.R.S.22 One-Man Submarine around the screen to blow up four Heavy guns at the top of the screen with torpedoes. You are part of an invading force but with the guns in the way, you have been tasked to remove them so your colleagues can complete the invasion. You start at the bottom of the screen loaded with two torpedoes which can only be fired a certain distance from the guns. As you move upwards, mines move across the screen from left to right and have to be avoided. Once you have fired both torpedoes then you must move back to the bottom of the screen to re-load. Once all the guns have been destroyed then you start again and after a couple of screens are completed you then move to the next level where the guns actually fire back at you. If you hit a mine or get shot then you lose one of four lives. Before you start the game you can select your starting level (1-9).
