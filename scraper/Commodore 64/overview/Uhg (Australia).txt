Uhg the Caveman is hungry and has decided to explore the dinosaur caves in search of the five eggs, then bring them back to the surface. The cave comprises of four levels, with the eggs on the lowest level. To get there, Uhg climbs down a series of vines. While searching, he will encounter small dinosaurs which must be killed with the club Uhg carries around with him at all time, and the dinosaurs take more than one hit to kill. Only one egg can be carried at a time, so multiple trips are necessary.
