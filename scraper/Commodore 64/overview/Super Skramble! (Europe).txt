Super Skramble! is a clone of Konami's Scramble. It is a single player game in which the player flies a craft over hostile terrain and through cave systems shooting enemy craft, bombing ground stations and avoiding missiles. The objective is to achieve a high score with the three lives that are available. Only one bomb can be on screen at a time and the players fuel, which runs out rapidly, is replenished by destroying fuel dumps. There are eight different kinds of terrain to negotiate as the game gets progressively harder.  The game has a high score feature and can be played either with the keyboard or the joystick. There is no save game feature.
