You are Davy: King of the Wild Frontier, and your gal and all your clothes and equipment have been taken by the pesky Injuns in this side view flick screen game where you have to get from the left of each screen to the right. On each screen is a piece of clothing or equipment on the right and you have to get a half-naked Davy to each one. As you walk across the screen, an Indian will appear and throw arrows or tomahawks and you must duck or jump to avoid them or if you are hit then you lose one of three lives. Further into the game you will encounter rivers with a log moving across and you must use this to get across or you lose a life if you end up in the water. Once you manage to rescue your girl then you repeat the screens again but this time there are snakes and cactus that need avoiding.
