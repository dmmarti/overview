Thor has completed his Quest for Tires. Now he must discover the Meaning of Life. But it won't be easy. The Meaning of Life is hidden away; somewhere in a long maze of mountains. Each mountain is covered with clams and Thor needs to gather 100 clams in order to pay the tolls and advance through each mountain. The only way to Peter and the toll bridge is through the real scary caves. There are lots of clams in the caves but watch out for stalagmites. Keep Thor's headlight sweeping back and forth for maximum clams. Out of the cave, watch out for Grog, who saves clams from Thor. Thor also has contend with rocks, potholes and pterodactyls (they'll eat his wheel) in his Quest for Clams and the Meaning of Life.
