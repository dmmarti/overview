In his previous adventure, Berk had to complete tasks that were given by his master, the Bad Tempered Thing, and had to deal with his creatures that lurk from underneath the Trap Door. Now one day, Berk, along with his friend Drutt, decided to explore his domain by going through the Trap Door. You take control of both Drutt and Berk, swapping between them with the fire button. They need to solve a series of puzzles and deal with new creatures along the way. There are four regions to explore, and opening locked doors give access to later regions. Scattered throughout the regions are sweets and toadstools which, when consumed, will provide Berk with special characteristics. Progress is made by using the two characters together, as Drutt can reach places that Berk cannot.
