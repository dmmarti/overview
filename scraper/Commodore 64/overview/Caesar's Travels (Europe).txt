Caesar's Travels is a game mainly for children age three to nine, and starts off where Caesar the Cat left off. After being kicked out by Mr. McGregor, his owner, for smashing too much crockery in the kitchen pantry, in an effort to catch mice, Caesar is placed in the yard and must find another home to go to. Throughout the game, a series of choices appear and one must be selected with the function keys. The story being told varies depending on what choice the player makes. For example, the player may choose to climb the fence or jump onto the wall, or climb a mountain or walk along a path. More often than not, Caesar is faced with a problem-solving question that usually requires the player to count the total number of items on the screen, and what object can they see on screen. There are 38 routes through the game and 18 different endings, all happy and non-violent - a point in the game's favor.
