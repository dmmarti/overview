Earth in the year 5112 is no place to live anymore. After countless wars with each other, alien invasions and the extinction of all other life with the use of all materials, the remaining humans are having a hard miserable life living in Government shelters. After the last war with aliens all the defences have been destroyed and with the lack of money, manpower and materials, new defences won't be built and with an alien attack imminent the humans have decided to leave the planet in a huge carrier looking for a new planet. After months of searching with nothing found and in desperation it has been decided to travel through Dimension F which very little is known about. You play Captain Paul Squires and you are a pilot of a spacecraft which flies over the carrier in various sectors protecting it from any alien attackers Starforce Nova is a top down horizontal scrolling shoot-em-up that scrolls from left to right constantly and is based very loosely on the game Uridium. You must fly over the surface of a part of the carrier shooting or avoiding alien fighters as well as any obstacles sticking up from the surface. Hit an alien fighter or briefly hit an obstacle then part of your energy bar decreases and when it is empty it is game over. Hit an obstacle hard or get caught between it and the end of the screen then it is game over as well. Once you reach the end of the carrier, the screen just wraps-around and you fly from the start again. After the second fly over you have a bonus run. Some letters appear and you must shoot them in the right order for a password that allows you to move to the next sector. Hit them in the wrong order or fail to shoot all the letters and you must fly over the carrier twice more again. A joystick is used to control your ship.
