RDF 1985 is the sequel to Germany 1985 and is the second game in the When Superpowers Collide series. The game is a strategic simulation of a conflict between the forces of the United States and the Soviet Union. While the battle rages in Germany, Soviet paratroopers land in the Middle East to capture strategic oil fields. The United States responds by sending in the Rapid Deployment Force (RDF) to recapture the oil fields. There is only one scenario. Victory conditions are simple: the player controlling the greatest number of towns and oil fields after a certain number of game turns is the winner.
