You're a robotic insect, leading a normally happy life in your robotic jungle, when some of your robotic cousins decide to chew through the nearby citadel. Unfortunately for you, they're threatening to chew right through the reactor core! Capture renegade insects to stop their damage, and use them later to perform tasks for you.
