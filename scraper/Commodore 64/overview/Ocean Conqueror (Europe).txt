As a submarine pilot within a war, your task is to destroy enemy munitions convoys in your sector. There are eight destroyers and four transports to destroy, within a time limit of 18 hours. You are armed with torpedos and guided missiles (upon firing one, control inputs are applied to the missile, rather than the ship). You also have a long range radar and a static map with co-ordinates. Controls are complex, with the periscope and rudder coming under your direct control.
