The planet Osmium is home to the evil Rexillian Blitztroopers and your mission is to fly over the surface of the planet and destroy them all. In this horizontal side view shooter that scrolls from left to right constantly, you have to shoot as many aliens as you can or avoid them over various levels. There are various obstacles that need avoiding as well and if you touch an alien or obstacle then you lose one of three lives. Occasionally icons will scroll from right to left and if shot will give you better weapons but if you touch one then you lose a life. At the end of each level is a boss in the shape of a big ship and you must destroy it or avoid it as it moves towards you to go to the next level.
