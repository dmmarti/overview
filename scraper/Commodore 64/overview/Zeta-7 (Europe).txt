Your mission is to protect and to defend the Zeta-Class Defense Sphere #7 from an attack from enemy attack ships in this 1st person perspective shooter. You are in control of a Solar-Powered Positron Accelerator and you must move your sight 360 degrees around your pod looking for any enemy craft to destroy. Any enemy ships that appear will attempt to destroy Zeta and your pod by firing missiles. You must use your sight to destroy the ships as well as any missiles fired. Yourself and Zeta both have a status of green and multiple hits will change this from green to yellow then red before being destroyed and game over. Your pod also has solar panels to give you energy but if these are destroyed then any movements decreases your energy.
