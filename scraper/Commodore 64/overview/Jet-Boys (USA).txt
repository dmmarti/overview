The discovery of rich mineral deposits on Saturn's moons has made our solar system one of the most hotly contested areas in the galaxy. An evil despot has bought one of the moons and installed a powerful reactor. Unless he is given control of all the moons, he threatens to blow up the reactor, irradiating all the minerals and making them worthless. Enter the Jet-Boys, an elite security force protecting the Saturn system. Armed with their jetpacks and laser guns, they must now face the despot's organic and mechanical minions, enter his space fortress and destroy the reactor. Jet-Boys is a horizontally scrolling scrolling shoot 'em up. The player takes control of a Jet-Boy and must destroy wave upon wave of enemy warriors across four levels. Power-ups fly across the screen allowing the Jet-Boy to upgrade his weapons, shields and gain extra speed. Every enemy destroyed counts towards a timer. At the end of each level, a boss enemy must be destroyed within the time limit gained during the level. The can be played by two players simultaneously, each controlling one Jet-Boy.
