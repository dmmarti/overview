You are a professor who has built a time machine and you have been asked to save the world with it by searching through time for a golden key that the evil Time Warrior has stolen and returning it to its proper place. To use the time machine, you need to find coloured keys that will take you to various places like a caveman era, deserted space station and Medieval England. Once the golden key has been found then your mission is complete and you have saved the world. Adventure in Time and Space is a text adventure where text on the screen describes your location and you use the keyboard to type in commands to interact with your surroundings.
