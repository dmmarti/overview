Bat Attack is a Galaxian clone, in which you control a ship that must constantly move left and right firing at a series of bats that swoop down with your laser, while avoiding their bullets. The bats swoop down until they fly off the bottom of the screen and re-appear in the group. One of your lives gets lost when one of these bats come in contact with the ship. Once you have wiped the bats out, you must then avoid the spinning discs that come down the screen. When you have avoided enough discs, the next level begins.
