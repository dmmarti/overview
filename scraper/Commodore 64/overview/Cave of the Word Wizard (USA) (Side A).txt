I am the Word Wizard. Welcome to my cave. You, as Mark or Becky, have been trapped in the Word Wizard's cave. You must wander about, avoiding hazards, while trying to find magic crystals within the cave. Find enough magic crystals to escape. Using the joystick, you move your character left or right. Pressing the button makes you jump, so as to clear boulders, pools or snakes. You can use pits to get to lower parts of the cave or jump them. You will use ladders to climb. If you hit an obstacle, except a pit, you will use a Band-Aid. Use all your Band-Aids and the game is over. At times, the Word Wizard will appear and ask you, verbally, to spell a word. You will use the keyboard to spell the word. Spell the word correctly to continue. Spell the word wrong and your flashlight will lose power. You will then be shown the correct word and must type it in to continue. As you play, your flashlight slowly loses power. Lose all power and the game is over.
