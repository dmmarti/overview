Super Nibbly is a Snake-variant where you control a worm in a maze, eating pills while growing. The game is a successor to the previous game by the same developer, Nibbly '92 The game starts with an overview map, where the snake moves on a path on a group of islands, going from location to location while having some non-interactive funny animation events on the way. At each named village, the game switches to a maze screen where the player can control the snake. The mazes are similar in layout as the pac-man style maze, a fixed single screen, only without enemies. The objective is for the snake to eat all pills/cookies in the maze, before returning to the overhead map and moving to the next location. The player controls the snakes movement one step at a time, and there is some strategy involved in navigating the mazes, while there also is a timer ticking down. The rules are that the snake can move forward, or to the side, and avoid being blocked by its own body from moving anywhere. Eating a pill makes the snake grow one segment longer. There are special objects appearing in the maze for a limited time, that can affect how the snake grows (longer/shorter) or giving extra points or a time extension or special object called a 'puck'. In some locations there are dead-ends, which if entered could trap the snake, but the snake can shoot a puck (which looks as if it split off its head) into these locations, and so get all pills in the dead-end. Each location has multiple mazes to traverse before the player returns to the overhead map. Failing to avoid the snakes own body, loses a life, and the maze restarts anew. Failing three times and it's game over.
