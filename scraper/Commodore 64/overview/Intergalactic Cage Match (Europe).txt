Cage Match is a single screen one to two player wrestling game where the ring is viewed from an elevated angle set in space as you attempt to beat five other fighters from across the universe. At the start of the game you can select your fighter as well as your opponent and the idea is to climb to the top of the cage that surrounds the ring. You have various moves that are controlled by joystick combinations and as well as kick and punch you can headbutt and throw your opponent. You are able to climb the cage at any time but if your opponent is still able to fight then he can shake the cage to throw you off. Both fighters have a energy gauge and every hit taken decreases it and when it reaches red then that fighter hits the canvas. You can kick your opponent while he is down and when he isn't able to get up then you can climb the cage to win the fight. After the fight you can select another fighter and select another opponent.
