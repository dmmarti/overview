In this budget Breakout-style game use your bat to hit the bouncing ball in an attempt to destroy a wall of bricks. Each wall cleared moves you to the next colorful level. As the game progresses alien enemies appear which can be destroyed with your ball, though interfering with its path. Use falling pickups to enhance your bat's abilities, adding features like speed-up, lasers, and level jump.
