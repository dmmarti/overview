The year is 1997. You're piloting an AH-64 Apache helicopter through enemy city streets on search and destroy mission. Your target: the Strategic Defense Computer (SDC). You must weave your way in and out of skyscraper corridors. That's the easy part; but enemy helicopters and tanks dog your path -- you must destroy or be destroyed. If you root out the SDC in all three cities, you can save the world from complete nuclear destruction.
