Supercuda is a single player Pac Man styled game where the object of the game is to achieve a high score. The game has all the expected elements. Instead of playing as Pac Man the player takes the role of Supercuda the fish, instead of ghosts there is a different selection of deep sea predators on each screen, instead of power pills there are electric eels and so on. The game is entirely joystick controlled.
