You are a one man army and you have been tasked to sail to an island, take the island before finally taking a fortress containing a mad General who has invaded with his army the island and is now planning more invasions. The game is set over seven stages and you must complete each one to take you nearer to your goal. You have a power bar and on any stage you are shot or bombed you lose part of it and when it is empty it is game over. You also have to be careful with your ammo as it decreases every time you fire. Your power bar and ammo stay the same for all seven stages and you can't get more. The game is set to a clock and your high score is based on your time at the end of a game. The stages are played with a joystick and involve the following: Battle at Sea (Stage 1): You are sailing on the ocean and the enemy have sent out gun-boats to stop you. The stage is viewed from above on one screen and you fire a gun at the front of the boat while enemy boats sail past vertically upwards. You must destroy five as they shoot you to move to the next stage. Behind the Cannon (Stage 2), Closing in on Island (Stage 3): The view switches to a 1st person perspective with the island in sight on one screen as you fire a cannon at three ships on Stage 2 and three cannons and a ship on Stage 3. You can move the cannon left or right and pushing up or down with the joystick increases or decreases the length of your shots. The enemy will fire bombs at you with some missing and some hitting. Enter Island (Stage 4): Viewed from above with the stage viewed on one screen you can see your ship and a landing-craft on the left of the screen. On the right is the island with two gun-placements top and bottom on the beach. You must move your craft to the centre of the beach while avoiding the bombs fired from the two gun-placements. Fight Them on the Beach (Stage 5), Watch out for Ambush (Stage 6): Now you are on the island you must get through two stages to get to the fortress. Viewed from a 1st person perspective with the stages on one screen you must shoot any soldiers that pop up and after shooting a set amount you move to the next stage. Like Stage 2 and 3 you can move your rifle left and right and move it up or down to change the length of your bullets. Attack the Fortress (Stage 7): The final stage and you have reached the General's fortress. The stage plays exactly like Stage 5 and 6 and once you have shot a set amount of soldiers they surrender and you have won. The game ends and you can see your final time before playing the game all over again. On each stage, as well as the main playing area you can also see ammo, power, stage time and your overall time.
