Dragon's Kingdom is a side view scrolling game with platform elements, inspired by the arcade game Ghosts 'n Goblins, where the screen scrolls in various directions when you move your hero Darius. Your land, Thalax has been plunged into darkness by the King of Demons, who released evil demons from the Swamp of Soggoth when the King turned himself into a Griffin. The King of Thalax, Duncan has chosen you to traverse across the land over three levels to destroy as many demons as you can before destroying the King of Demons. As you walk along the land, you are armed with an unlimited amount of swords that can be thrown, as you avoid or shoot the demons that move around each level. There are ladders that can be climbed as well as bridges and platforms to navigate as you avoid obstacles like fireballs and lava. There are also bonuses that can be collected along the way as well as chests that can give you a new weapon like an axe or fireball. If you hit any demon or obstacle then you are thrown backwards and are invincible for a short time. If you touch a demon or obstacle again then you lose one of four lives and moved back to a restart point.
