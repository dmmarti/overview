3D Golf, not to be confused with the Hole in One series from HAL which shares its UK title, is a golf game with one 18-holes course. To perform a shot, the player chooses the kind of club, the strength and the direction. It is important to consider the wind direction. When near the hole, the game displays an additional, smaller window with the hole and ball position for better aiming. Besides playing the full course alone, there are a training and two-player mode available.
