Viduzzles allows you to do jigsaw puzzles on your computer in either a 25 or 50 piece puzzle, with outlines or no outlines. You are first presented with the picture you have to complete before you are presented with an empty square and the pieces needed to complete the puzzle. You move the pieces into the square and you try to complete the puzzle in the quickest time. Once completed you then move to the next picture.
