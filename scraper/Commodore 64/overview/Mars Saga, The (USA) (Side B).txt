You're a stranded space jockey in a rugged frontier settlement on Saturn's moon, Titan. Your one chance to get off this ice cube is to assemble a team and find... a lost city! This early Westwood title is a turn-based RPG set on the surface of Mars. Your characters have attributes and 21 skills that can be raised during the course of the game. You gather your party throughout the game. Much of the game is viewed from a first-person perspective with a small top down map and status line, but combat is all top-down. Combat can be handled directly by the player or left to the AI.
