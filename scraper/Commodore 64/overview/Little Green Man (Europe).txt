You are the King of the Little Green Men and you have just escaped from your captors but you are now stranded on this strange alien world. You play the role of the King as you attempt to meet up with your spaceship in this scrolling platform game where the screen scrolls when you move. There are various creatures and hazards that need avoiding and if you touch any then you lose one of three lives. As you progress you come across check-points and when you die you start from the last one you walked through.
