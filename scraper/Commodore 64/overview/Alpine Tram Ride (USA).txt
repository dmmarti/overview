Alpine Tram Ride is an educational game designed to teach logic and problem solving. The game presents the player with a tram containing four cars; each car is occupied by one of ten animals, and the player's goal is to determine which animal is in which tram car. On each turn the player selects four animals and places them in the tram cars; the game will indicate whether any chosen animals are correct and if any are placed in the correct location. Since the game doesn't indicate which of the four chosen animals are correct the player needs to figure this out. The game ends when the player chooses the correct four animals and places them in the right location. The game keeps track of how many turns are taken, the goal is to solve the puzzle in as few turns as possible.
