4th and Inches is an action/strategy football game for one or two players. You control the action during the variety of plays that can be called, choose when to take timeouts, and select which players on your team will be on the field. There are two teams (the All-Pros and the Champs) and you can see each players statistics to determine how fast or strong he will be.
