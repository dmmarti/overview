Yie Ar Kung-Fu follows the quest of a martial artist named Oolong to become the Grand Master of Kung-Fu, honoring the memory of his illustrious father. To do that, Oolong will have to face some of the most skillful martial artists in one-on-one battles. The battles take place on side-view screens. The hero has two moves at his disposal: punching and kicking. These moves must be executed by pressing a corresponding button together with a directional button or arrow key. Oolong also has the advantage of being able to jump higher than most of his opponents. The latter utilize unique moves to stop the hero, including sumo-style leaping motions, shuriken-throwing, nunchaku-swinging, etc.
