Megawarz is a single screen shooter where you control a Cyclonic Megawarz Uniship Mk1 in various directions as you attempt to get to Earth by warping from planet to planet starting with an attempt to get to Pluto first. You can turn in a 360ï¾° direction and thrust forwards, and when not thrusting you slowly will come to a halt again. As you move around the screen there are various aliens also moving around the screen and they must all be destroyed to complete a warp. If you hit an alien then you lose a life and have to start the screen again. Each planet takes a various amount of warps to get there with Pluto only requiring one. As well as your laser you also are equipped with a shield which means the aliens can't destroy you but this is limited and a bar decreases when in use. Astronauts floating in space make an occasional appearance and when collected give you bonus points and increases your shield bar. Once all the required warps are completed then you can play a bonus screen where you have to collect all the astronauts on the screen before they mutate and the mutated astronauts need to be destroyed to clear the bonus screen but no life is lost if hit. Before you start a game you can select the number of lives (3, 4, or 5) and the difficulty level (1-5).
