Avoid the snakes, arrow-shooting man, porcupines, condor-dropped eggs and, in later levels, fire and eyes in the forest. Get to the top of the mountain and get the spear. Throw the spear at the condor before he gets to the child at the base of the mountain. You receive points for spearing the condor and avoiding arrows and eggs. You lose a life if you touch (or are touched by) a snake, fire, forest eyes, or porcupine, are hit by an arrow or egg or if the condor gets to the child at the base of the mountain.
