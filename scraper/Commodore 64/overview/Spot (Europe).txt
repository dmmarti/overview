Spot is an unofficial implementation of the board game Connect Four. Players take turn placing tokens on a 7 by 6 grid in an attempt to get four in a row, but unlike Tic-Tac-Toe tokens may only be placed at the bottom-most available spot in any column. The game continues until someone has four in a row (horizontal, diagonal or vertical), or the entire grid is filled. This version of the game only features two player mode, there is no AI to play against.
