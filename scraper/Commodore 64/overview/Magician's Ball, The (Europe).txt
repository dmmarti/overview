The Magician's Ball is a single player text adventure with graphics that features Mike Oldfield's Tubular Bells as in-game music. For reasons of plot line development a little girl has been turned to stone by an evil wizard. The player takes the role of Caro, a magician, and must slay the evil wizard in order to break the spell. Unusually the game allows the player to instruct other characters to perform actions and also has another character, Azul, that the player can become so if Caro dies it is still possible to complete the game.
