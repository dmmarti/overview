You are cryofrozen on a spaceship. Suddenly, you are awakened because aliens called Bogloids are attacking the vessel. The first thing you do is go get your proton beam. This proton beam can be used to kill Bogloids but the other thing it is for is to repair the holes the Bogloids created. Once the hole is repaired, your proton bream's power has been drained. This means you must get a new proton beam to continue your mission. You have a total of nine-hundred ninety-nine seconds to fix the ship and kill the invaders. If a Bogloid touches you, you die and the next astronaut in the cryofreezer is awakened. As there are three of you, that equates to three lives. If all lives are lost or the time runs out, then the ship will proceed to the planet Niblondis it was set for on automatic pilot and the Bogloids will then eat the entire population.
