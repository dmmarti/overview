The titular wizard has to rescue a princess named Fifi from a dark fortress where she is held captive by an evil emperor. The only way to reach the fortress is by collecting ten magic eyes scattered across four levels, and defeating the demonic guardians who will try to impede Willy's progress. Wizard Willy is an action game with platform elements. Willy can fire lightning bolts at the many enemies who intervene. The enemies are dangerous to touch, but don't fire back until later levels. Four icons are available to collect. One kills all monsters in the area, another gives an extra life, the third restores Willy to full strength at his current life, and the last restocks his lightning bolts. The levels incorporate forests (which include climbable trees), dungeons, stairways and fortresses.
