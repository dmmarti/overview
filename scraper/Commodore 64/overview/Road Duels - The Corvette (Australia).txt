Players control a Corvette that is navigating a busy road, using its built-in missiles to destroy car opponents, angry pedestrians, and choppers that circle around it. Scattered on the road are several money bags which award players point when they are collected. If the Corvette touches any of these obstacles, or crashed with the side of the road, the player loses one of their lives. The game ends when all lives are lost.
