In this ninja beat 'em up you take control of Kendo in a mission to retrieve secret documents which have been stolen. You have to fight your way through various guards and large dogs using your sword as well as kicks and forward-rolls. You must also go through several particle beams which block your path by collecting shields matching the colour of the beams. After usage the shield becomes exhausted and you must collect another one to advance. Other items such as a pipe wrench and wire-cutters can be collected to aid your progress. The documents are located in a safe which you must open by entering the code. Once in possession of the documents you must get to the roof and make your escape via helicopter to complete the mission.
