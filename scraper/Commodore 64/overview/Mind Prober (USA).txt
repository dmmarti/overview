Mind Prober asks users questions to rate themselves or other people on a series of 23 adjectives (talkative, pleasure-seeking, etc.), computes the results, and prints a three-page report describing the person. The questions for users differ by gender (male or female) and age (under 18, or 18 and older). The program comes with a thick manual-plus-book that contains many chapters on how to better understand people around you.
