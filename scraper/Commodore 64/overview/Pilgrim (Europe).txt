Legend has it that deep in a mountain in the land of Meridan lies a Guardian who is believed to be eternal and would provide help to the people in their darkest need. The Guardian is needed now as Silvian have invaded Meridan once again, destroying everything and killing people with new and strange weapons. You have decided to test the legend of the Guardian by exploring the lands ahead to find the mountain that contains the Guardian. You start your quest waking from unconsciousness in your destroyed room. Pilgrim is a text adventure where text on screen describes your location and you type in commands with the keyboard to control your hero and interact with each location.
