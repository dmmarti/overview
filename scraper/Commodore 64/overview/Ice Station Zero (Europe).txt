New York is being held to ransom for a Billion dollars by a terrorist group called Stirling. The location of the demands made have been made from a remote polar research station which has been taken by force. A huge attack on the station is out of the question so you have been tasked to get to the station, avoid the defences and put an end to the terrorist group. Ice Station Zero is a text adventure where the screen describes your surroundings and you type in commands with the keyboard to interact with your surroundings and objects.
