Combat Zone is a 3-player tank game. It is controlled by 2 players with the joystick and a 3rd player using the keyboard. Each round they are set up to shoot down each other in the battlefield. Power-ups appear randomly for the players to collect and at the end of each round, bonus coins can be collected and used in the shop after each round. The upgrades bought between rounds benefit the player for the rest of the game. The last player surviving is the winner. If the game is played single player, there are target practice rounds instead of a real battlefield with tanks.
