You are Oscar and you have just brought a new castle to call home, but as you explore the rooms you discover you are not alone. Demon Grell and his minions have also made the castle their home and they are determined to take your soul and make you walk through the fires of hell. In this flick-screen arcade adventure viewed from the side at an elevated angle, you must explore every room looking for objects to aid you in your quest to rid your home of the demons. As you explore you must avoid the demons as a touch will drain your soul and if it empties then it is game over but potions can be found to keep your soul topped up. Find any items and you are able to pick them up, examine them, drop them and use them which is indicated by icons below the playing area as well as any items carried.
