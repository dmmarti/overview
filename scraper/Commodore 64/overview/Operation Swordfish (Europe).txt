It's World War II and 1942, and the Allies are planning an invasion on the Mediterranean Coast with a great convoy of ships. Near the landing site though, are convoys of enemy ships and planes that will attack the invading fleet when they arrive. You are the Captain of a lone submarine in the area and you must destroy as many ships and planes as you can before the fleet arrive or you are destroyed. Operation Swordfish is a 1st person shooter with the action on the whole screen as you fire at planes with your gun and ships with torpedoes. There are two modes to the game which you have to keep switching between and they are gun mode and torpedo mode. In gun mode you control a gun that can be moved to the left and the right with the height adjusted as well. You use this mode to shoot down the enemy planes that arrive towards you trying to bomb you. If any ships are moving across the screen then you can switch to torpedo mode. You control a sight and line it up with any ship and you press fire to release a torpedo.
