Deadringer is a 1st person perspective racing game set in the future where you have to race an armoured skimmer on a ring made up of various parts to survive as well as compete against other competitors. The ring is made up of four parts with an inside edge and an outside edge, with the outside the most dangerous to drive on but the competitors can drive on any part they want. A timer counts down and you have to still be on the track when it reaches zero to win the race. As you drive various objects appear like walls, gates and mines as well as the other competitors but you are armed with a cannon which fires forwards and follows the ring. You can take so many hits but if you crash into an object then you lose one of three lives. A warp gate also appears which moves you to another part of the track.
