Panzers East! is a strategic level solitaire simulation of the German offensive against the Soviet Union which began on June 22, 1941. You as the German Commander direct the entire Axis invasion force but time is not on your side. You have a mere 24 weeks to take your objectives. During that time you must destroy the Soviet Army and capture the most territory with the lowest possible cost in Axis casualties. Each turn in the game represents one week of time. Victory points are calculated after 24 weeks and victory is determined by the ratio between Axis and Soviet points. The game is 1 to 3 hours long and is rated a 6 of 10 (intermediate) on Avalon Hills' complexity scale.
