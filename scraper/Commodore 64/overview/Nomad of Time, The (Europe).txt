Nomad Of Time is a single player real-time text adventure with graphics that is based on Michael Moorcock's trilogy of the same name. The game is set in a steam punk world of the future. The player takes the role of British officer Oswald Bastable and is in command of the airship H.M.S. Shards. There are two areas to this game, one is in the airship which must be flown to different parts of the world to locate temporal ports, the other is exploring the different locations.The game is played in 'real time', that is to say there is an in-game clock that must be monitored as the air ship has only sufficient supplies for sixty days and the game must be completed within that amount of game time. The game is entirely keyboard controlled and has a text parser that accepts two word instructions. While in flight the airship is steered with the left/right function keys.
