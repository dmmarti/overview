Gridder is a single screen game played over an 8 x 8 grid where you control a head and you have to fill in all the boxes to complete a level. As you move around the grid you paint the lines and when a box has been surrounded then it fills in. Scorpions also move around the screen and they must be avoided because if you touch one then you lose one of three lives. If you complete a level before the timer reaches zero then you receive bonus points.
