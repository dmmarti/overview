Super Password was a popular game show that ran from 1984-1989, and this game was adapted from that television program. Players give and receive clues to 5 Passwords which, when all are listed on the board, suggest the identity of the person, place, thing, event, phrase, etc., that is the Super Password. Each game consists of three to four rounds. The first round is worth $100, the second $200, the third $300, and the fourth (if necessary) $400. The first player to win $500 (or more) wins the game. The winner gets to play the Final Round for $10,000. To play the Final Round, the winning player must guess the ten Passwords as each one's initial letter is highlighted at the bottom of the stand. Each word is worth $100, but a special bonus of $10,000 is awarded if all ten are guessed.
