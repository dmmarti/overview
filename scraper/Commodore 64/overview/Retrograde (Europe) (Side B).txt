You are from the planet Choom in the Thwok solar system, which is under threat from a group of seven crazed dictators and their intergalactic war. Can you fight them all off in this fusion of side-scrolling shooting and top-view fighting First you fly along the planet's surface and atmosphere, complete with jetpack, shooting out enemies as they fly around you, and avoiding contact with them. You'll have to find planetbusters to gain access to the bunkers which contain nerve centres. Unfortunately, they are no use until charged up at one of the game's many shops, which is where the strategy element comes in. Shot enemies release credits, which can be spent on 12 powerful upgradeable weapons if you have any spare. These weapons can be sold to raise funds for improved weapons and charging. Inside the bunker you must cope without these weapons, fighting your way down to the nerve centres. Fortunately, your Powerfist can be upgraded in the aforementioned shops. Before you can reach the next planet, you must kill a boss within a time limit. This takes place in a 3rd-person view, fortunately with a full compliment of weapons.
