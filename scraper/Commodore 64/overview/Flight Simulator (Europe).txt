747 Flight Simulator allows the player to sit at the controls of a Boeing 747 Jumbo Jet airliner. The upper part of the screen consists of a simple external view (horizon, runway), while the lower displays the instrument panel (airspeed, vertical speed indicator, altimeter, artificial horizon, compass, turn and bank indicator, ILS, flaps and landing gear indicators, various dials for engines). After declaring the amount of fuel and the number of passengers, the player may attempt either a take-off, straight landing approach or random landing approach. The included map features Great Britain and contains 7 airports (Heathrow, Gatwick, Manchester, Birmingham, Newcastle, Edinburgh and Prestwick).
