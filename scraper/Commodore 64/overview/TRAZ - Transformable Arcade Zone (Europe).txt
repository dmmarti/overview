Transformable Arcade Zone is a Breakout clone with multiple paddles, 64 levels and a built-in level construction set.nnnnEach level can have different set of paddles, sometimes one at the top and one at the bottom, sometimes one left one right, sometimes four stacked-up etc. This gives each level a distinctly new gameplay.nnnnThere are unbreakable blocks, monster generators (also unbreakable) and glass refractors that change the balls movement angle as it passes through.nnnnAfter a level is cleared, the player must choose the next level by moving on a 8x8 grid of levels.
