Based on the movie. You control Bill and Ted- Rufus, a time travelling dude from the future, gives you use of a time-travelling telephone booth. Use the phone booth to go back in time to many different eras, collect items, and get historical dudes to follow you. Some dudes won't come unless you can bribe them with the right object. You must get them to follow you back to modern times so you can pass a history report and keep your band, the Wyld Stallyns together. At the end of the game, you are graded based on time elapsed, and dudes accumulated.
