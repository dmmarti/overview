Mr Speedy is a top down single screen game where you control Mr Speedy in a 90 degree direction, as you attempt to paint all the discs on a 7 x 6 grid within a time limit. To paint a disc you have to move on it but on later levels you have to move on the discs various times to paint it. As you move around the screen there are gaps which have to be avoided and you cannot go off the edge of the grid. Jelly Blob's make an appearance and these move across the screen and have to be avoided and if you touch one, run out of time, move into a gap or off the grid then you lose one of six lives. Two players can play and each player takes it in turns to play when the other player loses a life.
