Corporation is set in the future where big corporations exploit natural resources on planets, no matter the cost. The player leads a mining mission on an asteroid which is on a collision course to a moon. The player has to meet a certain mining quota until the crash occurs - and leaving the asteroid on time is also advised. This is a strategy game where the player purchases robots which do the work. There are six types of robots with different abilities, like mining robots for digging, survey craft to identify the crystals, trucks for transportation or fighting robots to attack the competing company (either controlled by the AI or another player). Those robots can be either equipped by fusion or solar drive: the latter is cheaper but does not work during nights. The player has a limited budget to work with and the robots can be either controlled directly (shown from a first-person perspective) or programmed to follow pre-set behaviour patterns. After finishing a round successfully, the player receives a code which can be entered for more credits and a higher quota to reach.
