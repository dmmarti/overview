As the good sheriff of Bandana County, your job is to collect enough gold so that you can marry the mayor's daughter. Stopping you from doing this are a wide range of enemies, such as hamburgers, video nasties, gophers, giant spiders, the Sitting Bull Bikers, telephones, monitors and more. Each day is split into two sections. The first section has you basically avoiding enemies while collecting money bags, which come in both blue and pink. The blue money bags you have to get, and the pink ones you have to avoid. If you try to get a pink one, then you will lose a life. The second section involves you riding a horse across the screen, while shooting enemies that get in your way. If a bullet comes in contact with an enemy, then it is stunned and returned to its starting position. If you come into contact with an enemy or touch a fence, you will lose one of your lives. Lose all of them and you are doomed to spend the rest of your days on Boot Hill.
