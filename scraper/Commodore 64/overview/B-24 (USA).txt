A simulation of WW2 air-warfare in which the player flies a B-24 as part of the 460th Bomber Group missions to Ploesti in Romania. The game operates on several levels, and the player will be required to act as a pilot, copilot, navigator, engineer and bombardier at different stages of each mission. The performance of your B-24 influences the effectiveness of your Group, Wing and ultimately the Air Force itself. B-24 is a simulator with a difference - you control your bomber (and the Group) from a top-down perspective rather than from a 1st person perspective.
