In Build-It: Das Bauhaus, the player takes the role of Joey, the construction worker. He won in the lottery, is rich and wants to fulfill his wish for his own house. However, he does not use his money to hire help, but does everything himself. This is a tile matching puzzle game. In every one-screen level, there is a number of squares which are divided into two differently-colored triangles. Joey needs to pick those squares up and create a new square of the same color in order to make the four blocks disappear. He can also turn a block on the spot. The goal of each level is to create a certain number of those same-colored squares. Of course there are a number of difficulties: walls may restrict Joey's movements, new blocks appear in fixed intervals and tools roam around the levels and kill Joey by touch. Helpful are three extras which give advantages when collected: a temporary protective shield, a level skip and all stones transform to joker stones (can be combined with any color). In multiplayer, two players alternate without interaction. The Amiga version has different levels and an optional time limit.
