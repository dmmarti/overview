The Rat is a top-view single-screen game where you are a rat spending the night in a cheese warehouse to eat all the cheese on various floors. On each floor are six cheeses with letters spelling THE RAT and all have to be eaten to open the entrance to the next floor. After you eat the first cheese then the others start moving around the screen. As you chase and eat cheese there are spiders and snakes that also move around the screen and must be avoided or shot to paralyse them for a short time. Touching a spider only paralyses you a short time but touching a snake loses you one of three lives. When there is one cheese left then an object appears and moves around the screen and cannot be touched or a life is lost. Eating a cheese with the letter E makes the lights go out, letter A opens up more passages, and the letter R removes some creatures.
