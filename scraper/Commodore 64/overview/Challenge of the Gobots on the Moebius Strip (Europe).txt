Challenge of the Gobots is a Defender variant based on the TV cartoon series of the same name (which is based on a toy line). The evil Dr. Braxis, with headquarter on the planet Moebius, wants to destroy earth and kidnapped some of their Gobot defenders and their human comrades. Now the player takes the role of Leader-1, the Gobot leader, to invade Moebius. Leader-1 transforms into his second form, a futuristic space ship, and goes on his way. There are two basic enemy forms to destroy: space ships are killed with the laser and earth-bound vehicles have to be destroyed by throwing rocks at them. Those are collected by landing and digging. The goal, however, is to destroy the enemy bases. To reach this goal, he needs to collect and use special bombs (clones of his sidekick Scooter) which are randomly divided over the planet. After finishing the mission the game loops with a higher difficulty, which can also be altered before starting a new game: the player can change factors like gravity or speed. The game also includes an electronic novel with the prologue and an audio cassette with the soundtrack.
