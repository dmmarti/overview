You are descending in the skimmer on the hostile planet to eliminate Harvester. But you may do this only in a skybike, which should be dropped down from the skimmer. The gameplay is flown in third-person perspective, while you are controlling your vehicle (skimmer or skybike) always flying forward. Moving left or right allows you to avoid the obstacles such as trees, accelerating and decelerating changes the speed, and shooting keeps you alive. Harvester is a boss, which appears after certain number of enemies will be eliminated, and it should be destroyed. Upon defeating the harvester the game awards the player with money, and loops back to the moment of time, when player controlled the skimmer. Collision with any obstacle means game over. Hi-score table allows you to see the most successful Skyrunners.
