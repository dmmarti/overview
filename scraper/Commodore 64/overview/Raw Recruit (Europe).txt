Anyone aiming to prove himself a soldier must prove his physical ability, reactions, stamina and sheer courage. As the Raw Recruit of the title, six events make up this challenge. To quality you must complete all six events, but you can continue the game to rack up as good a score as possible even if you fail to complete one. The first event takes place on a Rifle Range, with a requirement of hitting 16 targets to qualify; the later Pistol Range is similar but adds hostages.There are also Cross Country and Assault course events, involving running and jumping over hazards, and a Tug-O-War and Fitness challenges for pure strength and stamina testing.
