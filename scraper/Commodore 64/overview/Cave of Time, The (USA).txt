This is a multiple-choice adventure based on the first book in the popular Choose Your Own Adventure series for kids, written by Edward Packard. The Bantam Books publishing success sold 250 million domestic copies in the U.S. alone between 1978 and 1998, making it one of the most successful children's book series ever. In the game, you are a kid who enters the Cave of Time to recover four items stolen by the Time Grouches and must return them to their proper places and times. The items are: a golden crown, Abraham Lincoln's hat, the Loch Ness Monster's egg, and a piece of flint. When entering the cave, you can choose 3 options: up or down which take you to one of the 4 time periods, or go to the Time Grouches' lair where they will attack you two at a time. Using your sword you swing at them until you connect when their guard is down. If you defeat enough of them, you will get one of the required items behind 4 doors. When you go to each time period, you will have to correctly choose the proper actions in order to solve the required puzzle. You may have to go through each several times until you are able to get everything that is needed.
