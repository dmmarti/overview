Stuntman Seymour is a side-scrolling platform game. The protagonist, Seymour, as a stuntman must make his way through four movie sets with different themes. There are numerous enemies on each level, and collision with an enemy or its projectile, or falling into water causes Seymour to lose a life (he has 5 of them). Seymour can defend himself by shooting bullets that travel forward, or tossing bombs that fly directly upwards and then fall (there's a limited amount of bombs, but more can be collected on the way.) The levels also have score-giving items to collect. At the end of each level, Seymour fights a giant boss that jumps around and tosses bombs.
