Mental Blocks consists of three games: Free Fall, or Fits and Pieces, is a 3D version of Tetris. Instead of forming a line, you must form a complete layer before it will disappear. The California Achievement Cubes, or Mental Detector, shows you a cube, and challenges you to figure out which of the four unfolded cubes matches the cube. The single-player version has a timer, while the two player version has you pick the proper cube first. What's Next, Pussycat , or Shapes Happen, shows you three shapes, and asks you to pick the next shape in the series from a set of four choices. Again, you either face the timer or your friend.
