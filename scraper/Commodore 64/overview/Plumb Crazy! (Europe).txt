Plumb Crazy! is a single screen game viewed from an elevated angle where you play the role of George the Plumber who has to stop the pressure building up in a hot water tank over various levels. To do this, George has to lay pipes from a valve in the bottom left of the screen to the tank in the top right. At the bottom of the screen are six different shaped pipes and when George runs over one, he can lay down as many of that shape pipe until he changes shape again. As George lays the pipe, a bonus decreases as well as a pressure gauge increasing and when the gauge is full and the bonus reaches zero then the tank explodes and George loses one of three lives. If a pipe has been placed incorrectly then pressing F1 picks up a spanner and allows George to remove the pipe, and a press of F3 drops the spanner so George can pick up pipes again. Also on screen are boulders which the pipes have to go round but some can be removed with dynamite once on each level. Occasionally a Ghost of George's former employer moves across the screen from right to left and has to be avoided.
