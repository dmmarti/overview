The asteroids have been colonised and are protected in the Federation. An evil contingent of aliens have decided to wipe-out the humans. Unable to find out why this has happened the Federation sends Mr Andrew Angello to gather information of the attacks. One such asteroid EROC 1 has just had such an attack. A faint signal is still being heard so this means the Central Computer is still working. Mr Angello needs to find the bio-memory chips so that the plan of attack and alien armaments can be studied thus saving other asteroids in the future. You play Mr Andrew Angello and you have to walk around the caves beneath the surface of the asteroid over four levels. Although the aliens have left they have left booby traps and if touched saps the power from his backpack. When the energy is gone then Andrew will suffocate. Power can be replenished by finding batteries. Various pieces of equipment need to be found and to do this a spade has to be found so you can dig into the ground. Core is a flick screen side viewed game. The joystick moves you around while pressing down allows you to pick up objects or dig with the spade. As well as the main playing area you can see an information bar as well as directions you can go, time, backpack power and icons allowing you to save the game.
