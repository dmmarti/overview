Katakis was the first R-Type-influenced side scrolling shoot 'em up. You control the H-75 Eagle Fighter, against the machines which have over-ran a peaceful planet, with satellite and collect power-ups through 12 levels. Each of these has lots of parallax scrolling and some direct influences from films including Aliens and The Terminator. It can be played in co-op with one player steering the ship and another steering the indestructible satellite (C64).
