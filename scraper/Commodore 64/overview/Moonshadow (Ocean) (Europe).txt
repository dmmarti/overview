There's two moons around your planet. One is full of magical energy that keeps an evil snake at bay. One isn't, but it is about to eclipse the good moon, and cancel out the effects, thus releasing the evil snake. Fight and jump your way through the game finding items and solving puzzles, and single-handedly save the world.
