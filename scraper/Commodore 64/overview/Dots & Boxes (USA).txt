Dots and Boxes is a game based on a pen and paper game where you have to fill more boxes than the computer on a 6 x 6 grid made up of dots. Each player takes it in turns placing a line connecting two dots one place apart vertically or horizontally. To fill a square, a player has to place the fourth line to make a square which is then filled in and the players initial appears in the middle. Once a player fills a square then they get another go to place a line. The game is over once all squares are filled and the winner is the one with the most filled.
