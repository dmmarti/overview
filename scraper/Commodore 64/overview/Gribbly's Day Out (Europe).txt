Gribbly Grobbly is a Blabgorian, the most advanced species on planet Blabgor. He must rescue Gribblets, infants who have wandered off through this dangerous world. It is split into sixteen levels - apart from the first and last, these are played in a random order each time. Gribbly can blow bubbles, as a weapon. Levels are comprised of a giant Energy Web of diagonally-linked protective beams, parts of which can be disabled using switches. The web is to shield you from Seon, a rogue Blabgorian who uses his powers as a negative force. When there is only one Gribblet left, the barriers are released and Seon is free to chase you down. There are two initial types of active foes - seed pods (which move) and Chrysalis (which don't). Both hurt you on contact but are destroyed by bubbles. However, if Seed pods hit the ground they transform into Topsies (which can flip the Gribblets onto their backs, making them vulnerable), and if Crysalis are not destroyed quickly enough they turn into Stompers (which are indestructible and can kill Gribblets, but die on contact with water and are not intelligent to avoid it). When a Stomper kills a Gribblet, it becomes a Flier, which can re-release Gribblets - forcing you to quickly grab them.
