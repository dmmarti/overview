The year is 2029 and the evil Blubbermen have invaded earth. Only heroic Lane Mastodon can stop them, in a setting resembling science-fiction of the 1950's. Lane Mastodon vs. the Blubbermen is, along with Gamma Force in Pit of a Thousand Screams and the two ZorkQuest games, a part of the so-called InfoComics. The gameplay follows the same system as in the other games: the player reads text and views comic book panels (presented with CGA graphics in a vector format, including automatic zooming, panning, and rotating), occasionally being prompted to make a decision, thus leading the story into a different direction.
