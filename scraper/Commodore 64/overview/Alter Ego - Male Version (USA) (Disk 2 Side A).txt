Alter Ego is an action puzzle platformer. In this game, you control a hero and his phantom 'alter ego' that mirrors all your moves (either horizontally or vertically) from across the screen. You can switch between the hero and his alter ego a limited number of times in each level, in order to avoid enemies and reach inaccessible places. The aim of the game is to collect all purple and green boxes which can be picked up by a hero or his phantom respectively.
