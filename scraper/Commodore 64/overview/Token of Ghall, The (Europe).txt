Token of Ghall is a single player text adventure with graphics. The story starts, as many adventures do, in an old roadside tavern. One wild night a traveller joined a group around the fire and they exchanged tales. One old crone told a tale of the great king Ghall and how his kingdom had been swept away the hordes of invading dark things led by Lord Cthullo. Facing defeat king Ghall summons Ghunlh a long dead warrior. Ghall and the spirit of Ghunlh create a token that contains the spirit of the kingdom, the essence of all that was good in the world. After successfully hiding the token Ghall was captured and tortured but died without revealing its whereabouts. The crone ends her tale by challenging each one around the party, asking whether they dare recover the token and the traveller replied 'Aye!' Now, on the following wild night, the traveller abroad in the wilderness and alone. The game is entirely keyboard controlled and it accepts no shortcuts so the player must type 'Go east' in full rather than just 'E', an abbreviation which many other adventure games accept.
