Frosty's Busy Night is a pretty neat little competitive split-screen platformer where two frosties are racing against each other at the behest of some demented Santa. They have to pick up a present falling off a conveyor belt at the end of Santa's game of death, then reverse direction and come back through the course to bring it to him and score some points. You must avoid pits and obstacles or you'll immediately melt!  Repeat until one player can't take it any more, since it never seems to end or move on to another level.
The split screen makes this game best for two-player competition but you can play it solo score attack style as well.
