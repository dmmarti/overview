In this game, players control William Wobbler, whose object is to collect ten clues that are scattered through various caverns. To accomplish this task, players need to pass several barriers and puzzles. William's movement is controlled by joystick, with the fire button for jumping. Players begin on the surface of an alien planet dotted with craters that are used as entrances into the caverns. Collecting clues is not an easy task as a number of puzzles need to be solved and barriers to be overcome. William's inventory can be accessed with the [I] key, and it currently shows what object that he is holding. When an object needs to be used, it appears in William's hand and the process of using an object is automatic. Several obstacles including snakes, flying objects, and droids need to be dealt with. Snakes can be avoided by jumping over them and flying objects can be ducked under. One of the caverns has no droid and a Glowing Orb. When this is collected, any droid that William approaches is destroyed as the Orb materializes. Other objects need to be collected , but at most times, William needs to be in possession of a certain object before he can collect another. William Wobbler formed the basis of a competition around its time, in which a competition disk is supplied with the game. The idea was for the player to complete the game so that a special file is saved to the competition disk, then the disk was then sent to Wizard Developments. A prize was offered for the first player to complete the game.
