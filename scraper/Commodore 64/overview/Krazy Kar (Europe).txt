Krazy Kar is a top view vertical scrolling driving game where you control a car as the screen scrolls constantly upwards trying to bump or crush the other vehicles through four seasons. As you drive you can hit the other vehicles to make them hit the sides of the road or you can jump in the air to land on top of them for extra points. As well as moving left or right, you can control your speed and you need to go a certain speed to be able to jump. Some vehicles will drop oil and if you hit the oil or the sides of the road then you lose one of three lives. If there is an obstacle ahead like a river to jump then you get a warning sign as you approach and if you crash into the obstacle you also lose a life.
