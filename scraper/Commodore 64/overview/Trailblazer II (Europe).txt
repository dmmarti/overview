You have 24 levels to roll through within the time limit. Each level is composed of an assortment of squares with different functions - red slows you down and green speeds you up, black holes must be avoided, cyan squares temporarily reverse your controls, and blue squares trigger a jump. Aliens can be shot, but every other hazard must be avoided, as contact with them or falling into holes costs valuable time. Time left at the end of each level is added to the score. Hit the white blobs on the screen to earn credits, which can be used to purchase power-ups or tricks, which last only for the next level. Options include slowing down time, closing all black holes, deactivating the purple squares, and a shield.
