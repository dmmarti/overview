In this crosshair game you should shoot the gangsters appearing in the windows of the night city. You should move your aim in the directions either suggested or on your own to find the next gangster and shoot him as fast as possible. Other inhabitants of the building such as naked women, fat ladies, etc. are also present, and should not be killed. Each correct kill will give you points. Gangster may kill you if you will not be fast enough, and number of your lives will be decreased.
