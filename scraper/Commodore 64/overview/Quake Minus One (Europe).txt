The five sentient computers controlling the Titan power plant have gone rogue and will destroy it within an hour if they cannot be recaptured. Situated beneath the ocean on the mid-Atlantic ridge it poses a grave threat to both the coasts of Africa and America. Take control of the computers own 'mobiles' and use them to destroy or capture undersea tracks and installations until you finally reach the malfunctioning computers themselves. The Titan installation is huge and sprawling and the computers will work hard to defend themselves. The battle will not be easy.
