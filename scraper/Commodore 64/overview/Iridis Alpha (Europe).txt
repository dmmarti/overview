There is war on the planet Iridis Alpha between the Zzyaxian and the Gilbies. The Zzyaxian hate the Gilbies and want them erased while the Gilbies just want peace. The problem as well is that the Zzyaxian are stupid enough to want the planet destroyed so are stealing the planets energy. The Gilbies have now to fight back with the Gilby Robot Fighters (GRF) by killing the Zzyaxian fighters to get their energy. This can then be put back into the planets core. One unique characteristic about the Gilbies is they have a twin who live on the underside of the planet. Both Twins have to be alive for both to survive. Problem is that only one Gilby can be active and the inactive one slowly decays. Switching between GRF's is essential for survival. Once the core has enough energy then the Gilbies celebrate by playing their favourite sport Point to Point Racing. Iridis Alpha is a Horizontal shoot-em-up viewed from the side. You control the GRF with a joystick and to switch between GRF's you have to shoot a Zzyaxian who leaves behind a ring. You enter the ring without pressing the fire button to switch. The Point to Point Racing is a where you race up a vertical top-down scrolling course. If your tired or bored of the main games then you can pause the game and play a relaxing game called Made in France.
