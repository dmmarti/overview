The player must compete in a series of events against a human or computer opponent. Each event is difficult, with each one containing a variety of maneuvers that must be performed to allow progress. The fastest qualifying time in each event allows the rider to compete in the next one. The option screen allows up to four riders to take part, and three control methods can be used, with two of the methods relying on a joystick, and a third one with the keyboard.
