The Blibbles home planet is over-populated and so thousands need moving to another planet by cargo ship and as the Captain of the ship, it is your job to get them to their new home safely. Problem is, someone left their holding cell open and now the creatures are moving around the ship causing trouble. To make matters worse they are entering the engine room moving to a cargo transporter which is sending them to oblivion. You must use your scanner to move a Coerco-Stasis-Grille in their paths and transport them back to safety while avoiding rogue droids and a Wafoid. Mayhem is a single screen game viewed from the side full of platforms and lifts which the Blibbles will move around before eventually reaching the transporter. You must move a sight and pick up the Grille and place it in the path of each emerging Blibble in the bottom right corner. You can move the sight around but before a Blibble touches the Grille you must hold down the fire button to transport it to safety. As you transport Blibbles, Droids will start appearing and these can be shot with your sight because if they touch the Grille it will move back to the top left of the screen and has to be picked up and placed again. A Wafoid also appears and moves diagonally and can't be destroyed so your sight and Grille need to avoid it. Once ten Blibbles reach the transporter, then it is game over.
