Polar Pierre is a single screen platformer where you control Pierre and move him around the screen attempting to raise all the flags over various levels. As you move around the screen there are various obstacles that need avoiding like lighting, snowball-shooters and electro-generators. There are items though that help you get around the screen like springboards, lifts and bridge builders. You cannot fall too far downwards and if you do fall or hit an obstacle then you lose one of three lives. Once all the flags have been raised then you go to the finish and it's off to the next level. Two players can play with the 2nd player playing as Jaques and both players play on the same screen trying to raise their flags before the other player. A construction set was included with the game allowing you to create your own screens for others to play.
