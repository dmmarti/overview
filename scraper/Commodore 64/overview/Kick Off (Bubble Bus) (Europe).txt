Kick Off is a two-player table football simulator. Each player controls a team of 11 figures which are ordered on four bars for each one (1 goalkeeper, 2 defenders, 5 midfielders, 3 forwards). You can control only one bar at a time. The ball is kicked by rotating the figures on the current bar left or right. Game length isn't time-limited but depends on the total number of goals scored. After four goals have been scored players will switch side and the game will last until another four goals have been scored.
