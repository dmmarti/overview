The notorious Black Hole Gang caused Marshall McGraw a lot of trouble back in the old days, almost causing an Indian war before he caught them and sent them off to jail. But now they're free and up to their old tricks, kidnapping the daughter of the Indian chief in an attempt to start another war. In Kane II, it is up to McGraw to once again save the town of Kane, over the course of four stages. In the first, McGraw rides his horse alongside a train to shoot at bad guys, then he has a shootout with the Black Hole Gang at Fort Apache to rescue the Indian princess. Once he has done this, he tames his new bronco to be his new companion, and finally, he must escape the clutches of the Black Hole Gang and ride off into the sunset.
