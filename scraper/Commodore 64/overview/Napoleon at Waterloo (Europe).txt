Napoleon at Waterloo is a real-time strategy game which covers the battle of Waterloo (1815).The player controls Napoleon Bonaparte's army and has to defeat the enemy. At first glance, the game has the distinctive look of a wargame: a top-down map with abstract symbols representing the terrain and units. However, everything is in real-time and therefore the complexity has been toned down. The only thing the player does is giving move orders by choosing a unit and moving the cursor to the place it should move to. Those orders are not carried out instantly; each movement takes a certain amount of time depending on terrain and unit type. Battles are initiated automatically when a unit moves close to a hostile. Then they basically exchange blows until one unit lost all of its soldiers. The game also factors in fatigue and morale. The time is measured with an in-game clock and a match ends after eleven hours (30 minutes in real-time). If the player has won a match depends on the reached score which is based on the casualties.
