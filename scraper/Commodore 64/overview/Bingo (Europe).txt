Bingo is a gambling game where four to 100 players can play each other with four Bingo cards on the screen and the idea is to fill a card to win money. Each card on the screen is made up of a 5 x 5 grid filled with random numbers between 1 to 99 except the middle square which has the next number called. The computer calls a random number and if a player has that number on their card then they press any key on the keyboard to blank the number out but if the keyboard isn't pressed then that number stays on the card. Once a card has a full line either up/down, left/right, diagonal or the four corners filled then the player presses B to call Bingo and they win the money. If Bingo is called incorrectly then the game keeps going. Before each game the players can choose how much they want to bet for each game with each player starting with ﾣ100. The speed of the computer calling the numbers can be adjusted (1 to 5 on the C64, 1 to 4 on the ZX Spectrum). Each game has four lucky numbers and if they match the last four numbers called then an entry form is loaded and filled in with the cassette being sent off to the publishers. This is entered into a monthly draw to win ﾣ100 and a new copy of the game sent back to the owner.
