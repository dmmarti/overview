The realm of Deledain is divided into four major lands, each ruled by its own Lord. On an evil day, one of them, Lord Denethenor, became interested in the dark side of mysticism. He grew stronger and desired to control more than his share of Deledain. So he began to challenge the other Lords and the whole realm now lives in fear. It's up to the player to bring back peace to the four lands of Deledain. Wrath of Denethenor is a top-down fantasy role-playing game. The player travels the realm of Deledain by keyboard only, and can learn up to ten different spells, each with unique visual effects. The heroes explore several labyrinths and find the dimension doors, which allow them to travel between the lands of Deledain and help to fulfil their quest.
