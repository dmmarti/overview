KIDNAPPED! the headlines scream. The nation is paralyzed in shock. Is it possible?  The President kidnapped? Without a moments hesitation you know who's responsible - the Dragon Ninja. As Blade or Striker, a.k.a. THE BAD DUDES you take to the streets to rescue the President from his clutches.

But the Dragon Ninja is ready foryou. He sends wave after wave of relentless ninjas, vicious dogs, and enemies to stop you. Armed with knives, shurikens and numchucks you must fight tooth and nail in alleys, on waterways, even on moving semi-trucks. And don't think that once you've wiped out an advancing ninja horde you're safe. The Dragon Ninja has surprises up his sleeve. When you least expect it, you will find yourself face to face with any number of super monsters, and if you think you're BAD, they're really BAD.

In the end, if you're BAD enough, you take on the Dragon Ninja himself. You must defeat him and snatch the President from the helicopter that's about to whisk him away to who-knows-where. It'll take every skill you've ever mastered and a few new ones to be BAD!
