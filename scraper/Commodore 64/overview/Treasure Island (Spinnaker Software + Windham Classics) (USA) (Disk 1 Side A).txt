Treasure Island is a text adventure based on the novel of the same name by Robert Louis Stevenson where text appears on the screen describing your location while you type in commands with the keyboard to interact with your surroundings. You play the role of Jim Hawkins who has got involved with a treasure map and the hunt for the treasure on the aptly named Treasure Island. The hunt for the treasure is between two groups, Long John Silver and his gang of Pirates, and Squire Trelawney and Doctor Livesey and you have unintentionally found yourself part of the hunt. You have been left in charge of the Admiral Benbow Inn by your Mother after she takes your Father away for a rest after he fell ill. Billy Bones enters your inn and promises to pay you to keep an eye out for a man with one leg but he is instead confronted by two pirates one at a time, Black Dog and Pew with Black Dog being chased away by Billy. Pew, a blind man, was able to give Billy 'Black Spot, a summons which brings on a heart attack and Billy dies. With Pew gone and bound to now return with pirates you send a message to Mr Dance and his revenue officers, while you decide to keep look-out for the pirates and thus the start of your adventure.
