After a successful mission as a bomber pilot in World War II you are returning back to base when you are hit. Struggling with the controls in a burning plane, you parachute out as the plane crashes into the ground and you end up inside a barn on soft hay. After examining the wreck of the plane in enemy territory you decide to walk to safety but you are captured and sent to a prison camp. Not wanting to spend the rest of the war here you decide to escape from this camp. Escape to Freedom is a text adventure where the screen has text describing your location and you type in commands with the keyboard to interact with your surroundings.
