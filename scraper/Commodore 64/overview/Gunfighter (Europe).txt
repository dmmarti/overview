In Gunfighter you play a Wild West Sheriff, whose town is under attack from a group of outlaws who have taken the ownership rights for several homes. You receive warnings of the presence of a particular outlaw, and must patrol the streets shooting it out with them. The Doc's can give you an extra life, at a cost of $500. Red Indians and potholes in the road mean that you have to concentrate on more than merely the outlaws. You are limited to carrying six bullets - enter the Sheriff's office to gain more. A casino sub-game is included, allow you to gamble some of your money.
