Have you ever wanted to be a thief and break into buildings and steal treasures If the answer is yes then the game Security Alert is for you. The game allows you to get into five buildings which include a jewelery store, a museum, a bank, a research building and an embassy. Each building is more secure and bigger than the last. You need to find loot but the main aim is to find a certain treasure. There are many security systems in each building including cameras, robots and infa red beams. You have tools to do the job with as well as collecting tools on the way. Every time you are seen the alert goes up but lay low and the alert goes down. Don't lay low too long as there is a time limit. Get caught and it's game over. Security Alert is played by the joystick and keyboard. The joystick moves a cursor to various parts of the screen and clicking the fire button uses a icon or an action with your character. The keyboard is used for selecting actions quicker. The screen is split into five sections. The top left is the action part where you see your character and you are able to move him about. You can view this part as a top down view or viewed behind your character. The top right box is a memo showing your time and alerts as well as actions to move your character or change view. The bottom three boxes at the bottom of the screen shows an object and here you can use a tool on it, your inventory and a map of the building.
