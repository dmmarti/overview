Stellar Triumph is a shoot 'em up game that is exclusively made for multiplayer battles between two players. Each player controls a space ship that is viewed from a top down perspective and has controls similar to Asteroids with the player being able to rotate the ship and use thrust to move it forward or backward. The objective is simply to shoot down the opponent while avoiding any of the environmental dangers that can be added to the game. Each player has a limited amount of fuel and shots which when depleted prevents the player from shooting or moving. The game is highly customizable with a large number of options. For example the abilities of the ships and weapons can be modified. This include having inertia or not, the power of thrust and amount of fuel. Weapon options include velocity, rate of fire, amount of missiles and if it should fire single shots or have rapid fire. It is also possible to change how the space should behave and what objects should exist. One can choose to have a sun, a black hole or neither, how the gravity should work (negative, positive or none) and how strong it should be. Objects that can be added include asteroids, monoliths (which can be horizontal or vertical) and an alien ship. Another option is the screen setup where the player can choose wraparound (like in Asteroids), bounce back or Moebius universe.
