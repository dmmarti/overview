Widows Revenge is based on the arcade game Centipede and has you controlling a small craft at the bottom of the screen trying to shoot all the spiders that move about the screen advancing downwards. Your craft can move left or right and forward a small distance and also backwards, back to the bottom of the screen. Occasionally the spiders will stop and fire a web downwards and this needs avoiding. On screen are pods and eggs that can be shot or collected for points and shooting an egg will turn it into a pod. Other creatures that appear are a giant spider that moves across the screen laying more eggs and a bat flies around the screen. If you touch any creature or a web then you lose one of four lives and once all spiders have been killed then it's onto the next level.
