Darkness has descended on the kingdom of Beroth. The evil Tobias has summoned the Black Crystal in an attempt to get revenge on the Brotherhood of Wizards for refusing him entrance. With the Black Crystal in his grasp, he is able to bring down the kingdom. It is up to the player to venture through the many realms of the kingdom and recover the seven Rings of Creation, so that they can banish Tobias and his minions and destroy the Black Crystal. To do this, the player needs to get through six maps. The first map, the player must find some rings so that they can enter the castles on that map. While exploring the map, the player will encounter beasts which they must attack in order to continue. If they are killed, the player is returned to the sanctuary where he began the map. When you find the rings, the player is free to enter castles where they need to find more rings in the same manner. Some aspects of the game are in text adventure format, where the player is required to enter commands to proceed through the map. The final conflict is between you and the Lords of Chaos. If you win, the Black Crystal is destroyed and peace is restored to the land. If the player fails, everyone is doomed to eternity.
