Your job is move along the circuits of various 6510 chips in the Commodore 64 and protect 35 Base units from being destroyed by various creatures. The game is viewed from above with a part of each chip shown on screen and the screen scrolls when you move. You can only move along certain paths which form a maze of circuits as you try to destroy 20 creatures before the Base Units are destroyed to move to the next chip. You are armed with a gun and when you fire a bullet this moves along the circuit. As well as the creatures moving along the circuits there are fighters that fly over the chip but can only be destroyed when they cross a path. Other items to avoid or shoot are mines left behind by a Pulser and if you touch any creature, mine or bullet then you lose one of five lives. You are also armed with a smart bomb called a Hypercharge which destroys all creatures on the screen when activated. These are unlimited but require around 15 seconds to recharge between uses. If you manage to score 10,000 points an extra life is awarded.
