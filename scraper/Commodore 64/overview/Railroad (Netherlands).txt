The Railroad Works allows you to construct your own model railroad. Using scenery and shipping/receiving sites, you can make simple and complex layouts. Once you have designed your layout, you can run one or two trains on the layout. The game allows you to choose either steam or diesel engines and has five different types of rolling stock: boxcars, cattle cars, tank cars, passenger cars and a caboose. More challenging tasks include moving cargo and people around between sites and keeping to a schedule.
