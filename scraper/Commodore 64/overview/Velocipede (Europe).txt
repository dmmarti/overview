Velocipede is a side-view scrolling game where the screen scrolls from left to right constantly as you play the role of Mr Megafat who loves going to the beach to swim in the summer months, but it is half a mile away and he doesn't like walking. To get there, Mr Megafat has invented a bicycle, called a Velocipede S.T.A. (Simple to Assemble), but the problem is the road to the beach is full of creatures travelling the opposite way which cannot be touched. Luckily the bicycle has a plasma cannon and can also jump into the air to shoot or avoid the creatures like birds that drop fire and giant snails. If a creature is touched then the bike breaks and a life is lost but it can be rebuilt to keep going to the beach. In the middle of the screen is a counter which shows the distance to the beach and once the beach is reached then it has to be travelled to again with more creatures to attend to. Before the game is played there are various options that can be selected and they are speed (1-3), lives (1-9) and starting level (1-3).
