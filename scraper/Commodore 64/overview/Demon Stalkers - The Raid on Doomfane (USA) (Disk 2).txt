Demon Stalkers is essentially a Gauntlet clone. You must travel through 99 mazes, before meeting the final demon. The game features different enemies as you progress through the mazes, with clues to progression built in. There's a 2-player co-operative mode. The in-built level editor uses pull-down menus, and offers a high level of flexibility. As well as creating actual levels, you can create a integrated storyline and game world, as the text on scrolls can be edited.
