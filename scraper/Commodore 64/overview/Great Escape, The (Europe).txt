In the game you are a prisoner, who wants to escape and pass your way out undetected. First, you should collect the keys in your cell for a limited amount of time. Second, you should run undetected through the very long tunnel represented on several stages. Tunnel has gaps, and guards are walking on parallel ways. You should move yourself behind the walls in such way that any guard could not see you. When you'll be spotted, you will lose one of your lives.
