You are Fred, an intrepid archaeologist, interested in visiting the pyramid of Tootiecarmoon looking for a new experience, and in search of treasures and great adventures. The game consists of 6 levels, on which you must obtain treasures and - of course - a map that allows you to leave the labyrinthine pyramid alive. You must avoid dangerous acid drops, mummies, spiders, vampires, etc. In order to defend yourself from those disagreeable enemies you have at your disposition a gun (with limited bullets), but some enemies are immune to guns, and you must jump or avoid them.
