BMX Trials is a one or two player game in which the player competes in six cycling challenges. The challenges are a 200m race, pulling the longest wheelie, a ramp jump, a slalom course, 'bunny hopping' over bars, and jumping over a VW Beetle. The game uses a joystick to steer and the space bar or 'Fire' button to build up speed. The player(s) must complete one challenge before they are allowed to progress to the next.
