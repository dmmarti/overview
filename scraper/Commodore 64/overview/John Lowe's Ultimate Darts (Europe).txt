John Lowe won the World Darts Championship twice, and puts his name to this combination of darts-based games. There are 10 difficulty levels to take on. Only part of the board is on screen at a time, with the screen scrolling as you move the arrow from your perspective. This makes some targets much harder to hit than others. A practice mode is included, alongside standard 501 and round-the-board games, plus variants loosely based around soccer and cricket. In the former, the player who scores higher with each set of 3 darts gains territory (so in reality it's more like US Football). The cricket variant sees players alternate in batting and bowling roles in the former points are converted to runs; in the latter, hit the bullseye to get batsmen out.
