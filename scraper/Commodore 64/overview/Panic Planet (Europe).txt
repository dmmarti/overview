Panic Planet is a single screen platformer inspired by the arcade game Space Panic where you must rid various levels of a horde of invading monsters. Each screen has five levels with ladders in various positions connecting them with you on the bottom of the screen and the monsters on the top. To kill a monster you must dig a hole or holes and wait for a monster to fall in. You then fill the hole in to make the monster fall down a level and die but you only have a short time before the monster climbs out of the hole. You are able to fall through the holes to move down a level but you cannot go into a hole with a monster in it. As you move around the screen and kill monsters, an oxygen gauge is decreasing and all monsters have to be killed before it runs out or you lose one of three lives. Getting touched by a monster also loses you a life. As you progress through the levels you will find monsters that have to fall down two and three levels to kill them.
