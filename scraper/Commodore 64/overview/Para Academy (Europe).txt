Para Academy is a joystick-waggling game where you try to complete six different disciplines as a Paratrooper trying to rise through the ranks. The six disciplines all have various quotas that have to be met and once you complete the six disciplines then you are promoted and you attempt them again but harder quotas to complete. Completing one discipline allows you to shoot targets for bonus points within a time limit. If you fail any discipline then you lose one of four lives and you attempt it again. Two players can play with each player taking it turns to complete or fail a discipline. The six disciplines are: Sprinting: Viewed from the side with the screen scrolling from left to right you must run 100m within a time limit. Target Shooting: Viewed from a 1st person perspective on a single screen, you must shoot a certain amount of targets that appear in windows on a building within a time limit. Swimming: Viewed from the side with the screen scrolling from left to right you must swim 100m within a time limit. Weightlifting: Viewed from the side on a single screen, you must lift the weights a certain amount of times within a time limit. The Ropes: Viewed from the side on a single screen, you must run between two ropes and climb them a certain amount of times within a time limit. Tug-of War: Viewed from the side on a single screen, you must pull another person to the left of the screen before he pulls you to the right.
