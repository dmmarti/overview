To become a master you must enter the Dragon Temple and defeat various fighters spread over nine levels. You enter as a red belt and your ultimate goal as well as defeating all the fighters is to become a 5th Dan black belt. The game is a beat-em-up and viewed from the side with the screen scrolling when you move. You must fight each fighter one at a time and must defeat them to move to the next one. You have various moves at your disposal by pressing the fire button and holding the joystick in various directions. Moves include high kick, punch and leg sweep. You can also produce a bamboo stick to help you in your mission. You and your opponent have various bars and these represent various parts of the body and decreases when hit. If one reaches zero then either your opponent has been defeated or you lose one of nine lives. When you move up to a new level you receive nine more lives. One unique feature about the game is if you leave the joystick alone the computer plays for you until you press the fire button.
