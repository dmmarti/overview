Pilot 64 is a flight simulation that allows you to fly the 'Leander' Class 454 30 seat prop plane out of Norwich Airport at night. Before you fly you can adjust the wind speed (0-5) and how much fuel you want to carry (max 50 gallons) before looking at a map of the area observing the locations of the military air-zone and any other hazards. You have to take off, fly round the area and land back at the airport again. The game itself has you sitting in the cockpit looking out of the front window with the instrument panel below as you sit on the runway. There are many dials to observe and these are stall warning light, air speed indicator, artificial horizon, altitude, ILS, speed indicator, compass, turn indicator and the distance between you and Beacon A. You control the plane with the keyboard and this includes the speed, direction and height as well as the flaps and undercarriage.
