Halcyon is a variant of Roc 'n Rope in which the player has to navigate around a series of stages collecting coins while avoiding cavemen and dinosaurs who are searching for someone to eat. Unlike Roc 'n Rope, the player cannot use stun beams to stun them with, but must jump from platform to platform in an attempt to avoid them. If the player collides with an enemy or the bonus timer reaches zero, they lose a life, and the game ends when all lives are lost. Once the player has collected all the coins in each stage, they must reach a bird on the top platform that will transport them to the next stage.
