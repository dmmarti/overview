China Miner is a single screen platform game where you play Wally who is the only person to know the location of the Jade Mines belonging to the Pong Dynasty in China. On each of the 30 screens you must collect certain objects before collecting a key to move onto the next screen. As well as the platforms to negotiate you must also avoid the various creatures that populate the mine and if you touch any of them then you lose one of five lives, sent to the start of the screen and all objects reappear. There are various obstacles to avoid or use like lasers, moving platforms and platforms that disintegrate when stepped on. Falling from heights also lose you a life.
