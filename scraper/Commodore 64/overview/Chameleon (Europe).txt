The universe is near from collapsing because an evil person found the source of the elements and exploits it without caring for the consequences. The player has to take the role of Chameleon to set thing right by passing five levels; the first four based on the four elements fire, water, earth and air. The exact requirements for finishing a level change slightly over the course of the game, but the basic idea is always the same. Each level is shown from the side and scrolls both left and right. The player has to find two things: the hidden exit and a certain amount of power points. There are three days available to exit a level and the time of day (one of four states) is represented by the colour of the sky. This is important because the said power points have to be activated by being at the right place at the right time. Another requirement is to kill enough demons from each element which attack Chameleon. The way to achieve this is by switching between four missile types (each useful against a certain element) and shooting them. Being hit by a demon or running into other environmental obstacles causes the life energy to go down; refreshments can be picked up from killed demons.
