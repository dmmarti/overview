Fred Bear has decided to have a cheese sandwich for his supper. Eating it has made Fred tired, so he falls asleep. He starts dreaming that he is driving through Toyland, which is occupied by fluffy snakes, wooden ducks, space men, toy trucks, and several other inhabitants. Unfortunately, touching any of these toys poses a danger to Fred as doing so causes damage to his car, and if the car inflicts enough damage, it breaks down and Fred is sent to heaven. Fortunately, Fred is equipped with a nuclear honey pot and some balls of honey, which can be thrown at the toys to put them out of commission.
