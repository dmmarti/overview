The Kromazone is the elite training ground at the Terran Space Fleet Naval Academy. The fleet's best pilots are put through their paces here. Whoever wants to be a starfighter pilot and maybe one day fight against the Maranzar must survive the Kromazone. Kromazone is a 3-D game where the action is viewed from the cockpit of a MantaRay fighter, which automatically flies forward. In the first level, the task is simply to evade flying balls. Only when this stage is over, the fighter's blasters are activated and the enemy can be shot at. The MantaRay can take a certain amount of hits before being destroyed, and the remaining number is displayed on the bottom of the screen. The game can be played by two players taking turns, who can compete for a high score.
