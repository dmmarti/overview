X-29 Fighter Mission is a 1st person perspective shooter as you fly a plane into enemy territory to destroy the enemies base. As you fly into the screen you are able to move left or right with a radar showing your direction of travel. The base is invisible due to 10 beacons cloaking it and you must find and destroy all the beacons to be able to see and destroy the base. Trying to stop and destroy you are enemy aircraft and these appear one at a time firing missiles which can be shot or avoided but get hit by too many and it is game over. To locate an enemy aircraft you can hear beeps and the closer you are to the aircraft the faster the beeps go. Once destroyed then the next aircraft appears in your area.
