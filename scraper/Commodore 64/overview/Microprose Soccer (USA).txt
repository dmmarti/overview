	Arcade-style soccer game. It has two different parts- Indoor and Outdoor.    The Outdoor game is the normal European soccer. You may play single matches, league or tournament (world championships). Optional features are- weather effects, replays, customizable game length. Some quite funny movements and shots are available (e.g. banana flanks).    The Indoor game has US soccer teams (?fictional?) and plays on a much smaller field. It has different rules compared to outdoor soccer. You can play single matches, league and All Star tournament. The same movements and shots can be made, sometimes with even funnier effects (e.g. banana shot bouncing of the wall and into goal).
