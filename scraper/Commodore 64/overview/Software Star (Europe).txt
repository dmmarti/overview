An unusual simulation by the maker of Football Manager; here you manage a computer games company. Your task is -- besides making ï¾£10,000 profit -- to become a Software Star for ten successive months. Each game you produce has its own quality, depending on the amount of development. You can decide about the employing and firing of staff and managing their productivity. The game is sold in four regions, for which you can set different weights for advertising. For public relations, you can choose Honesty or Hype. The program takes seasonal factors into account -- for example, you'll always sell less in summer. At the end of each month, you can review a monthly statement to check your progress. After each year, the board of directors will check your progress -- if you did badly, you may be fired. The game has seven difficulty levels and offers the the possibility to save the game.
