Alice in Wonderland is an adventure platformer based upon the two Alice books by Lewis Carrol and created using the same engine as Below the Root. However, whereas that game had more of a focus on role playing, Alice has more of a focus on puzzle solving. Puzzles come in a variety of forms including many inventory based puzzles, and more appropriately, given the subject matter, riddles. Also, there are many physical puzzles primarily taking the form of how to get from here to there through jumping and using inventory items to change Alice's size. The plot is more inspired by the Alice books than strictly adapting them. Especially the game tries to adapt Carrol's sense of humor in its rhymes and puns. Interestingly, Alice's end of conversations are driven by selecting emotions rather than typing words, and it is possible to anger NPCs and have them stalk off, leaving you to wait until a pre-appointed hour when they will reappear. The time can be discovered by looking at one of the various clocks throughout the game. Time is important because the game must be completed before the Red King wakes, although this isn't much of an issue especially since the game can be saved whenever and mistakes easily taken back.
