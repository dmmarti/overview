You control the sports car in overhead scrolling view. The track represents a three-lane road filled with other cars, oil spots, and forward arrows. The cars in lanes are driving with different speeds lower than speed of your car. Accelerating, decelerating, and moving your car on the road, you should avoid the collision. Your car becomes hardly controllable for some period of time after you drive over the oil spot. The score is increased with the time of your survival.
