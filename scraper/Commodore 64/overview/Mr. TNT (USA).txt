Mr. TNT is an arcade game where the player controls the titular blobby character. The game is played on a grid and the player's objective is to collect sixteen stockpiles of dynamite. Lit fuses are also moving across the grid and the player has to avoid touching these or he will explode. The grid is removed as the player or the fuses move across it which means the player can't turn around and move in the opposite direction. It also means that he has to plan his movements to avoid reaching a dead end. The same is true for the fuses who will burn out when reaching a dead end. A level is cleared when the player has collected all the dynamite or when all fuses have been burned out. The player then moves on to another level with a different grid layout. Points are earned by picking up dynamite and for crossing grid junctions.
