A village is in big trouble with a volcano erupting and a river of molten lava slowly making its way down to destroy the village. The only person who can save the village is a wizard with the power of reversal but he can only be reached and picked up by the local witch. Problem is, the witch is under an evil spell and needs a magic powder to turn her back to good. It's now up to a monkey and an owl to cross various locations carrying a pouch of the powder that will save the village. You first control the monkey viewed from the side at an elevated angle, and his first task is to cross the black swamp but there is only one path and the only people who know are the leprechauns. You must lasso a leprechaun who will then walk along a scrolling screen using toadstools that appear and you must walk behind him. There are plants that need avoiding and birds that will try to break the lasso but a flick of the tail sends them packing. Once the swamp has been crossed, a bridge must now be crossed but the ravens don't like people crossing the bridge so you must throw stones at them to kill a certain amount in a single screen. Occasionally a cat on a broomstick will appear and he must be jumped over as he crosses the screen from right to left. Once the ravens are dead and you cross the bridge you then hand the pouch over to an owl. The owl must now fly above a scrolling acid lake, avoiding touching any creatures or the lightning from a storm cloud and once crossed you appear in a forest. In the forest you must avoid touching creatures once again in a single screen, and a snail must be prevented from crossing the forest floor. Once the screen is completed you can drop the pouch in the witches cauldron and she can now set off to the wizard and pick him up and finally save the village. If you touch any creature or obstacle in the game then you lose one of five lives and there are ten skill levels (0-9) that can be chosen.
