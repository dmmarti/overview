Crystals of Carus is a single player text adventure with pictures and music. Ereth, the evil Lord Death, was jealous of the royal family of Carus for they were greatly loved by their people. He resolved to do them great harm and concocted a powerful spell which turned them all to stone. The only way to reverse the spell is to locate the five magical gems that are scattered throughout the land. No one knew how to set about this task so the royal family remained as statues for years until a traveller, the player, arrived and vowed to undo this great wrong.
