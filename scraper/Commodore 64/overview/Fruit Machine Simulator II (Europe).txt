This is the sequel to Codemaster's Fruit Machine Simulator and is programmed by the same people who developed the original. It is a game for 1 - 4 players. Each player is given ﾣ1.50 stake money which is represented as a series of coins. These coins are fed into the machine by pressing the appropriate action key, zero feeds in ﾣ1 for example. Once the machine has been fed all the player has to do is spin the reels and see what happens. When a winning combination appears the game offers the chance to gamble it for a higher or lower win Some symbols have numbers on them. If these appear on the winning line they light corresponding number of letters in the MEGA-TREK feature. When all letters are lit the game activates the feature and the player can advance through the feature to higher winnings. Randomly the game will hold the MEGA-TREK lights from one spin to the next increasing the chances of triggering the feature. There are some reels with ' ' on them, these cause all the unlit lights to flash randomly and the player can activate the feature by pressing the action key when the last light is lit. The game also has many other standard features such as hold and nudge together with special features including Shuffle-Nudge box where you can shuffle the reels but each shuffle costs a nudge Winner-Spinner where the reels spin until you stop them to select the best win 4 Coin boxes
