Solar Jetman is a clever combination of shoot 'em up and adventure. It appeared on the NES first, and was going to be released on several platforms, including the Commodore 64. Unfortunately, Storm pulled the plug, but thanks to the guys at GTW (Games That Weren't), the (completed!) Commodore 64 game is available for download at several places, including your favourite C64 website, www.c64hq.com!

Jetman, who appeared on the ZX Spectrum in Jetpac and Lunar Jetman, is back for a sequel, and this time (being the mercenary he is) it's all about the lucre. You know... dough, green, ducats, wad, wampum, gravy... money.

The main game involves Jetman in a new small ship called a Jetpod. The aim is to thrust around in the Jetpod, picking up items. This is done automatically by flying near the item ? a tractor-beam is activated. Then you thrust back to your mothership. Beware, though ? items add to the overall weight of your Jetpod, so you'll be heavily ladened, making your thrusting a lot more difficult.
