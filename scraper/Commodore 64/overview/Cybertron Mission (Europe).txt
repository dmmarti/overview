Cybertron Mission is a top down game in which the player explores a maze of rooms to find various randomly placed items. Once found, touching a safe ends the level and starts the next level. Movement and firing are eight-directional. Touching a wall results in instant death by electrocution. Enemies generate in random positions when a room is entered. Linger in a room for too long, and Spook appears, a fast-moving creature that passes through walls, but can be temporarily stunned with shots. Each level is a maze of 4x4 rooms. In the first level, one item is needed and the player faces only slow moving Spinners. In the second level, two items are needed and unpredictable Clones are added, that shoot back. In the third level, three items are needed, and the Cyber-droid is introduced. The player starts with five lives, and is awarded an extra life at regular score intervals, on reaching a new level, and on collecting a potion.
