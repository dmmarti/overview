You are at the helm of the ocean ship Dawn Treader and must navigate through various hazards you encounter. There are storms, hurricanes, and sea serpents on your way to the islands. Once landed, your adventure will lead you to meet a dragon, invisible one-legged creatures, and more. Ultimately you will reach Aslan's Country and World's End and go on sub-adventures where you will use the cards and dice to see if you will be successful.
