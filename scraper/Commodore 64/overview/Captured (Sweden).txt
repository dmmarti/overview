After your exploits in Soldier One, you now find yourself waking up in an unknown large building unaware how you got here. Finding a note in your pocket telling you to find parts of a code to exit from the building, you set off to explore the building and escape. Captured is a flick-screen platform game where you must navigate various platforms while avoiding obstacles and creatures. If you touch any creature then you lose one of five lives but you can jump and fall from any height. You are armed with a laser and a bomb but the laser can only be fired three times and you have one bomb. More lasers and bombs can be collected further into the game.
