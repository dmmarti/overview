Time Travel is for all to enjoy and a company called Timeshare Travel allows people to go on time travelling holidays. The downside is that you have to use a year from your life and you do die younger but you will experience living that year you took from. Problems have started to arise that tourists are returning crippled or badly injured and your friend Jocasta, an academic suspects a Time Thief is responsible. Jocasta goes through time to search and confront the thief but doesn't return. It is up to you to travel in time now to find Jocasta and find and stop the Time Thief. Time Thief is a text adventure where text on screen describes your location while you type in commands on the keyboard to control your player. The game is split into chapters Shadows and Light, and Ironhand.
