With dynamically deformable terrain, proprietary next-generation graphics, realistic physics, and competitive bumper-to-bumper racing, Sega Rally Revo is a high-tempo driving experience that is every racing fan's driving fantasy. Vehicle selection affects driving strategy in Sega Rally Revo, as race course surfaces dynamically deform upon repeated contact with vehicle tires and changing weather effects. Sega Rally Revo features a variety of fully deformable surfaces, from gravel-littered tracks and smooth tarmac roads, to snow-covered mountain passes.
