The pixelated aliens are back to celebrate their 30th anniversary!  Taking a cue from other recent arcade classic updates, Space Invaders Extreme takes the gameplay of the 1978 classic, and reinvents it, giving power-up blasters, boss aliens, and an electronic soundtrack that plays in sync with the onscreen action.  Basic gameplay remains the same: Players guide a ground based cannon either left or right, blasting an oncoming fleet of invaders before they reach the ground.  The main objective is to get as many points as possible before running out of lives.  Space Invaders Extreme introduces new elements, such as invader fleets that break pattern from their left to right descent, boss aliens that require several hits to destroy, power-ups that enhance the cannon, allowing the player to wipe out multiple invaders at once, while racking up combos.  Wi-Fi play is also possible, allowing player to team up cooperatively, or compete against the other.  The Nintendo DS version also has a feature for online ranking.
