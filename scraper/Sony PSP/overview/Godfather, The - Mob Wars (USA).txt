Based on the 1972 film of the same name, The Godfather immerses you in the dangerous world of the Mafia. The game features GTA-style gameplay, a new storyline, and voice-acting by original cast members. Take control of the Corleone Family and make New York City your own. Intimidate and earn the loyalty of your peers as you battle the Tattaglia, Cuneo, Barzini and Stracci families. Engage in a turf war as you take over territory in the strategic Mob Wars mode unique to PSP.
