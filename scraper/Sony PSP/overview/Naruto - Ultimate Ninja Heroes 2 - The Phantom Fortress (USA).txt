In NARUTO: Ultimate Ninja Heroes 2: The Phantom Fortress, players take a custom party of four NARUTO characters through over 100 floors of the castle, experiencing fierce one-on-one battles, exciting minigames, and dramatic story twists in an all-out game of survival. Along the way, players will be able to power up each party member in a new character-customization system, equipping abilities and items to gain a decisive edge in battle. Updating the series' trademark fast-paced combat system, players will be able to pull off acrobatic flying attacks, flashy combo strikes, and unstoppable jutsu skills with ease.
