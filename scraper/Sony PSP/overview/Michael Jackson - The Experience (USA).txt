Michael Jackson: The Experience is a rhythm game that has players virtually dancing along with the King of Pop, on more than a dozen of his biggest hits. Players make their character dance by tapping the PSP directional buttons in time with the music, following on-screen cues. Routines are modeled after the artist's choreography, as seen in famous music videos and live performances, using a rotoscope-style animation technique to reproduce the actual poses and postures. As players master the routine for each song, it becomes unlocked in a jukebox mode that can be accessed at any time. The game has three difficulty settings, to challenge fans of all skill levels.
