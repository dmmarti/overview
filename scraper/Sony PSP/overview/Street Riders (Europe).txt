Street Riders is a reworked port of 187 Ride or Die, an urban street racing game. In a quest to gain money respect, you race while shooting opponents at the same time. The story revolves around the character Buck, who ends up in a gang war. There are 14 games modes with 66 missions in total. Some examples:  1. Whip Race: a regular race for the finish line. Your car cannot be destroyed completely. 2. DeathRace: each round, the last one is dropped and your car can be wrecked. 3. DeathMatch: fight three other cars in an arena. 4. Gang Fight: team deathmatch in an arena 5. Survivor: stay alive as long as possible. 6. Domination: similar to the survivor mode but with different levels in a parking lot. 7. MineField: all weapons have been replaced by mines, so it becomes important to take the lead early. 8. Time Ride: time trial 9. Chase: race while being tailed by the police. 10. Escort: guard a vehicle with precious cargo and ensure that it stays at a minimum speed and is not damaged by opponents.  There is multiplayer support for up to 8 players, with 45 missions and 7 modes. Next to the regular modes, you can also play cooperatively with a single car -- one driver and one gunner.
