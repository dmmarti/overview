Crazy Taxi: Fare Wars (known as: Crazy Taxi: Double Punch in Japan), is a PSP game, which is a port of both Crazy Taxi and Crazy Taxi 2. There is also a multiplayer aspect which was not available in the games' predecessors, where players compete against one another for customers and fare money. The game was developed by newly created Sniper Studios.
