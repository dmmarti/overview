In Eragon, based on the movie of the same name, which is in turn based on the book Eragon, by Christopher Paolini, the player controls Saphira, Eragon's dragon companion and friend, and her task is to help him along 9 different levels in which you will be killing enemies, protecting allies, racing through narrow corridors and clearing pathways. Saphira can attack, brake, reverse course and use boost to cross long distances. The main means of attack are her talons, used to grab enemies or larger objects to bomb everything on the ground below. There is also a selection of offensive and defensive spells. Health is replenished by eating livestock.  There are 6 arena levels unlocked by playing through the singleplayer campaign. These are multiplayer stages where you can fight versus as many as three bots or human players in 12 different game modes. The PSP version is completely different game than those for the other platforms, focusing only on Saphira the dragon while the others prominently feature the hero Eragon.
