Major League Baseball 2K6 is a version of its console counterparts, similar in style, but with different amenities. It still features the same rosters and the three year report as well that the console versions have, but has different animations, designed for the PSP, as well as the same game mechanics as the consoles as well.  It also features most of the same modes as the others, and for the first time for the PSP, a full franchise mode with all the options, are present for this game as well as a Home Run Derby career mode as well. It also has Jon Miller and Joe Morgan commentating as well and features Derek Jeter on the cover and can also be played against a friend using the Ad Hoc.
