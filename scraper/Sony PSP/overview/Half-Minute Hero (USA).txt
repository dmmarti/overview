Half-Minute Hero: The Second Coming is a direct sequel to Half-Minute Hero. It was originally developed for the Sony PSP as Yuusha 30 Second and released on August 4, 2011. It was localized by Marvelous USA and released on Steam for the PC platform on April 4, 2014.    Unlike Half-Minute Hero, the sequel's episodes all consist of RPG gameplay similar to the Hero 30 mode of the original. However, they have been expanded with additional features more similar to a typical RPG, such as an explorable world, leveling outside of battle, weapon combining, formations, special classes, a more developed plot line and a home base, the Hero Castle, that doubles as a giant mecha.
