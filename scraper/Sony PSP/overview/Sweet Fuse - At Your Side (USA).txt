Saki Inafune, niece to legendary game developer Keiji Inafune, can't wait to visit her uncle's new theme park. She's been invited to the opening day ceremonies, and is looking forward to a day of fun and excitement when suddenly Count Hogstein - a villain as corpulent and cliche as he is evil - blows up the Ferris wheel, takes the park management hostage, and declares the beginning of a deadly series of games. Desperate to save her uncle, Saki volunteers to be one of the participants in Hogstein's games, and finds herself thrust into the midst of excitement very different from what she'd expected when she woke up that morning. She'll need all of her cunning, determination, and exceptional insight to get herself and her fellow participants - all available bachelors - out alive and maybe, with a little luck, find love along the way.
