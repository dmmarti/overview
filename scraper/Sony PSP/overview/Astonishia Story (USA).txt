Astonishia Story is a Korean RPG, reminiscent of SNES and PSX JRPGs. It is a remake of the 1994 PC game Astonishia Story and a port of the re-release for the GP32 hand-held system.  The story involves a young knight named Lloyd on an epic journey to regain the sacred Wand of Kinan which was stolen from right under his battalion's care. The battle system used is a turn based tactical strategy RPG system, similar to Shining Force or Advance Wars.
