A PSP remake of Star Ocean, which was never released in the U.S., First Departure adds several new elements, including all new backgrounds and a tweaked battle system, while still preserving the exciting storyline and themes of the original.    It is Space Date 346, and in a sleepy town on the planet Roak, defense-force members Roddick, Millie, and Dorn are on yet another dull patrol when a mysterious plague begins turning people to stone. Fortunately, Ronyx and Ilia, members of a Terran Alliance reconnaissance mission, beam down to the surface just in time. They explain that the plague is actually a biological weapon, and they take the defense-force to the space vessel to discuss how to save Roak from this mysterious attack.
