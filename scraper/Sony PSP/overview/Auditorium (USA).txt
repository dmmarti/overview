Auditorium is a puzzle game where players need to build up a predefined orchestral soundtrack by filling audio containers on the screen. This is done by bending light particles with space modifiers to alter their path, directing them to the containers to transform light into sound. Split up in fifteen acts with about 70 levels in total, the spatial modifiers can be picked up and moved around the screen. There are many types with different effects: directional, attract, rabbit (speed up), repel (reverse) and deflect. In later acts there are also controls that act with a specific colour. The game spots three graphical modes. The browser version needs to be activated before it can be played in full.
