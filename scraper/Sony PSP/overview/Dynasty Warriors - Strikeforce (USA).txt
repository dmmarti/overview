For the first time in the franchise, up to four friends can join together to form a tactical "Strikeforce" with history's mightiest warriors. Working as a team, players can plan coordinated assaults to conquer massive armed fortresses and colossal beasts. The game's heart-pounding action will go where it has never gone before- the skies above. Gifted with new supernatural powers, characters can unleash new "Fury" transformations, streak across the skies and battle enemies in the air. Completely re-designed levels featuring immense castles, towers and ships serve as the backdrop for these legendary quests and battles with massive bosses. With both single-player and multi-player quests, new "air" fighting techniques, radical character customization, new challenges to conquer, and downloadable content, Dynasty Warriors: Strikeforce will forever change the way you experience the Dynasty Warriors universe.
