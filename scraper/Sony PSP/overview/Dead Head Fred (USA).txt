Dead Head Fred is an action game that tells a "classic tale of murder, corruption, revenge and... interchangeable heads". The main character is Fred Neuman. He's a private detective in the town of Hope Falls. During his investigations, he gets too involved with the dealings of the mob, so he's lured into a trap and beheaded. Shortly after his murder, he's found by Dr. Friedrich Steiner, who resurrects his body, and places his brain and eyes into a jar. From here begins the journey of Fred for revenge.  Due to the experiment, Fred has the ability to take the heads of enemies (a total of 9 are available), each giving him a special upgradeable power, like smashing ability, ability to fire projectiles or flight.
