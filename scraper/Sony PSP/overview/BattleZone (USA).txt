BattleZone for PSP is a fast-paced action game where players pilot agile hover tanks fighting other contestants in arena battles. Select one of six game types (DM, TDM, CTF and three others) in one of eight arenas (e.g. Russian Silo, New Mexico canyon, Arctic Tundra) for the right to wear the BattleZone championship crown.   Fight the way you want to fight choosing a light, medium, or heavy tank chassis and improving it with your favorite weapons and customizing it with your favorite tweak tune-ups. It's all about personality and choice while beating down AI in single-player, and your friends over WiFi multiplayer.   The single player campaign simulates a 20-match season on the semi-futuristic BattleZone circuit. Represent one of eight NATO countries and battle for pride against the others in their home arenas across the globe. Each country has a special weapon representing their style of play. Configure your tank by hot-swapping between fifteen weapons that are fully automatic, self-guided, or totally exotic.
