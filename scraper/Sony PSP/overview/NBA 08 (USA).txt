This version is different from the PS2 and PS3 versions. This one does not feature the Life Mode like the PS2, but has a "Conquest Mode" where the player can earn money through games, upgrading attributes and even team upgrades as well as buying items for their home city.    There is also the "Season Mode" where they can manipulate rosters and trade for better players. There is also "Block Party", a series of minigames like 3-Point Shootout, Playstation Skills Challenge and even Dodgeball. Players can also compete against each other using Ad-hoc and a "Pick Up Mode" where a player can randomly choose from 10 randomly selected players for a quick game against the CPU or human opponent.    It also features the voice talents of Kevin Calabro and Mark Jackson for an authentic television broadcast as well as new updated animations.
