NBA Live 09 is a simulation of the basketball sport. As usual the player controls the athletes himself and tries to perform typical basketball maneuvers. The player can choose between a full season, play-offs, the FIBA World Championship or the Dynasty mode were the player takes the role of the executive of a basketball team which means he has to grapple with managerial tasks like transfers or training.   Unique to the PSP version is that the game tracks all the player's accomplishments. With successes he improves his rank until he finally gets "The Crown". There are also three mini games: Handles, 2Ball and Two against Two.
