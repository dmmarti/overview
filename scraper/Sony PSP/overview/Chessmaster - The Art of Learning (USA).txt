Chessmaster: The Art of Learning expands the scope of chess to include broader principles of learning. Josh Waitzkin's much-anticipated book The Art of Learning is designed to pave the road to successful long-term growth on and off the chessboard.

Waitzkin then turns to the classics, introducing beginners to brilliant games from some of the most important players in the history of chess.
