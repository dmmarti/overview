EyePet is a pet simulation game with minigames and customization. Modeled after the original PS3 game it changes a few things for the portable format. The game requires a PSP camera and a "magic card" (included within the game package) to play. By pointing the PSP with the camera attached on the magic card the player makes the cute creature appear on screen. The player can play a variety of games with the pet, such as bowling, fishing or jumping on trampolines. The game encourages playing in different environments; by doing so the player has a chance of finding "treasures" - customization items. In a separate in-game area called Pet home the player may take care of the pet - feed it, wash it etc. and also change its appearance to their liking.
