echochrome is a puzzle game with a design inspired by the works of M.C. Escher. The gameplay is based around optical illusions, as the player must utilize five simple laws of perspective in order to join walkways, hide dangers and create path in order to reach the "echoes", checkpoints in the game. This implies that different actions are possible based on the camera perspective, which is changed when the player rotates the camera.  For the PSP there are two different versions. The UMD game offers 105 levels with three game modes for each: Solo mode (walk alone), Pair mode (control a white and black mannequin - when they meet each other they merge into a grey one and the puzzle is solved) and Others (solo mode with the additional of black enemies). The PlayStation store version is called echochrome Micro and only offers 56 levels with the three game modes.  All versions have a built-in editor. On the PS3 levels can be easily exchanged through the PlayStation Network. The system will also automatically download ten custom puzzles, rated highly by other users, to a maximum of 300. When the maximum amount has been reached, older ones are replaced.
