Smart Bomb is a puzzle game that has the player disarming a series of bombs. Not only does the player have to cut wires, there are also different premises like sliding a mirror around to bounce a laser beam from one side of the screen to the other, flipping tiles around to connect to the same colored terminals, as well as rolling steel balls around (similar to Marble Madness) to deactivate gravity fields and even moving a train around to collect the steel balls.  There are three different modes: The Story mode lets the player player in over 180 different types of puzzles in a set order.  The Arcade mode is the same type just the puzzles in random order and no cut-scenes while the Multiplayer mode has the ability to connect four players using the Ad Hoc to compete against each other.
