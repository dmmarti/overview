In Fired Up, you take on the role of various members of a resistance cell in an attempt to stop the forces invading your home country using various buggies tricked out with big guns and power ups.  It starts when a country, known only as The Republic, led by a leader known only as "The Iron Lady", invades your homeland.  From here, you take the roles of the resistance fighters Isabel, Viktoria, Erik and Tim in an effort to stop her plans.  Fired up also includes 8 player ad-hoc multiplayer for getting together with your friends in standard deathmatch games with the vehicles featured during the single player campaign.
