Koei's Dynasty Warriors series hits the handheld market in it's first fully 3D form on the PSP. As an officer in a Chinese army, you fight and kill thousands of soldiers in massive battles stretched over numerous battlefields - either in the campaign "Musou" modes or the single battle "Free" mode which can be used to train.  New to this PSP version is a bodyguard system where your selected second officer can give you certain items or abilities, for example one ensures you always have a horse when entering an area.and others can give you special powered up Musou attacks.
