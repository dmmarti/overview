Five great gates of Ouka be,    Name them here for all to see;  Sieryu, Byakko and Genbu  Kirin and Suzaku be there too;  At Heavenâ€™s gate twin keys you need;  At Earthâ€™s gates, bows the Divine Steed;  The soul is born as the Yang moon whirls  The body is born as the Yin moon twirls  The twin moons make a mighty hum  From the watery moon, it doth come.
