Space Invaders makes a return to the gaming scene with both old and new versions of the classic arcade experience. A classic mode includes the original color game and a port of the 1978 match-up mode. While playing the screen can be rotated 90 degrees to have two players compete on a single PSP. It also future a wireless mode with support of up to four players.  In the new Future Mode the game takes place in 13 stages from Pluto to Earth in full 3D. You have to shoot down the mothership, which spawns small invaders over time. This mode supports three viewpoints. In addition to the normal shots there is also Beat Attack accessed by triangle button. If you time your shots with the music using Beat Attack, they will become more powerful. You can also wipe out all aliens on the screen by holding down the triangle button until the fourth beat and then letting go.
