A compilation containing the arcade versions of the first four Gradius games as well as the previously PS1 exclusive game Gradius Gaiden. They are all exact conversions with some minor changes. While some versions had two-player co-op gameplay, all games in this compilation are single-player only. The triangle button is used for rapid fire, to combine shooting the regular weapon along with missiles.  The extras include videos from Gradius Deluxe Pack, Gradius III and IV and Gradius Gaiden. There is also a music gallery where the full soundtrack of the five included games is available. The games have also been adapted for different views (zoomed in and full) and the arcade ports include full options. A basic save and autosave system has also been implemented.
