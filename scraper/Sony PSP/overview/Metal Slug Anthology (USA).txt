Metal Slug 1-6 and X are included in the release, and the games have not been altered in any way. This is the same with the characters and abilities, which have all been kept the same.    The games themselves are done via emulation of the Neo Geo AES versions, except for Metal Slug 6, which is a port of the arcade version.
