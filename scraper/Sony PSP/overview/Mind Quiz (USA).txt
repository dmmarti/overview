Mind Quiz is brain training game very similar to the Brain Age: Train Your Brain in Minutes a Day! DS title, as both are based on the book; Train Your Brain: 60 Days to a Better Brain by Prof. Ryuta Kawashima.  Like the DS game, your calculations, reflexes, judgment and memory are tested, and there is an option to try and solve a daily series of problems, from which the age of the brain is then computed. It includes 49 exercises in 4 genres of calculation, reflex, judgment, and memory. Mind Quiz was supervised by Dr. Kawashima, the Japanese authority on Functional Brain Imaging.  It also has online gameplay to play against family and friends, and a mock exam, which evaluates comprehensive strength. By establishing new records, a Healing gallery is opened, with images of animals.
