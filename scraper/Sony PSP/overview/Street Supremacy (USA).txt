The main mode of the game is called "Team Rumble", where the player joins a clique, once doing must race in a series of events, winning these events will earn the player's team that "territory", taking control of that area.  Players can also recruit rival racers to their clique by draining their "Spirit Points", by smashing them into walls, guardrails and other cars, once depleted they will join the player's "clique".  Not only do players race against rival teams, but also against their own in "ranking battles", where a five car race will determine the rankings of the "clique".  The player can climb through the rankings by winning these races, eventually leading to the team leader and if he/she is beaten, they will become team leader of their group.
