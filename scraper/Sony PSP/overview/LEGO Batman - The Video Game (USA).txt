Lego Batman: The Videogame is an action-adventure video game developed by Traveller's Tales, published by Warner Bros., and released in 2008 for the Xbox 360, PlayStation 2, PlayStation 3, PlayStation Portable, Nintendo DS, Mac OS X and Wii video gaming platforms. It is the first Lego Batman video game. The game is based on the comic book character Batman and the Lego Batman toy line, who also handled marketing and financial aspects of the game.    The game is similar to the Lego Star Wars series and Lego Indiana Jones: The Original Adventures, in that it is both a game based on a licensed property, and has environments, objects, and creatures made out of Lego. However, Lego Batman is the first to have an original story. The Mac OS X version of the game was released in April 2009 by Feral Interactive.[2] A standalone sequel titled Lego Batman 2: DC Super Heroes was released on June 19, 2012, and a follow-up titled Lego Batman 3: Beyond Gotham was released on November 11, 2014.
