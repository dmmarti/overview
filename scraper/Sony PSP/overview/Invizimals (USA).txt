inviZimals turns your PSP system into a virtual creature hunter that lets you hunt and capture the monsters living in the world around you. Follow the clues as you track them around the world. After theyâ€™re captured, battle your inviZimals against your friends or train them to become stronger. Youâ€™ve never seen a game quite like this.    Hunt - Use the bundled Camera for the PSP system to hunt down invisible monsters as you race around the world to grab them before others do.  Capture - Use a wide range of techniques to capture them in your world: yell into the microphone to scare them, slap your hand down to trap them or shoot them from the sky.  Battle - Pit your inviZimals against the computer or enjoy multiplayer fights with friends.  Evolve - Learn new attacks and power up so you can level up your monster.
