FlatOut Head On boasts the most four-wheeled mayhem ever seen on PSP, with nine different game modes, including 36 carnage challenges, full career Championship, destruction derbies, multiplayer party mode and the bone-crunching Ragdoll stunt mode.    From rock-smashing dust ups in arid desert landscapes to down and dirty races through rubbish-strewn city streets, FlatOut's PSP debut is yet another gritty excursion into racing carnage.
