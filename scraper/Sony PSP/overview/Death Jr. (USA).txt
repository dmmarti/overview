Take on the role of the Grim Reapers teenage son Death Jr. after he unleashes an unspeakable horror from a box that Pandora herself couldn't open in a school field trip at the museum.  Death Jr. is a 3-D platform game in which you control Death Jr. a.k.a. DJ in an attempt to find his friends that have been taken by the evil necromancer Moloch. DJ's friend souls appear as puzzle pieces throughout the game in which you must find to bring them back.  Warp through 17 levels fighting demons and fiends using DJ's famed scythe along with other weapons like a shotgun, electric gun and even C4 Hamsters. Use DJ's scythe to not only maim and kill but to reach heights not accessible by jumping. Upgrade weapons and learn new moves (scythe combos) by collecting widgets scattered throughout the levels. The ability to destroy the environment is an advantage to DJ as the more successful hits with his scythe be it animate or inanimate his combo meter will rise allowing DJ's friend Pandora to assist in the fight.  Death Jr.'s camera is a free roaming camera that follows DJ around with the ability to snap to the position DJ is looking at the press of a button. You can also free look with the press of a button and lock on to enemies and strafe while shooting with a gun. At the end of each level you receive a report card that tells you your number of kills, how much destruction you caused, the total number of combo points, special items discovered and your final grade.
