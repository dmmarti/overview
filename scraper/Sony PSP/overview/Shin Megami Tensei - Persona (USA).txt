EXPERIENCE CHAPTER ONE OF THE FAMED PERSONA RPG SERIES: Completely rebalanced and remade, SMT: Persona allows younger fans of the series to find out what everyone's been talking about for years, and gives long-time SMT supporters a wholly different take on an all-time classic. The Key features are rebalanced, relocalized, and remade. Fully re-translated and featuring all new musical compositions from Shoji Meguro, famed composer of Persona 3 and 4, SMT: Persona is the perfect example of how a remake should be done. This definitive version includes content never before seen in North America. Reformatted to take advantage of the PSP hardware, this remake includes a new widescreen aspect ratio, redone music and sound, and all new animation, presenting the story better than ever before. Long known for its daring, often morally-charged stories, the SMT series has established itself as one of the premiere RPG series in terms of plot and characters, and SMT: Persona is no exception.
