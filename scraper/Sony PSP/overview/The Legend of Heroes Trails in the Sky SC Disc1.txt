The Legend of Heroes: Trails in the Sky SC is a role-playing video game developed by Nihon Falcom, the second of a trilogy of games in the Trails in the Sky series. Initially released in Japan in 2006 for Microsoft Windows and 2007 for the PlayStation Portable, the game did not see an English release on Windows until 2015, due to the large amount of text needed to be translated. Japanese-only high-definition versions were also released, including a HD port to the PlayStation 3 in 2013, and a HD remake for the Vita in 2015.
