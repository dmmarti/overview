A vicious circle of violence has erupted. The battle torn continent of Neverland is caught up in a great war between good and evil once again. Now, three young soldiers rise to put an end to this madness once and for all. In Spectral Souls, the player will switch between the three opposing kingdoms to play the Royal Demon Kingdom, the Imperial Army, or the Rebel Army. Depending on how you progress through the game with each of the forces, the story of the game will change.
