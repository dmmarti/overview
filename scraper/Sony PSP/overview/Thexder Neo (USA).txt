Thexder Neo is a enhanced remake of the original PC version of  Thexder, originally released in 1985.  Maintaining the original gameplay, the game is a side-scroller shooter in which the player controls a jet transformable robot armed with a homing laser.  The remake offers revamped 3d graphics, new and remixed music, an online mode which supports up to 6 players, and a new easier difficulty level.
