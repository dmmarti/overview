Hot Pixel is a casual game happening in a pixellized universe mixed from street culture, digital lifestyle and old-school style video games. It consists of 200 micro games, randomly selected from the pool in one mode, or grouped together into 10 episodes in a second mode, linked together by cut-scenes featuring the teenager DJON.  Each micro game lasts only a few seconds, similar to the WarioWare games. During this short time limit, the player has to work out what he is supposed to do aided by a short sentence that appears when the game starts. There are also a number of tutorials and training modes. After clearing a set number of micro games the player is presented with a longer "boss" micro game which is generally more challenging in order to clear the level. Some of the games have suggestive themes or crude content.  By going through the games, new ones are unlocked or presented with different modes, such as the removal of the time limit. Other features include a rating mode for the different characters, music jukebox, a list of unlocked video segments, and playlists to compile a list of favourite games or share it through the internet or memory sticks. The playlists come with 3 modes: Challenge (play through a selection), Survive (try to keep playing for a set amount of time) and Freeplay. There is an Ad Hoc multiplayer mode to compete against a friend for the best score. Playing well fills a gauge. When maxed out, it can be used to send a "disturber" that modifies the opponent's screen display.  Some of the micro games use concepts of popular games such as Battlezone and Breakout. Additional games can be downloaded from the developer's website and are imported via a memory stick.
