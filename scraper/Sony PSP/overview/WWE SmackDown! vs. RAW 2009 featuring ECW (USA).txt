The Smackdown vs Raw series continues with the 2009 edition. This game features vast improvements on the tag team action, including all new Hot-Tag, tag team finishers and new actions to help in the match.  As with the previous game the roster includes over 60 superstars from Smackdown, Raw and ECW. To keep the roster up-to-date, the game includes a roster editor allowing players to change the rosters superstars are on and change their alignment between face and heel. However, this is the first game in the Smackdown series since "Here Comes the Pain" not to feature any legends.  Another new feature is Create-a-Finisher, which allows players to create their own unique finishing move out of over 500 different animations. These can also be shared online during online matches.  This game includes two different story modes, i.e. Road to Wrestlemania and Career mode. Road to Wrestlemania mode allows you to play 6 unique stories involving Triple H, CM Punk, Chris Jericho, The Undertaker, John Cena and a co-op storyline featuring Batista and Rey Mysterio. Career mode is the replacement of GM Mode from previous games. This allows you to make a career for superstars and upgrade your created wrestlers.  Other features include the Highlight Reel, letting you create videos from your matches, the brand new Inferno Match, new positions in the backstage brawl and the new gauntlet match.
