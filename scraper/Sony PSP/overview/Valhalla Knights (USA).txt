The blood of demons has soaked the lands and freed the Dark Lord from his prison.  Regain your memories and unravel the mysteries of the great hero, Rastul who once sealed the Dark Lord away.  Create, Hire, or find NPCs along the way to join in your quest and adjust their combat style by allocating Thought Points.  Choose from multiple races (Humans, Elves, Halflings, and Dwarves,) and several classes including Fighter, Priest, Thief, Anchor, Samurai, and Ninja, each with their own visually distinct armor and weapons.    The game features rich 3D environments and real-time combat with up to 6 characters in your party and on-screen at once, with over 70 hours of gameplay including sub-quests.  Play with a friend for co-op specific missions, or battle against them in Vs. mode and wager items on the outcome!
