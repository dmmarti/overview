Dragoneer's Aria is an RPG game which follows its hero, Valen, a young man about to become a "Dragoon" in the city of Granadis, when suddenly an evil black dragon appears during his graduation ceremony. The dragon causes death and destruction but is repelled by a water dragon who suddenly appears. After the dust settles, Valen finds a girl named Euphe with whom he embarks on a quest to find out about the origin of the attacking black dragon.  The game features turn-based battles and a crafting system which enables the player to create accessories and weapons. The story is told through cutscenes rendered as ingame graphics and supported by both English and Japanese voice acting. In the Western release, the player can choose between either language for the voices before starting a new game while onscreen texts are in English.  Up to four player's can join forces via the PSP's Wireless mode. Each one controls a member of the party which can then loot dungeons.
