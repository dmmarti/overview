One of the first Sony MLB licensed games to be on the PSP, it features all the major league teams at the time as well as the top players for its day with brand new animations designed for the PSP. The game can be considered a slimmed down version of MLB 2006. It has the standard game modes, Quick Game, Season Mode as well as a Multiplayer mode where two players can compete against each other using the Ad Hoc.  Some of the new gameplay mechanics for the game areRelease Point Pitching with Confidence meter which would determine the success rate of the pitcher depending on the stats and skill of the player. The more successful pitches made within a certain zone, the easier the pitches become, missing them cause wild pitches or pitch a line drive right to the batter.  Another is the Playmaker Fielding Marker, where unlike other games this one used the players stats to determine if regular plays like pop-ups would be considered easy by giving the player ample opportunity by showing the landing location faster and giving it a more wider area.  Less skilled players would be given less of a warning and a smaller catching radius, making even the simplest plays more challenging.  The Branch Point Technology introduced a seamless flow of transition for the game that allowed the player to plan out the direction of a throw while still in the process of catching it and was also used for baserunning that gave it a smoother feel to running and sliding.
