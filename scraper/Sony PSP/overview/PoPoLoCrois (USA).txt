PoPoLoCrois is an isometric cel shaded retro-style RPG. This PSP version is the first entry in the series to be released outside of Japan. It is a remake of the first two PoPoLoCrois titles for the PlayStation seamlessly reworked into a single game with various enhancements. You play as the 10-year old Prince Pinon who needs to find way of saving his sleeping beauty mom, and the whole kingdom, from Ancient Evil.  While playing you are able to pick up different characters to form a party, each with a different personality and combat style. Battles occur randomly and they become semi-strategic turn-based if you turn off the default auto combat option. Combat doesn't take you to a different screen, it just defines a spot in the background moving it to a diagonal grid, where you will move and fight the enemy. In these fights, there are many battle options, from special skills to tag-team attacks. Actions are based on an action gauge that fills up. The game can be saved manually or automatically.
