Unbound Saga is a 3D scrolling fighting game. It's story is based on the upcoming comic book series of the same name.  The player tales the role of either Rick Ajax or Lori Machete, fighting through the wasteland known as Toxopolis. The primary aim is to reach the player's nemesis, The Maker. Each of the two characters has its own special abilities that are needed during the quest.  The overall gameplay consists of the player fighting his way through different levels, which are split into comic strips. There are some puzzles, as well, that must be solved in order to progress.   The story of the game is split into chapters, of which the most important feature final bosses. The in-game dialogues are triggered automatically and all of them are considered to be important to the main quest. Each chapter features an outro, except for the first one, which also features the intro of the game. Players will also be able to try out their skills in the Survival Mode which is available from the start and does not need unlocking.  The game is only available through the PlayStation Network by digital download.
