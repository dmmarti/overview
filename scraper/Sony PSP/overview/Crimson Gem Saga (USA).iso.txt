Then when he finally gets a lead on a job, it ends up getting him robbed and nearly killed...and that's just the beginning. Soon killian and his new "acquaintances" will end up getting caught up in much larger events that revolve around an ancient artifact called the wicked stone.crimson gem saga is a turn-based rpg, with over world travel being done on an isometric plane. The game has some minor action elements sprinkled into the turn-based gameplay, like critical combo chains and an ambush system. Characters level up individually, but all draw from a group pool of skill points in order to unlock and gain new skill abilities, some of which are combination attacks. In essence, the core gameplay is very similar to a jrpg, despite the fact that the game's developed by a korean company.
