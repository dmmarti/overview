The PSP version of Activision Anthology is a compilation of 44 classic Atari 2600 titles. On top of that, it includes an eighties soundtrack with 10 licensed songs to pull you back into that era.  Unlike the GBA version, it contains the Imagic titles from the console and PC/Mac releases (Atlantis, Demon Attack, and Moonsweeper), along with more music, but not the homebrew titles as offered in the GBA and PC/Mac release.  In the media section, you can view the original cartridge in 3D, as well as the manual. Games can be played in the original aspect ratios (windowed in the middle of the screen), or stretched for a full-screen view. The game supports game sharing so two players can play with a single copy through an Ad Hoc network. There are different difficulty levels and you can save the game state to continue playing later. High scores are recorded and you can unlock achievements such as original gamer patches and vintage TV commercials.  The following games are included:  1. Atlantis 2. Barnstorming 3. Beamrider 4. Boxing 5. Bridge 6. Checkers 7. Chopper Command 8. Cosmic Commuter 9. Crackpots 10. Decathlon (The Activision Decathlon) 11. Demon Attack 12. Dolphin 13. Dragster 14. Enduro 15. Fishing Derby 16.
