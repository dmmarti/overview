The original Lemmings has been remade for the PSP, with new graphics. In this puzzle game, you guide a group of lemmings through increasingly complex levels. The creatures cannot be controlled directly, but you can assign skills to them, such as diving, bashing, building... to make them reach the end of the level unharmed.  In addition to original scenarios, the PSP version has 36 new levels. It also includes a map builder that allows you to create new maps and share them through WiFi.
