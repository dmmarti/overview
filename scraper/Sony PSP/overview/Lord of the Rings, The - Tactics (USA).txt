The Lord of the Rings: Tactics is a completely original strategy game set in Tolkien's Middle-Earth. Players experience the entire trilogy, from the earliest battle at Weathertop to the final conclusion at Minas Tirith and Mordor.    Unlike other tactics games, which are strictly straightforward turn-based affairs, The Lord of the Rings: Tactics innovates in its system. Players assign their moves simultaneously with the AI, and then all the actions unfold. In this way, players must guess their opponent's intentions and try to block them before they actually happen. This keeps the action moving much faster than a traditional tactics game.
