This version of Juiced is built specifically for PSP, with unique multiplayer games and and an expansion on the crew and pink-slip racing features. The game was built from the ground up on PSP, with new cars, tracks, characters and game modes. The built-in wireless connectivity on the PSP lends itself to expanding the multi-player options, including multiplayer crew races, pink slip racing and the all new â€˜Eliminatorâ€™ mode where the slowest driver per lap is removed from the competition, and the winner is the last one left in the race.
