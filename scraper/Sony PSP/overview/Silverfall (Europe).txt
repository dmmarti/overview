The PSP release of Silverfall is a port of the initial PC release from 2007, with various adaptations to make it more suitable for the platform.  The player chooses one of 4 races (human, elf, troll, goblin) before starting his journey. The game remains - as in the initial version - a hack-and-slash RPG with a top-down view, with quests and dialogue with NPCs. The player's quest of saving the realm of NelwÃ« from the spreading evil also involves taking sides with either the adepts of technology, or those of nature.  The first visible difference from the PC release is the visual style. The cel shading has been abandoned while the textures and polygonal models have been downgraded. The game now has a more colourful palette.  A difference concerning the game mechanic is the absence of companions. The development team's reasoning for this is the console's less resources available. As a compensation though, the number of enemies on screen has been increased.  The last notable difference with the PC release is that the open world environment has turned into a succession of levels. The reason for this is to adapt the game to the portable style of the console, as the developers had in mind play sessions of ten minutes, although this doesn't affect the c:a 20 hours duration of the campaign.
