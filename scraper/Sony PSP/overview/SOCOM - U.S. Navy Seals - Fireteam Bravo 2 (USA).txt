The Navy SEALs are invading the PSP for a second covert campaign, one that will take handheld owners through 14 non-linear missions with dynamically changing objectives. Commanders guide a two-man team across multiple terrain types as they strive to build "command equity" and "local influence" through successful stealth and tactical operations. By rescuing civilians, completing goals, and uncovering bonus objectives, players will earn points to spend on weapons or military support in the form of supply drops and air strikes. Black market equipment and intelligence can also be acquired from the local populace, improving the SEAL team's chances for success.    An entry in the SOCOM series wouldn't be complete without multiplayer options, and Fireteam Bravo 2 includes wireless support for up to 16 players in both Ad-hoc and Infrastructure modes. Three new game types are introduced in this sequel, including a capture-the-flag variant, and users are now able to create custom tournaments, ladders, and even clan challenges. Fireteam Bravo 2 also offers an improved friends list and instant messaging to help simplify the process of finding worthy teammates and opponents. As in the first PSP title, Fireteam Bravo 2 lets owners of the PS2 version link the two games to unlock special features in both SOCOM titles.
