Every Extend Extra is a remake of the popular freeware game Every Extend and in all main aspects of gameplay it sticks to its independent roots. The main difference between E3 and the original game is E3's music adaptation, just like the other Tetsuya Mizuguchi's synesthesia titles (Lumines and Rez). E3's main arcade mode allows the player to advance through different stages, each of them featuring different background, enemy designs, music, bosses and a varying pace of play.  As in the original game you too are unable to shoot. The only way of defense is to detonate your "ship" in the vicinity of the enemy. Enemies appear in randomized patterns, and the main goal is to detonate at the right moment and position, to set up a chain reaction of explosions and earning a combo bonus. Blowing oneself up takes away from your overall stock of lives, with a new life being issued at specific amounts of points.  The original game has been included with the PSP version as well.
