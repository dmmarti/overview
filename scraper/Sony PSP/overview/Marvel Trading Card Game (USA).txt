Marvel Trading Card Game is a strict electronic conversion of the Vs. System collectible card game rules by Upper Deck. It includes cards from all of the Marvel-based Vs. sets through the X-Men set.  The gameplay involves head-to-head battles where players recruit superhero characters with various strengths and powers onto the playfield. Each character has a basic Attack and Defense value which determines the outcome of individual character battles. This basic mechanic is augmented by character powers, Equipment cards (which give the character additional powers/stats), Location cards (which affect multiple cards or game rules while they are face up), and Plot Twist cards (which are often played to change the outcome of individual character battles by boosting Attack or Defense values).  The game features two single player campaigns, tutorials, puzzles, and an online mode similar to Magic The Gathering Online. The online mode supports cross-platform play between the PC and PSP versions.
