Super Stardust Portable is an asteroid arcade shooter viewed from above and is based on the PS3 version of Super Stardust HD. In this classic shooter, the player's mission is to destroy everything that comes against him on the screen. Enemies are mainly asteroids but also other spaceships and mines. Because the game has been reworked for PSP, there is no planet in the background and the wireless multiplayer mode is not available. Controls on the left side moves the ship and right sides four buttons controls firing. Super Stardust Portable also introduces a new game mode called Impact, where the player can only use bombs and boost. Also, the game's end boss has been changed to be more difficult.
