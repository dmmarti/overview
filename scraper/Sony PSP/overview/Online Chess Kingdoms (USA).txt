Online Chess Kingdoms allows players to go for a game of classic chess on the PSP, or to go online and battle against other players. There is a Battle mode that enables players to move chess pieces simultaneously, like speed chess but faster. There are five distinct armies to choose from with two unique chessboards from each armies' realm and a bonus chessboard at the end. The online mode allows competition with other players from around the world in a persistent environment. There is also an online player ranking system.
