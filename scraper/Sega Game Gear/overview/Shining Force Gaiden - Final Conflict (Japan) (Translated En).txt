One of the three gaiden (side-story) Shining Force games for GameGear. The events of the game take place in a time period between the first and the second mainstream Shining Force games. After Max, the leader of the first Shining Force, defeated the Dark Dragon, peace was restored to the world. However, the sorceress Mishaela took control over the forces of evil. Pursuing her, Max' comrades got injured and were forced to quit. Upon returning back to their hometown, they found out Mishaela has already taken the Elder hostage. Lead by the young warrior Ian, the Force has to find Max and to defeat Mishaela.  The game is a strategy RPG with gameplay similar to other Shining Force games. You control a large party of warriors (you can choose the characters yourself from many available). The game consists mainly of large strategic turn-based battles, in which you navigate your characters around and attack the enemies physically, or cast area-based spells.
