Donald no Magical World is a Sega Game Gear platform game. It features Ronald McDonald, mascot of the McDonald's fast-food chain. The game was only released in Japan, though curiously if the player inserts the cart into a western Game Gear, it will be translated into English, revealing a unused title in the process - Ronald in the Magical World.
