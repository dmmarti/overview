Scratch Golf is an overhead golfing sim that the player can play on two different golf courses either against three computer opponents in a game of scratch golf or practice on any course by themselves.  Two-players can also play via link up against each other in head-to-head or team up and go up against a computer duo.  Like many other golf games the player uses a power and accuracy bar that is brought up after pressing a certain button and pressing it again to confirm the position.
