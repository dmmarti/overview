In "Sylvan Tale", you play a young warrior who strolls in the forest and suddenly notices a mysterious glowing object. He touches the object, and gets teleported to the land of Verda. A mysterious voice talk to him, saying that he has to visit six fortresses scattered across the land, and to retrieve six magic droplets, which is the only way to save the inhabitants of Verda from perishing.  This is an action adventure with RPG elements. You wander around the world, visiting towns and descending into dungeons, fighting enemies in real-time combat and getting various items (for healing, HP-increasing, etc.). As the game progresses, you will also collect items that can be used to transform into various creatures with different abilities. As a mole you can dig and destroy certain stones, as a merman you can swim, as a turtle you can use your shell as protection, as a mouse you can go through mouse holes and manipulate certain magnetic stones, and as a bird you can fly and dodge attacks.
