Jeopardy! is a conversion of the long-running TV quiz show where the answers are given and contestants must provide the questions. Compared to the Genesis version released a year earlier, the Game Gear version features only about half the number of questions, and replaces the console version's photo-realistic style with a more cartoon-like approach. Unlike in the actual TV show, there always only two contestants. Players can choose their avatar from six different characters. The game supports one or two players: in a two-player game, both share the same Game Gear and must buzz in by using either the d-pad or the face buttons. Once buzzed in, the question must be spelled out within 60 seconds, with the game allowing for some spelling variations and minor misspellings. Game rules are accurate to the original show and include Daily Doubles and the Double Jeopardy and Final Jeopardy rounds. The game features a cartoon representation and digitized speech samples of TV host Alex Trebek (plus a digitized picture on boot-up) and a rendition of the original theme music.
