The Game Gear received a unique adaptation of the 1997 dinosaur sequel The Lost World: Jurassic Park. It is primarily a side-scrolling platform game but also includes some other gameplay elements. Players control a hunter who, armed with a stun rifle and having enlisted the the help of a friendly Procompsognathus ("Compy"), must make his way through various levels on Isla Sorna to finally reach a helicopter and escape. The next level to be played can be chosen on an overview map of the island, allowing for some freedom regarding level order. In the standard platform levels, the goal is simply to reach the exit. Various dinosaurs must be avoided or taken out with the gun and environmental dangers like sand pits, rock avalanches and water holes must also be mastered. The gun's ammunition is unlimited and the hunter can take several hits before losing a life - his health is indicated by the color of his shirt. Replacement body armor is available as a power-up. In one of the levels, players don't control the hunter but Compy instead. Compy can only take one hit before losing a life, and instead of a gun, he has a jump attack. He also has the ability to climb walls. After most platform levels, a boss fight against an especially large and/or dangerous dinosaur follows, each attacking in a certain pattern requiring its own strategy to defeat. Variety from the standard platforming comes in a level where a raging Triceratops attacks from the left and the hunter must run for his life through the automatically-scrolling landscape. The final escape from the island takes place in a car, seen from the front (i.e. driving towards the screen), with a T. Rex attacking from behind. Both the dinosaur's attacks as well as obstacles on the road (like boulders and water puddles) must be avoided to reach the goal.
