Beavis and Butt-Head want to go to a GWAR concert, but they do not have the money for the tickets. Thus the infamous duo sets out to search the whole town for enough cash.  The game is basically a jump'n'run game and cannot be called platformer, since the are no platform. All stages consist solely of one linear floor. The main goal of each stage is just to get from left to right. However, at one point in the game, you reach a ticket counter, and you cannot proceed if you do not have enough money to buy the concert tickets. So apart from reaching the exit, each stage must be searched for money, which both lies around and is contained in lockers, dustbins, coin-operated telephones and other things. Sometimes, even primitive puzzles must solved, e.g. by picking up books and selling them in the book shop.  The stages are filled with all kinds of life decreasing obstacles, mostly bombs, moving objects or vermin. Beavis and Butt-Head have no means of attacking or defending, so everything must be evaded. The player controls only Butt-Head, Beavis is just following and will do any action delayed. However, if any one of the two is hit, you loose energy (which can be restored by picking up food). Possible actions are running, jumping, ducking, picking up items and interacting with the object in the background (if possible).
