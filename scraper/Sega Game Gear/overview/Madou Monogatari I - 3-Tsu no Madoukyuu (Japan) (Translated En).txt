In this game, you play a young apprentice sorceress named Arle. She studies at a magic school, and is about to take her most important examination: go to the Tower of Satan, defeat the enemies and overcome all the obstacles on the way using her magic power!  Mado Monogatari I is a puzzle/RPG mixture. Featuring characters and puzzles from Puyo Puyo games, it is set in a 3D dungeon which you explore from first-person perspective. Combat takes place on a platform, and is a mixture of turn-based and real time styles. Enemies attack you even if you wait, but you have time to perform your moves. You should hold down buttons and press direction arrows to execute various magic spells.
