Tecmo World Cup Soccer is a simple soccer game with an overhead view. Only one mode (World Cup) is available, playable by either one player against the computer AI or two players against each other. Any of the sixteen available national teams can be selected by the player; the opponent cannot be chosen manually if controlled by the AI. The game itself allows only basic moves such as passing, shooting, and side-sliding during defense. There is no team management or strategy available, and no options for game rules and conditions.
