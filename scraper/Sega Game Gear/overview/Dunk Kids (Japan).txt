DUNK KIDS for the Sega Game Gear from 1994! Two on two basketball with 2 players per side that works on one or two Sega Game Gears! Dunk Kids is a Japanese GameGear basketball video game endorsed by the All Japan Street Basketball Association, of the ASBA! (shouldn't it be the AJSBA??) Teams included are Japanese cities like Tokyo and countries like Russia, China, The United States of America and EUROPE!!! (the continent, not the band. It's not really a country either. It's a group of countries unified by "The Final Countdown") Dunk Kids is fun arcade style basketball videogame action, good times but nothing groundbreaking. The title is pretty funny.
