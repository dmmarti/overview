Popeye Beach Volleyball is a volleyball game starring characters from the Popeye cartoon series, released exclusively for the Sega Game Gear in 1994. The player controls Popeye, and can pair up with various members of the Popeye cast. Though Popeye is an American invention, curiously this game never left Japan, presumably due to Technos Japan's poor financial situation at the time.
