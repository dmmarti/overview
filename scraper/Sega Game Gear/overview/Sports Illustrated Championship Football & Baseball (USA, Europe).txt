The Game Gear received its own version of the two-in-one sports game licensed by the sports magazine, also available on other platforms. The football module offers Exhibition and Season games (seasons can be saved via passwords), choice of difficulty (high school/college/pro) and selectable quarter length (5, 10 or 15 minutes). While there is no NFL license, the included teams are based on the 1995 season and include the two expansion teams Carolina and Jacksonville for a total of 30 teams. Gameplay is seen from a horizontally-scrolling view from above the field. The playbook allows choosing from over 90 plays. The baseball module also includes Exhibition and Season games with a password function. It allows the setting of game length from one to nine innings and the toggling of automatic running. 28 MLB-based teams are available (but without an official license). Gameplay follows the standard model of the time: pitching and batting are seen from a view behind the batter. When a ball is hit, the view zooms out to show the entire field for running and catching.
