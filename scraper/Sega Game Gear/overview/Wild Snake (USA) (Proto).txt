WildSnake is a puzzle game in which the player must manage falling snakes in a confined space and keep the snakes from reaching the top of the space. Snakes fall and slither until they reach a resting spot on the floor of the space. A snake will destroy any other snakes of the same color and pattern that it touches with its head on the way down, which often has the chain effect of loosening the pile of snakes so that all the snakes slither into new positions, possibly eliminating even more snakes.
