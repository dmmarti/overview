The Game Gear version of PGA Tour 96 is the last entry in the series on the platform. It has a different selection of courses, licensed PGA golfers and modes compared to other versions. The three available courses are Sawgrass, Summerlin and River High. The five game modes are Practice, Putting, Driving, Skins and Tournament. Up to four players taking turns on the same Game Gear are supported. The gameplay is similar to many other games of the genre: the player is shown an overhead view of the map and then taken to a perspective directly behind the golfer. Using the D-pad to move a cursor on screen to aim their shot and pressing a main button to activate the power/accuracy meter below, pressing once to set the power and again for accuracy.
