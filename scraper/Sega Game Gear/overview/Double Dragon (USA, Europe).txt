The Double Dragon brawler series received a unique entry on the Game Gear. In this game, only one of the two Lee brothers takes on the underworld: Jimmy has been murdered by the Dragon Lord gang, so it's Billy's turn to exact revenge.  Billy's rampage will take him through six large levels, each consisting of several sub-stages. These include skid row at night, uptown during the day, the harbor, a subway train, the countryside and a mansion. Numerous Dragon Lord goons stand in Billy's way and must be taken out with punches and kicks. Each of the six large levels concludes with a boss fight against an extra large enemy. In a departure for the series, Billy is able to pick up guns (with a limited amount of shots) at various points during the game, allowing him to dispatch foes easily from a distance. By collecting various power-ups, Billy can increase his health bar and the number of continues. A statistic after every level details amount of hits taken and dealt.
