Hurricanes is based on the 90's cartoon show. You play as Cal and must play through 12 levels. The objective of each level is to collect a certain amount of items to open the exit to the next level. These items include medallions and different colored trophies. The game will take you through many locations including a lagoon, a haunted house, an airport, a western town, an ancient temple, and you will eventually make it to the gym for the final fight against the gorgons. You will take on many enemies throughout the levels including grunts, invisible cowboys, spiders, and members of the Gorgons.
