Solitaire Poker. That's certainly an odd sounding combinasion, but that's exactly what it is. It's even more interesting that you realize that there is a touch of bingo in there too. Your objective is to draw face-down cards from one of four different piles and draw these cards into five different "hands" that are scored as traditional poker values. Hower the the hands may be scored in any combinasion... vertical, horizonal or diagonal on the game board... (where the bingo element comes into play).
