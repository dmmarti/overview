Wizard Pinball is a pinball game that offers one table with a fantasy theme, featuring wizards, dragons, ghosts and skeletons. Two players can play taking turns, each starting with five balls. The table features various secrets and bonuses, including several hidden extra levels and a multi-ball feature. A high score list is available, but there is no way to save it upon turning off.
