Sonic Blast was released for Game Gear in conjunction with Sonic 3D Blast (aka Sonic 3D: Flickies' Island) for Genesis/MD and Saturn.  It boasted similarly rendered character sprites and colorful backgrounds.  The game was yet another addition to the series, plus Sega had hoped it would be a boost to the dying Game Gear's title selection at the time.  Brazilian based TecToy re-released the game for Sega Master System in 1997, a year after the initial release (while many may think this is a pirated title, TecToy is indeed licensed to produce and release games under the Sega name).
