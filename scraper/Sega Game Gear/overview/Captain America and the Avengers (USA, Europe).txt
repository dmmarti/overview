A conversion of the arcade game of the same name, Captain America and The Avengers is a one or two player (simultaneous) side-scrolling beat 'em up in which four Marvel Comics licensed heroes (Captain America, Iron Man, Hawkeye and Vision) take on the evil Red Skull (who "by assembling a team of super-villains seeks to conquer the world"). Isn't that always the way?
