This is an official NFL-licensed football game for the Game Gear. It has several features that were pretty new for that time: An announcer comments on the events on the field, the viewpoint changes as you play the game, multiplayer action, and the roster includes 1500 players that were taken from the up-to-date 1994 NFL team roster with all 28 teams. You're not only in control of the quarterback - you can also be the receiver.
