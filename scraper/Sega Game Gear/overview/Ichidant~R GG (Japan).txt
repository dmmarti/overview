Ichidant-R is the second game in the Puzzle and Action series, and the sequel to Tant-R. Twenty new minigames are present, including rocketship assembly, a batting contest, and hitting the brakes on a speeding car.  The game once again includes an arcade mode for one or two players. This time, the player is questing to rescue a kidnapped princess from an evil knight. There is also a quest mode which plays like a simple RPG, where battles are fought via minigames. Of course, the four-player competition and free modes also make a return, rounding out the package.
