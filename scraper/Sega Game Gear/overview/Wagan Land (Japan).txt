In Wagan Land, you control a green mechanical dinosaur named Wagan who has the ability to temporarily stun enemies with sound waves. The waves are shaped like the noises "Wah" and "Gah"  The mad scientist Dr. Devil is trying to take over Wagan Land, and Wagan wants to protect his home. There are power-ups called Waganizers, which make Wagan's sound waves more powerful, stunning the enemies for a longer amount of time. If four Waganizers are collected, Wagan becomes temporarily invincible, faster and actually able to defeat enemies. At the end of certain stages is a boss. Each boss challenges Wagan to a mini-game instead of a battle.
