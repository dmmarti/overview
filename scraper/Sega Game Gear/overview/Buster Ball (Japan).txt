Buster Ball is a futuristic, top-down action game. It is reminiscent of soccer, only with robot players and less restrictions for brutality. The basic principle is unchanged: both teams consist of athletes which want to put the playing ball into the other team's goal. However, the six playing areas have several built-in obstacles like bumpers (hurls the ball and athletes away) or electric barriers which restrict mobility. The player may participate in a league system.
