The handheld version of the console versions is along the same lines.  It does feature sports-related questions as the main bulk of the game where the player answers questions in three rounds using the D-Pad to spell out answers.  However, it does not feature digitized contestants, studio or the host Alex Trebek, though it does feature a photo likeness of him for intros.  Instead it features a more cartoonish look without sports-themed contestants and less questions than the console versions.  It does feature a two-player option utilizing the link cable allowing friends to compete head-to-head, but only allows the player to compete against one computer opponent as opposed to two as in other versions.
