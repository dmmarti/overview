Another entry in the Poker Face Paul series this one focuses on the game of Gin. The player can choose from three different players with each being a level of difficulty: Jack is the easiest and has the player learn the basics, Jane is a medium setting and a little harder while Ming is the hardest setting. Players can also customize a variety of options including rule settings and can learn the basics of Gin through a built in strategy that teaches the player.
