 Seventeen years after the initial release of the classic LucasArts adventure Maniac Mansion, the game has been revamped for modern systems in a 256-colour freeware remake by fans. Aside from the crisp graphics, they improved the SCUMM-interface itself and it now features digital sound effects and continuous background music, designed with the Adventure Game Studio engine. Although it is a complete remake built from scratch, the designers kept the gameplay, story and the many gags from the original game intact.
