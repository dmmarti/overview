 Almost twenty years passed since the inhabitants of Earth defeated the Leather Goddesses of Phobos. The year now is 1958, and the scientific world is excited at the news of the discovery of a new planet in the Solar System, a so-called "Planet X". One night, a spaceship crash-lands in the small town of Atom City, Nevada, home to a military base and a nuclear power plant. The alien Barth, a self-described "Pulsating Inconvenience" from Planet X, brings terrible news to the people of Earth: the Goddesses have conquered Planet X and forced its denizens to become sex slaves. Gas Pump Girls is the sequel to Leather Goddesses of Phobos. The player can choose between three different protagonists: the alien Barth, the gas station owner Zeke, or Lydia, the daughter of the astronomer who discovered Planet X. Barth's scenario involves different tasks, while the humans' gameplay is largely identical, with the exception of different dialogues. Unlike the previous game, the sequel is a graphical adventure without any text input. The player interacts with the environment in a point-and-click fashion, with a "smart cursor" that automatically changes its shape depending on the possible action that can be executed with a person or an object. The game has multiple-choice conversations, many of which are optional.
