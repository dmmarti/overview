 The original American football entry in the Backyard Sports series, Backyard Football lays the groundwork for kid-friendly football simulation. Not only can kids create players of their own, but they can add child versions of certain NFL stars to their teams using the "Create-A-Player" feature.  Kids play a simplified, 5-on-5 reduction of the sport, with no penalties and power-ups for good plays. Speed is of the essence, as quarters are over in a minute. Features season, Hall of Fame, and exhibition modes.  Backyard Football is the first game in the Backyard Sports series to be licensed by its respective national league.
