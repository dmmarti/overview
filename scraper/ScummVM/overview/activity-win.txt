 Putt-Putt and Fatty Bear's Activity Pack contains 15 different games and activities for kids 3-8. This is a compilation of Putt-Putt's Fun Pack and Fatty Bear's Fun Pack, along with four new games. Most of the games are played against either Putt-Putt or Fatty Bear. Some games are traditional, such as Tic-Tac-Toe, Checkers, Reversi, or the card game Go Fish.  Others are renamed versions of popular games. "Remember!" is basically Concentration, a memory game. "The Cheese King" is Hangman, while the "On-Ramps and Off Ramps" is the board game chutes and ladders. "Word Hunt!" is the device in puzzle books where you find words in letter grids. In "Guess It!", you use logic to figure out which fruits are used and which locations they've been placed in. "Lines and Boxes" is another logic game, making boxes by drawing lines between a grid of dots.Finally, Tangrams is a spatial recognition game, fitting pieces into different shapes. Most of these games have multiple difficulty levels. Although designed for children 3-8, many of the games should give even parents the occasional run-for-the-money at the Hardest level.  Finally, there are four games just for fun: In "Circus Stormin'" - a side-scrolling arcade game - you control Putt-Putt up and down, moving him around obstacles and having him pick up balloons. There's also a sliding tiles (logic puzzle) game with slightly varying images, and a Pachinko pinball where you can create your own 'field' of 6x11 bumpers and the balls make amusing sounds when they hit. There's also a 35-page in-game coloring coloring book with 16 mixable palette slots.
