 The Backyard Sports series let you play games with a group of virtual kids, some of whom happen to be young versions of professional athletes. Backyard Baseball 2003 brings the stars of Major League Baseball to your home park.  Players create a junior avatar of themselves and draft a team from 30 other backyard kids and kid versions of 30 MLB superstars then deck themselves out in their favorite uniforms and head for the diamond. Standard sports simulation game types are available including exhibition games and season play but the emphasis is on fun and accessibility for all ages.
