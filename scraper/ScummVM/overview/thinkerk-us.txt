 This is an edutainment game where the player joins the Brightly twins Ben and Becky to learn about various kindergarten subjects. Through the usage of their shape-shifting abilities, they lead the player through a variety of activities including Letters in the Sky, Bird Perch Math, and Mealtime Mazes. Doing each activity to completion or for a certain amount of time awards SmartStars, with some games awarding more than others and more being awarded if the activity is played at a higher difficulty. When the player has enough, they can attempt the SuperStar of Smarts challenge, where the SmartStars are used as a way to power the activity. If the player can complete the challenge before all the SmartStars are used up, they are awarded a SuperStar of Smarts and a certificate, and can continue to try for more to go up in rank.
