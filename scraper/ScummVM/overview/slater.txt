 Slater the Petrosaur, protagonist of Sierra's Oil's Well remake, has got himself a buddy in the form of Charlie, another dinosaur of indeterminate species. Together, they visit various locations and undertake various tasks toward the end of enjoying a camping trip in the great outdoors together.  The game is presented as a series of static images, described in text at the bottom of the screen -- then optionally narrated for children whose reading skills aren't yet up to keeping up with the plot. After each description has been read, the illustrations can be interacted with like a pop-up book, numerous hidden hot spots on every page yielding zany + whimsical animations.
