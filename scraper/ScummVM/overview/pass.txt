Passport to Adventure is a pack of demos of various games by Lucasfilm Games that use the SCUMM scripting language. It contains playable EGA demos of Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade, The Secret of Monkey Island, and Loom. Each game ends by showing a list of people who led the original games, as well as the people involved in creating the demo. At that point, the demo can be restarted by pressing ESC, allowing the user to select another game demo to try.
