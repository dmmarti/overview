Spielburg Valley was once a prosperous and peaceful place: forests were kept safe by the Baron's guards and merchants sold their wares in the thriving town. Only the vile Ogress, Baba Yaga, threw a dark shadow over the valley. When Baron Stefan von Spielburg ordered Baba Yaga to leave, she cursed the graveyard, such that the dead could not rest at night. When the Baron then sent the guards after her, she cursed him: 'Upon Von Spielburg and all his clan, this Curse I now demand: What I will shall come full measure, so shall ye lose all that ye treasure'! In the following years, the baron's young daughter Elsa was kidnapped from the castle by large winged creature and his son Barnard never returned from a hunt in the forest. As the Baron continued to send his guards out to defeat the ogress, his army grew smaller and smaller with their skulls decorating the spiked fence around Baba Yaga's house. With the Baron's inability to continue protecting the valley, the Brigands saw an opportunity and, with their new leader, started terrorizing all people who would attempt traveling to the town. All kinds of Monsters also returned in large numbers to the valley. The Baron's only hope now is the prophecy: 'Come a hero from the East, Free the man from in the beast, Bring the child from out the band, Drive the Curser from the land.'
