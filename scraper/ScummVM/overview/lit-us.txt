 In 1992, a woman named Doralice was investigating a shipwreck when suddenly it started moving. Unable to understand what's going on, Doralice investigates the ship and eventually finds out that she was chosen by the Space Time Patrol to travel back in time, to the year 1840. It appears that a man from the 22th century named Jarlath Equs has obtained a sample of a highly powerful and enigmatic element known as Americium 1492, and traveled back in time in order to hide it together with other treasure on the island of St. Cristobald. Doralice mission is to stop Jarlath at all costs - even if that means endangering her own future existence, for she herself is the descendant of Jarlath's wife and her lover...  Lost in Time is a puzzle-solving adventure game. Most of the gameplay is dedicated to exploring the surroundings and combining inventory items or using them with other objects to solve puzzles. The navigation and the manipulation of objects is performed from a first-person perspective. The game uses short video clips (sometimes with live actors) as graphical "comments" to the player's actions or as cutscenes.
