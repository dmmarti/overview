 A sequel to Simon the Sorcerer, this second game in the series gives us more mis-adventures from our teenaged sorcerer (of some sort). Thrown into another dimension by his own wardrobe, Simon starts the heroic mission (of some sort) to find -- another wardrobe that could get him back home. Equipped with his pointy sorcerer's hat (of some sort), he will also rescue the world (again) from the evil Sordid.  A point-and-click adventure in a style similar to the first Simon game, only technologically improved.
