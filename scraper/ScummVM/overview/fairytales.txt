 Bookend has been mixing up Bookwyrm's fairy tales and you have to set things right by aiding well known fairy tale characters such as Cinderella and Snow White.  To set things right, you will need to go around acquiring objects, such as Jack's magical beans, to give to Jack so that he can raise a beanstock.  The game is designed with younger gamers in mind, and features a simple VGA interface with two actions, "Do" and "See"; rather than the full hidden icon bar used in other Sierra games.
