 Simon the Sorcerer's Puzzle Pack is a collection of small puzzle games that go around the Simon the Sorcerer's theme. There are three games:  Swampy Adventures - help Swampy through 50 levels of puzzles as he attempts to rescue his children from the evil Sordid.  NoPatience - Four solitaire patience card games featuring a unique Simon the Sorcerer themed deck.  Jumble - A new type of sliding tile puzzle - rearrange the pieces in a constantly changing animation! There's also a very strange virtual pet:  Demon In My Pocket - Your very own desktop demon to love, care for and boil in oil. And to finish up, the Pack includes three desktop themes to use with Windows (if you have Microsoft Plus!, that is).
