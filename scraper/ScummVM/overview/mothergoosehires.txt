Mixed-Up Mother Goose was originally introduced by Roberta Williams in 1987 and became one of the best-loved children's software titles of all time. The child can pick from a range of characters to find the one that most resembles him or herself and the game uses a simple child-friendly interface. Following a re-release with the SCI engine with both EGA and VGA graphics in 1990, Mixed-Up Mother Goose Deluxe is the fourth installment of the game. Updated for multimedia computers, it has high-resolution graphics, digitized music and voice, and a host of new features.
