The game follows a knight named Sir Graham, who is given a task to find the magical stolen treasures of the Kingdom of Daventry (the magic mirror, shield and chest) by King Edward. If Sir Graham succeeds at his quest, he will become the next king of Daventry.

King's Quest is considered the progenitor of third-person-perspective adventure games. As opposed to earlier graphic adventures, the player is able to navigate the protagonist on screen in eight directions, creating an effect of three-dimensional exploration. The player character can also be obscured from view when hiding behind an object, is subjected to gravity, and has different animations for actions such as picking up an item, falling, swimming, etc. Graham can be moved around with arrow keys and perform various actions when the player types commands, normally consisting of noun and verb combinations (e.g. "Take flower", "Talk man", etc.).
