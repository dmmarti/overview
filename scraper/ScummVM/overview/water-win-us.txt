 In Water Worries, you play Luther, a young green fish who gets sucked into a whirlpool and must find his way out. Luther's search will eventually take him through 100 underwater levels jam-packed full of action and adventure. On the way home, Luther will need to be aware of the hazards around him, while picking up worm doodles which will allow him to advance further. Bubbles, which are constantly rising from deep within the whirlpool, will force the water level down if they are allowed to reach the water's surface. If the water level becomes too low, Luther will have to retry the level, minus one energy level. To prevent this from happening, Luther must use his trusty slingshot and unlimited supply of ammo to pop the bubbles before they reach the surface. Luther also needs to be careful when navigating the whirlpool, since running into a bubble may render him momentarily trapped and unable to fire his slingshot.
