 Future Wars is a sci-fi turn-based strategy game in the vein of classical TBS games like Battle Isle or Advance Wars. The rock-paper-scissors principle makes Future Wars easy to learn but difficult to master. The campaign mode, which offers roughly 8-10 hours game play, is about the young cadet Max and his buddy Bud going to the academy of the global forces, the most important military unit, where ambitious, young recruits trained to reach the top of the Armed Global Forces.  Beside a campaign mode the game offers several other game modes like Hotseat, "Play per mail" (sounds funny but it works), AI vs. AI etc.  Also the game offers a wide range of customizing possibilities: an easy-to-use editor to create own maps, the possibility to create your own textures and/or balancing sheets till even the possibility to integrate your own AI.
