 Bear Stormin' is one of the minigames in Putt-Putt Goes to the Moon. It is similar to the game "Circus Stormin'" from Putt-Putt and Fatty Bear's Activity Pack, except that instead of Putt-Putt donning a propeller and instead of the theme being a circus, it depicts a bear flying a propeller plane, and the theme is a farm.
