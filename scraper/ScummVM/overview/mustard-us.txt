 King Konglomerate, CEO of a mustard company, launches a series of robots to steal and destroy tomatoes so that he won't have to compete with his archenemy ketchup. From Florida to Egypt, SPY Fox must travel around the world with his Multiple Environment Spy Ship to save the world's ketchup supply.  The game itself is a straight-up side-scroller where you control your Spy Ship with either mouse or keyboard through 101 levels avoiding obstacles, shooting robots and collecting tomatoes. Like the other games in the Spy fox series, the game was built on the SCUMM engine.
