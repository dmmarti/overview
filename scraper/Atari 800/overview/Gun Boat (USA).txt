Twist down treacherous jungle waters with eight tons of firepower and the threat of a deadly ambush around every bend. Command a Navy River Patrol Boat (PBR) in the most hostile and claustrophobic action -- riverine warfare! First hone your critical combat skills with gunnery, grenade and pilot practice. Then report for duty and equip your boat with the hottest weaponry for the mission. Take out enemy craft with twin armor-piercing .50 caliber machine guns. Blast land-based positions with 40mm grenades or fire your 60mm Mortar Launcher and get ready to hit the deck!
