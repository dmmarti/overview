Just Another War in Space is a real-time strategy game in which the player participates in a space war. There are seven scenarios: five standard sets and two with expanded gameplay mechanics. In the first five scenarios, the player receives a ship which has to be used to defeat the enemy army. The player indirectly controls the ship by issuing commands from the command menu. There are about 29 commands available, including using shields or special weapons. Inertia is simulated. On the map are also neutral objects which become hostile if attacked.  In the last two scenarios, each war party gets a set amount of credits to build an army of ships. However, the player does not only buy pre-made ones, but gets to equip them manually. Each ship consists of a hull, pods and weapons, of course each with their advantages and disadvantages. The player can either takes control over all ships or let the AI handle all but one.
