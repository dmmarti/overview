A basic pinball game. If you've never played pinball, you hit 
a ball with flippers to try to get points. This game isn't a good replica 
because the physics are all wrong. The screen and ball scroll too slowly, 
the dynamics are way off (the ball it too heavy when falling and too light 
when rising), and even the 'lights' are a little off. These problems, along 
with the shoddy board, make it so that there is very little to enjoy 
about this game.
