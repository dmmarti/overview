It's World War II and naval battleships have come under attack by enemy plains. It is up to the skill of the gunners to shoot down the incoming enemies and protect the ship.
Air Raid: This is Not a Drill is a first person shooter. Players man one of the fixed gun positions (e.g. turrets) aboard an allied battleship. When the air raid sirens go off, enemy forces begin to approach by air and by sea. It is up to the player to fire on them and destroy these targets. The player has access to three different kinds of weapons: The main gun function fires bullets, there is a limited supply of missiles that deliver a stronger punch and finally there are depth charges to destroy enemy ships. By continuing to advanced levels, the player earns medals along with their score. Multiplayer is supported over a network to allow multiple players to man different turrets and protect the same vessel.
