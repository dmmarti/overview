Cribbage is a card game that has been popular for centuries. In this adaptation, you compete against the computer in a standard game trying to beat your opponent to a score of 121. Points are scored according to standard cribbage rules: The game gives you a beginner play mode where the computer scores all points for both of you, or an advanced mode (Muggins) where you each score your own hand and can claim any points missed by your opponent (calling Muggins).
