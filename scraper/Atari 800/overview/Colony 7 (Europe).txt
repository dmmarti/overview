Colony 7 is an arcade shoot 'em up published by Taito Corporation in 1981. It contains elements of both Taito's own Space Invaders and Atari's Missile Command.

The main innovation of Colony 7 was its extended weaponry arsenal.[citation needed] This gave the player the choice to change between several different weapons, with each one needing to be purchased separately as microtransactions through the arcade coin slot.
