Challenge Golf is a golf game with four courses (18 holes each). It uses the standard two-click control system: a bar represents the power the athlete puts into the shot and a line runs up and down. The player clicks when the line is at the desired place. After that, the same is done again for the snap of the shot. The only exception is when it comes to putting, then the field is shown from a top down view and the player has to choose the direction by choosing one of a few pre-defined positions. The power is determined the usual way.  It is important to calculate the wind in, which is also the only thing affected with the three difficulty levels. Other features are a handicap system, 16 clubs (change the parameters of the bars) and a replay system after shots.
