Get ready for a fun adventure filled with cartoon combat. In Sneakers, you play Apollo, a mouse who must lead his friends through a human-sized town to battle the enemy. You must protect your troops by directing their actions and throwing wind-up punches and flying kicks. While your small size lets you take shortcuts through small holes in the wall, it also makes a rolling apple as dangerous as a tumbling boulder. Only those with cunning and quick minds can leave victoriously.
