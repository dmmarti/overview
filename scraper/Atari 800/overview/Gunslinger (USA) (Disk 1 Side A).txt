You're back in the wild west in this truly action packed, graphics intensive game. Okay, so it's not really that exciting, but it's silly enough to be fun for about 5 minutes. The concept is similar to Combat. You try to shoot the other guy. If you hit him, he falls down. Game variations put different objects in your way.
