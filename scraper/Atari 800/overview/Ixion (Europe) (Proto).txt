tears across the floor of an arena, locked in combat with your opponents. But you can't just drive anywhere - there are gaping chasms in the floor, and more of the arena can fall away at any time! Worse still, you're outnumbered - two to one! Fortunately you have a special weapon at your disposal - the Kailo Sphere - which not only takes out enemies, but also rebuilds the arena floor, allowing you to span those deadly gaps.
During Combat Rounds, you must drive over glowing targets in order to spell out IXION high above the arena floor. If you survive long enough to do that, you enter a special Bonus Round where you must master the use of Kailo Spheres. Succeed, and you'll become a legend! Fail... and you'll be just another long-forgotten footnote in the epic saga of IXION.
IXION is a previously unreleased prototype (itself based on an obscure arcade game) finally seeing the light of day in cartridge form!
