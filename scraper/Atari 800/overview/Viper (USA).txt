The Sun League has been trying to fight back against the corrupted and oppressive Gar computer for many years. Now they have attacked a defense base. The only hope is for a Viper V droid to be sent in under your control to reactivate the planet's defenses.  To do this, you must find floppy disks that are everywhere in the station to reboot that evil computer! To complete this task, you must fight 33 types of little robots who attack you. The action is viewed in first-person 3D, with directional arrows on screen for movement and rotation.  There are 25 levels, each of which is automatically mapped as you explore it. Use turbolifts to get to them. Each object is managed by the game, and a notepad feature is provided to allow you to keep track of vital information.
