 Alien Attack is a Space Invaders clone where your craft sits at the bottom of the screen while aliens above move in formation across the screen getting lower. You must blast all the aliens while avoiding their missiles that drop down or you lose one of there lives. At the start of the game you have shields above your craft but will slowly disappear from being hit from your shots or the aliens missiles. At the top of the screen, a mothership moves across the screen and when shot gives you extra points. There are 9 speeds to choose from (1-9) with 9 being the slowest.
