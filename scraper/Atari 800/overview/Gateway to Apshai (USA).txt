Among the his personal items, you find a journal which indicates that somewhere in the house exists a portal to another universe. Your goal is to find it, and explore this strange other world. Can you find... the Gateway?  Like its predecessor (Forbidden Quest), Gateway is supplied with illustrated prints that provide clues not included in the text description.
