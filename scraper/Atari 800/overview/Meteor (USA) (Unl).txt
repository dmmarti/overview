Meteor is an educational title that tests the player's reaction time. The player is presented with a starry sky and must press any button as soon as a falling sky is spotted. The game will present the player with ever more crowded skies. When the player decides to stop the game will show a graph showing the different reaction times plotted out against the number of stars in the screen.
