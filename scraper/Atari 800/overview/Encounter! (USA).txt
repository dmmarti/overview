Follow me to a galaxy far far away where your starship is in orbit around a strange new world. You set off in a probe for the planet's surface to take a closer look. Mysterious obelisks litter the planet, clouds hover menacingly across the desolate plain, when suddenly your monitoring systems tell you that you're under attack. The Encounter has begun!
