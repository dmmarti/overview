A mix of Tempest and Asteroids, Axis Assassin has you piloting a space ship across a series of grids, blasting away at the Master Arachnid and his army. Armed with only lasers and a single Pulse Bomb per level (which wipes out all enemies on the screen), your ship can travel up, down, left, and right across the grid, avoiding enemies and the webs they weave. Destroy all the enemies and you'll be sucked down the grid and onto the next level. Release a Pulse Bomb when the Master Arachnid appears and you'll be transported to The Nest, where you have a chance to earn an extra ship.
