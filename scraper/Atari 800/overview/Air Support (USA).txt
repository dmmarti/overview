Strategy based war game set in the future where wars are fought in virtual reality. What this means is that you control your forces via a top-down map (like in the popular Battle Isle) but you can switch to a 1st person 3D wireframe perspective of your units for special missions.  The game boasted incredibly realistic virtual 3D which meant having to don the 3D glasses that came with the game during the wireframe 3D sections.
