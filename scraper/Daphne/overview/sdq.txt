 A witch steals your girlfriend, Isabella, and you, the heroic knight Don Quixote, must rescue her. You travel through odd rooms and outside scenes all animated with your mighty sword and your sidekick Sancho Panza who does nothing on your quest to kill the witch and rescue Isabella. Game Introduction The idea for this animated laserdisc game comes from the movies and novels about Don Quixote, the legendary Spanish knight. In this game, the character looks very young and does not have a mustache. Also, he has a sword for a weapon and his faithful sidekick Sancho Panza follows him around although he does nothing to assist the hero. An assortment of mythical creatures including demons, dragons, skeletons and so on are encountered throughout the game. The game ends when Don Quixote kills the evil witch and rescues Isabella.
