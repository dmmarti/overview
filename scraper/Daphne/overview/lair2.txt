 Time Warp is a port of the arcade sequel to the original Dragon's Lair arcade game. Players once again play Dirk the Daring, the brave and dashing knight, who, with a little bit of skill and a lot of luck, must once again rescue his princess, Daphne. This time, Daphne has been kidnapped through a "wrinkle in time" by the evil wizard Mordroc and it's up to Dirk to rescue her before she is forced into marriage. The game features every scene that was in the arcade version including scenes based on Alice in Wonderland and other classic fairy tales. The PlayStation 3 and the iPhone version have an original game mode as well as a Director’s Cut with a different ending that was not featured in the original arcade version. The Macintosh version also contains the Director's Cut ending. In the Watch Game mode the entire game can be viewed in full as a movie without input from the player.
