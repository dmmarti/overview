You awake slowly to bright lights. You are feeling confused as you look around the room. You cannot remember how you got here. As you begin to awaken you realize that you are tied down to the bed! As your eyes begin to focus you see a TV on the wall. It appears as if you're in a hospital room. Who are you, why are you here and can you escape?</Notes
