Battlemorph is the Jaguar CD sequel to the first Jaguar cartridge, Cybermorph.  This game takes place 30 years after the original.  The Pernitian empire, long thought to be extinct, is back with a vengeance.  Your new War Griffon craft must travel to 8 different star clusters so that your star ship can find the plasma it needs to make it's way to the Pernish cluster.  Once you take out the Pernish home world, the galaxy may be safe from the Pernitians once and for all.  Battlemorph plays similarly to Cybermorph, except with some new gameplay features.  Now, some missions require you to travel underground into caves and tunnels.  It is also possible to dive under the oceans on the planet's surface.  There are also many new objects, weapons, and enemies to interact with.
