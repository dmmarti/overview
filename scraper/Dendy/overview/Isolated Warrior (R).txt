Max Maverick is the last surviving member of his planet's special forces following a devastating alien invasion. Far from being discouraged, Max takes it upon himself to wipe out the alien menace single-handedly.

Isolated Warrior is a constantly-moving shoot-em-up, or shmup, where the hero is always walking or flying forward from an isometric overhead perspective. The hero has a basic laser gun to start with but collects powerups that can allow the gun to fire in multiple directions. He can also collect bombs that can be launched in multiple directions while jumping, as well as shield powerups.
