Billed as a pinball role-playing game, though the term is used loosely, as you only earn gold to buy stoppers and more powerful flippers.  Actually, there are four different modes of play.  The RPG-mode has six, multi-screen pinball tables, where you use your flippers to knock the pinball into enemies, find keys, and eventually rescue Princess Bali.  The other modes, POP!POP!, Viva Golf, and Circus, are each specialized multi-screen pinball tables involving sports, golf, and the circus.  The latter has a slot machine and a bonus game in which you throw balls at animals to save the girl they are chasing.
