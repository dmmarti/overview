This game involves the use of the Nintendo Light Zapper, and has, truly, no plot. You are in the police station doing target practice, either with three targets at a time with at least one innocent person, or in an alley with both good and bad targets in windows and walking on the sidewalk. Then there's Trick Shot, where you shoot the cans, trying to make them land in a slot for points, or at least not let them fall to the ground.
