Widget is a game about a perpetually smiling purple alien who must save earth from a gang of alien invaders. The action consists of side scrolling jumping and shooting. However, Widget has the capacity to transform into a variety of other creatures and objects ("widgets") which have application in different situations. These alternate widget forms include a cannon, a mouse, a rock-man, a bird-man, and a dolphin. Transforming uses up magic points which must be replenished. Widget also communicates with a helper named Mega Brain via a wristwatch device.
