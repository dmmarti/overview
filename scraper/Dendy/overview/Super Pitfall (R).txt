Pitfall Harry returns to adventuring in this �Super� sequel to Pitfall! and Pitfall II: Lost Caverns. Harry�s mission: to recover the famed Raj Diamond, and also to rescue his niece Rhonda and loyal lion sidekick, Quickclaw.  

Now armed with a gun, Harry must navigate some 270 screens of 8-bit action-platforming. Valuable items will be collected along the way to aid your quest, but beware: dangers also abound, from snakes and spiders to falling rocks and boiling lava!
