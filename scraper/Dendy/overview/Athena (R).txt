Athena, the Goddess of Wisdom, has grown tired of her life within the castle and ventures into the Fantasy World beyond the castle walls. Strange and fearsome creatures will attack you at every turn, but you will find weapons along the way: a ball and chain, a bow and arrow, and a mighty sword.  You can also put on wings and take to the sky, or become a mermaid to explore the ocean depths.
