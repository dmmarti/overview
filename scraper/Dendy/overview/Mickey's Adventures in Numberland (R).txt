Pete has just robbed Numberland of its 10 magical number molds. Sheriff Donald Duck needs to reclaim the molds and requests help from Mickey Mouse. Playing as Mickey you are tasked with collecting at least one of a specific number mold per level you are playing. There are five different locales which are Number City, Number Factory, Space Center, Number Museum, and Pete's Hideout. After a level is completed a basic math problem must be solved for the player to continue. The game contains three difficulty levels with only the super advanced mode allowing you to take damage from enemies.
