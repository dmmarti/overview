The villagers thought they were safe. But now it is time they learned the terrible truth... Frankenstein has risen, laid waste to the lands surrounding the village, has amassed an evil army of unholy creatures and even gone so far as to capture a young girl.

Frankenstein is a side scroller adventure against all sorts of nightmarish creatures. Some might even call it a clone of the more widely known Castlevania games of the NES. You begin the game with nothing but your fists... but may acquire a magical club from enemies. Finding additional powerups with give the club the ability to toss fireballs. There are treasure chests in various rooms as well as characters that can help you in your quest through dialog hints.
