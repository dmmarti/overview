Buster Bunny receives an invitation to a newly opened amusement park. He gladly accepts, unaware of the fact this invitation is a trap. Now he and his friends have to overcome all the obstacles and to survive in the Wackyland...

"Trouble in Wackyland" consists of several mini-games which you can complete in no particular order. You have to reach the engine of a train in a standard side-scrolling platformer, keep your balance on a wooden plank while diving down dangerous waterfalls, compete in toy car tournament, etc. Once you gain enough tickets, you can access the Castle, that is standing behind the Amusement Park.
