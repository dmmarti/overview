Released only in Japan, this Famicom version of Star Wars: Episode IV: A New Hope features a black-haired version of Luke Skywalker with full Jedi powers that goes through various adventures that are loosely based on some events that take place in the 1977 film.  Unlike any other game adaption of the film, this version takes several drastic liberties with the overall story and character meetings.

The game is a side-scrolling platformer that has Luke begin his travels on Tatooine.  While Luke eventually travels to the Death Star and Yavin IV, he travels to other planets such as Kessell, Iscalon, and Hoth to rescue his imprisoned friends before he flies his X-Wing fighter during the final Death Star trench run.  Along the way, he fights against Tusken Raiders, Stormtroopers, Boba Fett, and rides in vehicles such as his Landspeeder... or a whale on Hoth.

At the end of each level, there is a boss fight that squares Luke against Darth Vader look-alikes, who transform into various creatures such as scorpions, pterodactyls, sharks and more.
