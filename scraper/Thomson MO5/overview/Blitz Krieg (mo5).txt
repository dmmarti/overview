Blitzkrieg centers on 3 distinctive campaigns which features some of the major factions battling it out in World War II. The 3 campaigns featured the Allies (American and British campaigns), the Germans and the Soviets. Each of these campaigns attempt to chronologically re-enact the time periods of the war by devising Chapters into each of the campaigns.

These Chapters, in turn, feature smaller scale random (i.e. fictional) and historical battles. Random maps present an opportunity for the player to win upgrades for his side as depicted in the map description. Depending on the random map selected, the player may potentially bolster his forces with either artillery units or armored units.
