Children need strong math skills to solve today's and tomorrow's problems. The Milliken Math Sequences, along with the TI Home Computer, can help your child meet these challenges. The series allows children to work at their own pace and on the skill level at which they need practice. Children find that learning with the computer is fun, challenging, and motivating. The computer never tires of repetition or loses patience — it's like having a private math tutor! The Milliken Math Sequences, developed for Texas Instruments by Milliken Publishing Company, consist of twelve Solid State Cartridges. Each cartridge concentrates on a different skill area in mathematics, such as addition, subtraction, decimals, fractions, or equations. By providing different levels of difficulty, the series is suitable for children from the kindergarten age through grade eight. The Equations cartridge is divided into 26 levels of difficulty, covering material generally taught in grades six through eight. This program introduces the concept of variables — finding the value of an unknown number N — in equations. It also provides practice with a wide variety of skills related to solving equations, including working problems in more than one step and solving equations by adding, subtracting, multiplying, and dividing. This program assumes that your child has mastered basic arithmetic and a certain degree of mental computation.
