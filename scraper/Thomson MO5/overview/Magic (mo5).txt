Macmillan Software

When the software has loaded, type in the password
  MAGIC
and then press the ENTER key to go on. The password prevents unauthorised
access to the secrets of your tricks!

Next type in your name. The curtains now open and the magic is waiting for you.
You have three options: TRICKS, SEQUENCE and SHOW.

TRICKS explains the secrets of the tricks; SEQUENCE allows you to select the
tricks you wish to feature in your show; SHOW is for your live presentation!

Now look at TRICKS. Choose from the names of the tricks scrolling up in front of you. For each trick, you have three options:
  THE MAGIC
  MAGICIAN'S TIPS
  REHEARSAL

It's best to go through each of these in this order, first to see how the trick
works, then to see how to present it as part of a show, and finally to practise
until you are perfect!

When you have rehearsed a number of tricks you will be ready to choose the
tricks for your show. Select SHOW and these options will appear:
  SEQUENCE A SHOW
  REVIEW A SHOW

Use SEQUENCE to choose the tricks and accompanying tunes for your show; REVIEW
to remind you of the order in which you have chosen them.

To add variety to your show, you can present tricks from the book [the
accompanying booklet includes a number of tricks] (or elsewhere) in between
computer tricks. Just leave the computer running - the curtains close after
each trick, and open again to start a new trick only when you press a key.

Press CAPS SHIFT and A simultaneously to return to the main selection screen at
any time.
Press O to switch the sound off or on.
