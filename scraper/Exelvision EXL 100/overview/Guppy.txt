Guppy is a Pac-Man variant where the player controls a fish while the ghosts have been replaced by octopuses. The player's task is to collect all seeds in the maze and avoid getting killed by the octopuses. In the corners of the maze are magical algae which when eaten allow the guppy to go after and kill its pursuers for a short while.

There are three difficulty levels and each contains four stages. Each stage consists of two mazes with different layouts: first a simple one and then a more complex one. In the last stage the maze walls are invisible. There are three different octopuses with different movement speeds: blue, green and red. On the easiest level there is for most stages only one octopus (initially the slow blue one) while on the hardest there are up to three ones in motion at any time.
