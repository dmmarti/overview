Dodge Cars is a simple racing game. The game is viewed from a top down perspective and the player races down a road consisting of five lanes. From the opposite direction comes countless cars and the aim is to drive as far as possible without crashing. The cars move automatically forward at a steady pace and all the player has to do is to move right or left between the lanes. The player gets a score based on how far down the freeway he gets. The game is controlled with a joystick.
