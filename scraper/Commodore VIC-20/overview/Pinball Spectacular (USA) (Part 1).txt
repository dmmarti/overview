The flipper simulation is a mixture of pinball and breakout. The square-cut ball is rolled over the pinball table with the help of a double board similar to Breakout. As pinball elements, there are -next to walls- also two bumpers (upper right and left), the Commodore logo (in the middle of the screen), the light C O M M O D O R E with the corresponding targets, two spinners, four sideways ball traps (middle and bottom) and a point display. Furthermore, there is a time-sensitive ball barrier to avoid the ball going into out. The overview line with ball display, active player and points is in the first line of the screen. You have 3 balls per game.
