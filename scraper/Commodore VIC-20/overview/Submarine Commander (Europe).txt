Your mission is to destroy all enemy merchant shipping in Mediterranean waters. You have Sonar to help you find them when you are submerged.    If you are attacked you can dive deep (not too deep, or the hull will crack) and try to dodge the depth-charges; then you can rise to periscope level for another attack on the convoy.    But check the instruments for your oxygen level, fuel, battery charge, depth under your keel, and watch out for enemy destroyer, or it may all end in disaster!
