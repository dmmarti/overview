Part of the K-Tel "Double Sider" Range. Two games are included on one tape. Supavaders is a Space Invaders type action game where you move a space ship left and right shooting enemies that come from the top of the screen. Although the player can only move left and right, they can fire up, down, left, or right. If the enemies make it past you to the city beneath you must shoot downwards to destory them.</Notes
