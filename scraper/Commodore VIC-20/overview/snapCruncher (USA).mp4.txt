Following Atari's lawsuit which pulled HAL Laboratory's Jelly Monsters from the shelves shortly after its release, Commodore themselves designed this modified "clone" called Cosmic Cruncher. "Pac-Man" was replaced with a giant Commodore logo, the ghosts were replaced with aliens, the cherry was replaced with a planet/moon, and the power pellets were replaced with mini space ships.
