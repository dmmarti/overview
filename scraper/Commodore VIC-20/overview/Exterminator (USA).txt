The Exterminator is essentially a clone of the arcade game Centipede. A centipede forms from the top of the screen and gradually moves down it, changing direction when striking the many barriers it hits. If it reaches the bottom of the screen, it wins. You control a small droid, which can move up the screen shooting out the centipede, cutting it shorter each time). You can also shoot the barriers, which take multiple hits to remove - the less barriers there are, the longer it will take for the centipede to reach the bottom.
