The Catch is a single screen action game similar to the arcade game Avalanche. The player controls a force field over a number of cities and has to protect them by catching bombs that are dropped by an alien. The alien moves back and forth across the screen and the player has to follow it by moving left and right. The cities are destroyed as they are hit by bombs and the game goes on until there are no cities left to defend. The attacks come in waves with the speed of both the bombs and the alien increasing with each new stage.
