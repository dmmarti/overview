Xeno II is a game that consists of four different single screen games with three being shooters and you have to complete each screen to move to the next with three lives. The first game has you sat at the top of the screen in a spacecraft viewed from the side and you have to land on a pad at the bottom of the screen while contending with gravity and rocks. You can move your craft left or right, and stop for a couple of seconds but when you stop this uses energy. As you fall you will speed up and if you hit the pad too fast then you lose a life. Moving across the screen are rocks and these have to be avoided or you will also lose a life.
