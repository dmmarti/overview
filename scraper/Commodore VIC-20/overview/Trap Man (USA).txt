	Man Trap is a deceptively simple arcade game for the Spectrum where the objective is to survive for as many levels as possible. There is no save game. The player has only one life per game, a single mistake and the game must be replayed.    The player's character starts off at the bottom of the screen. The object is to get to the top of the screen by jumping on to platforms. Only one unused platform is shown at a time and the player must jump either left or right to reach it.   If the player jumps the wrong way their character dies and the game is over. The same happens if the player takes too long to make their jump. Fast reflexes are a must in this game.    On later levels some platforms have man traps on them - hence the game's name.
