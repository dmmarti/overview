Super Amok is a variant of Berzerk (and an enhanced version of the original Amok).  Amok is also the name of a space station located far out in space that the player has to make his way through. Like in Berzerk, the player controls his character from a top down perspective and can move and shoot in multiple directions. Each room is inhabited by a number of robots that have run amok and are trying to kill the player. In addition to the robots the player also has to avoiding running into walls that will kill him upon contact. The robots have different colours (green, blue, red, black) that indicate how many points they are worth. Green are worth only five points while the black ones are worth 35. After scoring 1500 points the player earns an extra life. The game consists of nine skill levels.
