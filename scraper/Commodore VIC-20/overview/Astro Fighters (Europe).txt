A two-player only game set in outer space, where one player controls their Astro Fighter with the joystick, while the other controls theirs with the keyboard. The object is to eliminate the other as many times as you can before time expires. Obstacles such as Proton Stars, hostile planets, and other space debris also need to be avoided. A time limit (between 1-9 minutes) is set before the game.
