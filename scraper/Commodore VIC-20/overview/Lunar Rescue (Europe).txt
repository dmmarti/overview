Lunar Rescue (ルーナー・ レスキユー Runā Resukukyū) is an arcade game released by Taito in November 1979. The gameplay has some resemblance to both Taito's own 1978 hit Space Invaders (and is sometimes listed as a Space Invaders spin-off) and Atari's Lunar Lander (released just several months earlier).</Notes
