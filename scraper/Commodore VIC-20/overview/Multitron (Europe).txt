In this modified take on Space Invaders, you have to get through six waves of aliens that have different attack formations, and dodge their projectiles by moving left or right. Your only line of defense is your built-in cannon capable of firing three shots at once. Pay attention to the energy meter next to your score, because if it is too low, your firepower will be restricted. If you are hit by any of the projectiles, you lose one of your three lives. Once you have completed all six waves, you are placed in a bonus wave where the object is to navigate a road that moves in a zig-zag pattern. After that is completed, the game restarts on wave one, but with a higher difficulty setting. The game ends when you run out of lives.</Notes
