Safecracker is a 1997 puzzle adventure game developed by Daydream Software and published by GT Interactive. Assuming the role of a security professional, the player infiltrates the headquarters of a safe manufacturer and attempts to break into 35 of its unusual models. Each one is guarded by a different type of puzzle, including sliding tiles, anagram codes and translations from braille. The player's progression is nonlinear: the mansion can be explored, and its safes unlocked, in multiple orders. However, the goal must be completed within a 12-hour time limit.</Notes
