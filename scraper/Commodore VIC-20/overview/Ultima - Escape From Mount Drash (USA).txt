You have been imprisoned by the Garrintrots in the mountain stronghold of Mount Drash. There are 15 levels of tunnels within the mountain, and you must find the exit in each one to escape. Some levels have gems which must be collected before you are allowed to leave. Along the way you will encounter a variety of enemy creatures which will need to be defeated in combat. Only released for the VIC-20, it is a simple maze game with some monster battles, and very little connection to the other games in the series.
