The play mechanic is a mix of many games; protecting your ground-based city with a moving crosshair is obviously Missile Command.  However, the asteroids that drop on you break into two and then four pieces as in Asteroids.  And the force field over a cityscape looks a lot like Imagic's Atlantis game.
