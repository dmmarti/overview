In the desert, the giant cactus is now becoming extinct and it is your task to save one of the last few that remains in this single screen shooter. Viewed from the side, you control an insect/gun that sits on the bottom of the screen underground with the cactus in the middle of the screen. Through two holes in the ground you must blast the wasps and hornets that move across the screen advancing downwards, either side of the cactus, to stop them eating the bottom of the cactus. As you blast the insects, they will drop droppings which are acidic and dissolves part of the ground and must be avoided by yourself. You are able to go onto the surface but you can now be hit by an insect if it gets to ground level, and also a mole moves underground filling in any holes and can leave you trapped on the surface of the ground. If you get hit by an insect, it's droppings or a mole then you lose one of three lives. It is game over if you allow the base of the cactus to be eaten or it falls over from the ground being dissolved.
