Alien is a game inspired by the movie with the same name but without a license. The game takes place aboard the transport ship Nostrodamus and the player's objective is simply to destroy the alien. The game is viewed from a top down perspective where the whole ship is visible. The player character and the alien are represented by flashing squares although the alien is only visible when within ten moves from the player. The player can also see various letters that represent weapons although the player won't know which weapon is which before picking them up. To attack the alien the player has to pick up a weapon and then use it in the direction of the alien. The player can only carry one weapon at a time and won't know what effect it has until he has tried it out on the alien. Once the action has taken place the weapon is automatically dropped and another weapon has to be picked up and used to further damage the alien. The player has four crew members and when they have all died the game is over.
