Gold Fever! is an action game with platform elements in which the player controls a miner searching for gold. At the beginning of the game the miner is at the uppermost tiers of the mine. Scattered around the five levels of the mine are little piles of gold. The goal is to move towards them and pick them up. To move the miner safely from level to level the player steers him up or down the vertical shafts in the floors. There are complications, such as runaway ore carts, which interfere with the miner's progress by knocking him down. Three collisions and the player is out of miners, ending the game. The miner will be able to jump over the obstructions if the player times the jumps perfectly. This adds from 30 to 40 points to the player's score. If the miner can cross a chasm by running across a boxcar, he earns another 20 points.
