Crazy Kong is a single screen platform game based on the arcade game Donkey Kong where you have to get from the bottom of the screen to the top to rescue your girlfriend over various screens. The platforms are connected by ladders and as you climb and move up the screen, a giant ape on the top of the screen rolls barrels along the platforms towards you. You must jump over the barrels or you lose one of three lives if you are hit but there are hammers that can be collected and smash the barrels for a limited time. As well as getting to the top of the screen to get to the next screen you must also collect all the diamonds on the screen
