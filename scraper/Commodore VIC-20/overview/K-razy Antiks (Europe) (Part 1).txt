CBS Software produced this game for Atari home computers, among others. 
 
The player controls a white ant, who must infiltrate an enemy ant hill to defeat the other 3 ants. The player and enemy ants have the ability to lay eggs, and if they are killed, they will rehatch with a new egg. If the player is killed when no viable egg is available, it is game over. The goal is to have all 3 enemy ants killed by environmental dangers, while also eliminating the eggs they lay, so that they don't respawn. Dangers include flooding, which will kill all ants at the bottom of the screen, and an anteater which will eat all creatures he can get his tongue on. When an enemy ant dies without an egg on the screen, they are placed in the ant trap in the center of the screen. When all 3 ants are eliminated, the player moves on to a more difficult level. There are 6 different mazes available. The player starts with 40 eggs, and receives bonus points after each stage depending on how many eggs they have remaining
