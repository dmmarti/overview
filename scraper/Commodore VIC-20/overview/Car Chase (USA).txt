Car Chase is a clone of the arcade game Head-On. It's a racing game played from a top down perspective where the player's car automatically moves forward on a circuit consisting of four lanes and the player can increase and decrease the speed as well as switching lanes at the middle of each straight. The player's job is to collect all the dots that lie scattered around but this is made hard by the jam cars that move in the player's opposite direction and attempt to crash into him. The game is over after three collisions and a level is cleared once all dots have been collected. If the player is successful with clearing two levels and has less than ten dots left on the third, the dots will turn into diamonds when the AI car runs over them. These will then be worth extra points when collected.
