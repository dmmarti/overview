In this game, a horde of mosquitoes attacks you and your only weapon is a chemical spray. One bite from a mosquito and you are dead. You are in a maze visible from the top. The game consists of four screens. To go to the next screen, you have to find a key. The maze sometimes goes black to harden your challenge. Find the keys to replenish your spray and hope for the best.
