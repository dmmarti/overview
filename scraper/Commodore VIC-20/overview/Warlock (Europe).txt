Warlock is a game which played much like Ghosts and Goblins. The player has to find the ancient relics which are needed in order to beat The Unspeakable One. When the player kills enemy characters in the game they will sometimes drop powerups including vitality (health), power (magic), armor, treasure (points), and mystery (often bad things).
