	Those 8-bit computers aims to play a mean pinball in this early release. There is a single table, featuring 2 sets of flippers at the base, and 4 bumpers on each side, allowing for multiple ricochets. Above these are a set of scoreless bumpers, each of which has a gap in between and a letter above, which spell out 'Sagittarian' along the top - hit them all to turn them into bonus lights. An accumulating bonus is also kept, which increases in increments of 50. Sticky bonuses are also provided, and hitting the 'hi' one often enough increases the value of the bumpers
