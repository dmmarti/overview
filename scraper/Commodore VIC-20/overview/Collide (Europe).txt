Collide is a variant of the arcade game Head-On. Like the original game the player controls a car and has to collect all the dots on a race track that consists of four lanes. The car automatically moves forward counter-clockwise and an enemy (which here is a happy face) moves in the opposite direction trying to crash into the player. Changing lane can only be done at intersections located in the middle of each straight. Hitting a divider when doing so will lead to the player losing control of the car for a short moment. The player has three cars and when they have all been crashed the game is over.
