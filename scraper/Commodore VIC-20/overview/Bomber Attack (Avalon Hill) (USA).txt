Bomber Attack is a classic side scroller. The player pilots a bomber flying to the left, dropping bombs on enemy defenses below. The player's control over the bomber's movement is limited to going up or down. The player must drop 25 bombs without hitting any hospitals. The bomb run must be completed under fire from ground defenses and scrambled fighters sent to intercept the player's bomber.
