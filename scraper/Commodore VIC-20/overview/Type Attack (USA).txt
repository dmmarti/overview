A Space Invaders inspired typing game. Letters slowly descend from the sky, type them in order to destroy them. Any letter that is at the bottom of a column is a valid input; mistakenly inputting another drains energy. There are 99 speeds (Anything above 80 requires a genetic mutation), and 39 lessons. These can include upper and lower case, symbols and special keys as options. Each lesson finishes with a sequence of words using the featured letters, to be input in as little time as possible, allowing for use of the delete key. Score is based on WPM, letters destroyed, minus mistakes. There is a savable high score table plus you can save your game at any time. The package includes finger placement diagrams for all variants of the host platform.
