Moon Patrol is often credited with the introduction of parallax scrolling in side-scrolling video games. Taito's Jungle King side-scroller, released the same year as Moon Patrol, also uses parallax scrolling.  The player takes the role of a Luna City police officer assigned to Sector Nine, the home of the "toughest thugs in the galaxy". The player controls a Moon buggy that travels over the Moon's surface, viewing it from the side as it moves towards the right side of the screen. While driving it, obstacles such as craters and mines must be avoided, and various enemies such as UFOs from above and tanks on the ground must be shot down.
