In Bullet the player takes the role of a bank robber who has the chance to rob four banks. The game consists of two parts. The first part is a clone of Head On. The player races his car through a maze consisting of three lanes and has to pick up all the coins that are scattered around. In the opposite direction comes a police car that the player has to avoid crashing into. Once all coins have been collected he gets the chance to rob the bank. This is the second part of the game and is most reminiscent of a snake game. The banks appear on the screen one at a time and the player has to drive over them. At the same time the car leave a trail that the player has to avoid crashing into. The player has four lives to complete his task.
