The Perils of Willy is a cut-down VIC-20 version of Manic Miner. The premise is that Willy is returning home from the party and while walking through the park he needs to skip lightly over the ducks and catch notes of music that seem to hang in the air. It includes 33 levels of platforming were pixel perfect jumps will allow him to reach hard to reach places and avoid nasties that are after him. Platforms below can crumble and conveyor belts take him closer to his destination or doom.
