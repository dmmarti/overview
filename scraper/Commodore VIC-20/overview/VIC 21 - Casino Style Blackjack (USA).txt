Casino Blackjack allows up to five players to play blackjack against a virtual bank. Players play in turns and can bet, hit or fold, double down (double the bet, but only receive one extra card), insurance bet (when the dealer starts with an ace) and split pairs. The players can also count cards, because the game remembers which cards have been used. After a certain number of hands the deck is shuffled again, or the player can order it to be shuffled at any time.
