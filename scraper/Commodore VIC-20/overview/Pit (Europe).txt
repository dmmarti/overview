In Jupiter Defender, the object is to move your ship across a landscape, killing aliens that approach it from the right with your built-in laser. The ship is also equipped with a number of bombs, which can be used to wipe out everything on screen. Coming into contact with the aliens results in a loss of life, and the game ends when all lives are lost.
