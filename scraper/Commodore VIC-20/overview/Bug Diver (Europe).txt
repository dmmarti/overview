Bug Diver is a single screen game viewed from the side where you are a bug who has to keep diving to the bottom of the sea to retrieve eggs. You start on the top of the screen and you must swim down to the bottom of the screen to pick up an egg while avoiding fish who are swimming to the left or right. You can move in four directions and when you reach the egg then you must swim back to the top of the screen where you then go back for another one. After collecting a couple of eggs the fish grow in size and if you touch any fish then you lose one of three lives.
