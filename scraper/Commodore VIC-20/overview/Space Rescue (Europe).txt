Space Rescue is a variant of the arcade game Lunar Rescue. A crew has been stranded on a remote planet and it is up to the player to rescue them. This is done with a shuttle craft that is dropped from a mothership at the top of the screen. The player has to steer the craft through a stream of meteors and reach one of three landing pads at the surface. There are four crew members and for each landing two enters the craft. The player then has guide the craft back to the mothership. A gun can be used to destroy meteors but the ammo is limited. Unlike the arcade game shooting can be done in both directions but this version does not have a thrust mechanic. There are four shuttles available and after crashing with all four the game is over.
