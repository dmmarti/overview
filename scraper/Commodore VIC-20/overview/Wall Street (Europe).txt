Wall Street is a text-based stock market simulation, where the object is to buy or sell shares in an attempt to make your first million. You can watch the plot of the day's trading within 30 days. During that time period, pressing a key on the keyboard brings up an option screen where you can buy or sell shares, or review your history. At the end of the 30 days, you can either keep going or continue beyond that.
