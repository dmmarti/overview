In the last few years of the 19th century many young adventurers travel to Africa in search of diamonds. One such young man is Englishman Ricky Rockman who aims to dig his way through the mines and return home with plenty of riches. It's not an easy job though. Not only has he watch out for falling boulders but also the vile creatures that patrol the mines.     Rockman is a Boulder Dash variant. The aim of the game is to collect all the diamonds for each level. Throughout the levels are also boulders and monsters that wander around. Boulders follow the laws of gravity and fall down when the player digs a hole below them. The player then has to be quick or he might be crushed by them. Boulders can also be used to kill the monsters. When all diamonds in a level has been collected a gate leading to the next will open. The player has three lives and they will be used if he comes into contact with a monster or is crushed by a boulder. There is also a time limit.
