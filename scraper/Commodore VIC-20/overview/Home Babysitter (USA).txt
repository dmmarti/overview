The cartridge includes sections on counting, learning your ABCs, and assembling funny faces on the screen. Small children will need some adult help to get started. Once they know the keys to press (remember that pressing RESTORE takes you back to the main menu, for one) they may do just fine on their own.. Basically a series of educational mini-games aimed at primary school children and pre-schoolers.
