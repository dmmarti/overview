Critical Path is a post-apocalyptic interactive movie adventure video game developed by Mechadeus (now Mondo Media) and published by Media Vision Technology. Critical Path featured real time video which made it appear to be graphically superior to most games of its time. In actuality, the entire game was an interactive movie, where most choices would simply cause the game to progress or end.</Notes
