Golf (ゴルフ, Gorufu) is a sports-simulation video game developed and released by Nintendo in 1984 for the NES in North America and Family Computer Disk System in Japan. The golfer has been indentified as Mario in supplement materials, albiet not wearing his traditional shirt and overalls. However, the game Captain Rainbow would instead identify the golfer as Ossan which happens to be the one of the generic internal name Mario had during the development of Donkey Kong. Additionally, the Game Boy conversion of this game would feature Mario on the Western cover art, but not the Japanese version.</Notes
