Attack of the Mutant Camels (better known as Matrix: Gridrunner 2 in Europe) is the sequel to Gridrunner. In this Centipede style game you play a retired captain of a starship, one of those who had won the previous war against aliens. You come out of retirement because the aliens are back, tougher than ever. Thus a second gridwar begins.
