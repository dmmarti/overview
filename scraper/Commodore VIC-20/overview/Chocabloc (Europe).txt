Chocabloc is a clone of Pengo, in which you control a penguin who is put into a maze of ice blocks. Gold eggs appear and hatch into a Chocbee that will roam around the maze at their will. Your job is to slam ice blocks onto them to destroy them. Once you have killed enough Chocbeez, you will proceed to the next level. As well as crushing enemies, you can align three choc-bars in a row for a bonus score. Coming into contact with a Chocbee will result in a loss of life, and lose all your lives and the game is over.</Notes
