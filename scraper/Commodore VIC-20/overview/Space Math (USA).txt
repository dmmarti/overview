Space Math is an educational game where the player is the captain of the starship USS Victory. The ship is located on the right side of the screen and the player's job is to defend it from the missiles that are launched towards it from the left. Each missile has a math problem on it and to take them down the player has to type the correct answer before it reaches the starship. If successful the player earns some points and if not they are lost. Once the game is finished the player gets a positive or negative message depending on well he has scored. It's possible to choose normal or fast speed and which of the four arithmetic operations to include.
