Bomber is a Blitz variant with some changes made to the original game concept. Like before it is a one-button game where the player has to drop bombs from planes but instead of a city there is instead a canyon full of various objects that has to be hit. This version features three different aircrafts that fly at different heights and appear from both sides of the screen. Unlike previous variants the planes do not get progressively closer to the ground and can not crash. Instead there is a time limit of two minutes and the player's task is simply to clear as much of the canyon as possible before time runs out. The game can be played with or without gravity. The difference is that with gravity bombs will clear more objects if they are dropped from a higher attitude while without gravity there is always only one object being destroyed.
