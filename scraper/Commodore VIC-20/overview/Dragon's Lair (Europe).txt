	The first port of the popular arcade game Dragon's Lair to a home computer, featuring the infamous Dirk the Daring.    The game, as one would expect from the long-running Dragon's Lair series, has mixed gameplay, including platform, puzzle and arcade (in the old-fashioned choose-your-path sort of way).    This first port includes two adventures- the first is to raid the lair of Singe the Dragon (hence the classic name) and rescuing Princess Daphne, and the second, in a sort of instant sequel of the first chapter, features Dirk trying to escape from the castle, now overrun by the Lizard King and its minions.
