You are Spike, climbing against time. Rather than following the safer way of the path, you may decide to climb the cliff instead... but such a decision will change your speed and your technique. Completing 5 different screens will take you to the top of the mountain, but beware of diving eagles, and hungry bears that hide in darkened caves. You must also watch for rock slides and slippery ice patches... they may send you sliding, perhaps into poisonous mountain cactus. The higher you climb, the colder you'll get. 
So hurry... before you freeze!
