Scrambler is a variant of Konami's arcade game Scramble. The player is in control of a jet that automatically flies forward over a side-scrolling mountainous terrain. The player's controls are limited to moving the plane up and down and there are two ways of attacking: shooting bullets and dropping bombs. On the ground there are different targets that the player should attempt to destroy. These include rockets that are launched when the jet gets close and fuel depots that when hit refill the jet's fuel. Running out of fuel, being hit by a rocket or crashing into the terrain leads to a life being lost. The player starts with three lives and gains an additional one upon reaching 20,000 points. The speed of the game can be set before starting out.
