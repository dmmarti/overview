Blowup is a single screen action game where the player has to collect as many dots as possible. The game is played from a top down perspective and the screen consists of dots, black blocks that limit movement options and bombs that denote when the player touches them. The player's task is to move over the dots to collect the most of them and reach the exit before a timer reaches 3000. When it does the bombs will go off and the player will lose. The same happens when running into any of the bombs. The player controls an arrow that keeps moving until hitting a block or the player changes the direction. It leaves behind a blue trail when moving which turn green when moved over a second time. The player should avoid moving over it a second time since bonus points are given for each green section of the screen at the end of a level.
