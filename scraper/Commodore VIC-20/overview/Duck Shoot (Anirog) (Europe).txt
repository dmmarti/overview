Duck Shoot brings you all the fun of the fair on a shooting range as you try to remove six plates at the top of the screen with your gun at the bottom of the screen which moves left or right. Above your gun are four rows with various items that either move left to right or right to left and you must remove all six plates to move to the next level. All the other items can be shot for bonus points but occasionally ducks will fly down and if they reach the bottom of the screen they will eat your bullets which are limited and shown on a bar below your gun. A duck will also fly across the top of the screen and if it reaches the other side of the screen then any plates shot will reappear. It is game over once you have run out of bullets.
