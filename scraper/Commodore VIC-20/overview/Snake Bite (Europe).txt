Snake Bite is a variation of the Snake type of games. The player controls a snake like object moving about the screen gobbling up randomly located objects along the way. Every object consumed increases the snake's length, one unit for each fruit and two for each bug. The perimeter is surrounded by a fence and mushrooms are strewn around the screen, both of which are to be avoided, resulting in a loss of life when hit. Once all crops have been consumed it is on to the next level. There are three difficulty levels, determining the speed the snake moves around the screen.</Notes
