Ludwig's Lemon Lasers is a simple shoot 'em up game where the player has to shoot down as many lemons as possible. The player controls an automatically firing laser gun that can be moved up and down along the right edge of the screen. An endless amount of lemons appear from the left and move towards the player's location. If a lemon makes it all the way to the right the game ends and the player gets a score. The game has a two player mode where the second player controls a gun along the bottom of the screen and the lemons appear from the top moving downwards.
