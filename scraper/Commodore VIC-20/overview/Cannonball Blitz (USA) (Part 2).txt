Cannonball Blitz is a game by Olaf Lubeck for the Apple II and released by Sierra On-Line (then known as "On-Line Systems") in 1982. It was ported to the VIC-20, and TI-99/4A computers. The game is a Donkey Kong clone, with cannonballs and cannons replacing barrels, and a soldier replacing the large ape. On the first level, the player character catches a flag instead of rescuing a girl.</Notes
