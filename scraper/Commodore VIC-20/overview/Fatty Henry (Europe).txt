In Fatty Henry you play as an octopus who is about to be cooked in a London restaurant, and Dan Warren wants to eat it! Of course, the octopus doesn't want to be cooked so it tries its best to put out the fire with water drops. The octopus should be careful though, as the flames will go up and later Fatty Henry, a dog, will annoy the octopus and if he touches it the octopus will die ... just like when anything else touches it.</Notes
