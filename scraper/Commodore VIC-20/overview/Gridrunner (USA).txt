In the year 2190, the humain race has set up a huge solar-power collecting power station in Earth orbit to beam power down to earth. Because of its lattice-like shape, this "power station is know simply as "The Grid". 
 
Shortly after beginning operation, the grid was found to be delivering less power than predicted. Investigation teams were sent into orbit. They discovered that the grid has been invaded bu alien Droids, who were using its power to reproduce themselves, massing for an invasion of Earth. 
 
To combat the Droids, a specialcombat ship was developped, the ship drew its power from the grid and, witc such vast amounths of energy readily availlable, was able to carry an awesomely powerful plasma cannon 
 
This ship, know as the Gridrunner, was so fast and powerful that, with skillful control, it could annihilate vast amounts of hostile Droids. 
 
We need you to drive the Gridrunner and save the earth!
