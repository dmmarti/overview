You have to explore an Azteque temple while avoiding the dangerous obstacles standing in your way. Each level is a different game, with different challenges and explorations, and even different views and scrollings! The game starts in subjective view or the player runs towards the pyramid while avoiding the spears. Once reached, the game goes in vertical scrolling or you have to climb the stairs avoiding huge rocks. Then, we explore the rooms of the pyramid, where lots of dangers await the player (including aquatic dangers!). A rich and varied game, which should delight exploration enthusiasts.
