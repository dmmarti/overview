Lode Runner is a 2D, non-scrolling platform video game first published by Brøderbund in 1983. Unlike later platformers which rely on precision jumping and movement, levels in Lode Runner are puzzle-oriented. It is one of the first games to include a level editor. Tozai, Inc. currently holds the copyright and trademark rights of Lode Runner.</Notes
