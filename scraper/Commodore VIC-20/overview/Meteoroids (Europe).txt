This is the prototype version of Suicide Mission:

Suicide Mission is a game very similar to Asteroids.  It even manages to simulate low-quality vector graphics.  The objects look rough, but at least they move very smoothly.  The background story involves a microscopic submarine injected into a patient to destroy viruses.  That would explain why these asteroids look like shape-changing amoebas.  Your sub has substantial firepower, so you can shoot several shots at once (nice!).  Your sub controls are similar to those in Asteroids, but instead of hyperspace, you have a shield, and thrusting gives you no momentum.  Suicide Mission isn't very original, but it's a perfectly respectable shooter with some innovative graphics.
