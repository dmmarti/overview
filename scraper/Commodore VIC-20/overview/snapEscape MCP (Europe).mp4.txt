In this game you play the role of a man who has been deatomized by a rogue 6502 processor and are now trapped inside the computer. The gameplay involves you running around a maze collecting both the key which opens up the exit for the level and also the program disk. The MCP is following you all the time and if it makes contact with you you lose a life. There are also walls and blocks which switch from visible to invisible making it harder to run as you can't walk through them.
