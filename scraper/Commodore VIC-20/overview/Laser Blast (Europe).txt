In Laser Blast, you control an intergalactic spacecraft, and you need to destroy enemy ground forces. Using your laser blasts, try to destroy the enemy vehicles which appear three at a time. But be careful, they are fully armed with their own lasers and have no intention of letting you take them out easily! The more enemy vehicles you destroy, the more points you earn. If you do get hit by a laser blast, your spacecraft will fall to the ground and crash. When hit you still have one last chance to take out an enemy by maneuvering the spacecraft to crash land on top of it.
