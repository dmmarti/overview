Alien Panic is a variant of Space Panic. Set in an abandoned construction site, the game is a single screen platformer where the player climbs ladders to move between the platforms while at the same trying not to get killed by the aliens that roam about. The player can kill the aliens by digging holes which they then might fall in. When they do so the player quickly has to fill in the hole and bury the alien. If not quick enough the alien will rise again. Once the aliens have been killed the player moves on to the next level, of which there are six in total. When the game ends (after all three lives have been lost) the player gets a score based on how many aliens have been buried and how long it took.
