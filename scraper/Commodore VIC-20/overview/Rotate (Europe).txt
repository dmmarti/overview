Rotate is a puzzle game in which the player must get his ABCs in the right order. The first sixteen letters of the alphabet are shown shuffled in a four by four grid. The player must get them in the right order by making rotations of two by two blocks. Also once per game the player may switch any two adjacent letters.  When the letters are ordered correctly the game will tell the player how long it took him or her.
