In Catcha Snatch, the player takes the role of the store detective Barney Bootlace. He walks around the store, which is represented with one top-down screen, to do his job: guiding lost children back to their mom, bringing lost items to the lost property office, busting shoplifters and rushing bombs out of the door. Practically this boils down to touching the item/person in question and walking to the destination.
