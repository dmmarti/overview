In this Galaxian variant for the VIC-20, you control a ship that moves left and right, and must shoot a group of aliens at the top of the screen, some of them swoop in on you at different intervals. The aliens have different classes, starting from the bottom row, and you score extra points if you manage to hit an alien in the top row. When you have cleared the screen of aliens, you proceed to the next wave. You initially start the game with three lives. Lose all of them and the game is over.
