A mad professor has planted a bomb in a sewer. You are trapped in his house and you have to escape it by collecting keys to open bars and get to the top of the screen, get through a jungle collecting keys to open the sewer and finally get down to the sewer, also collecting keys - but this time to defuse the bomb. The bomb will explode in a certain period of time, which the player can set at the beginning. 2 minutes, 2 minutes and 30 seconds, or 3 minutes.
