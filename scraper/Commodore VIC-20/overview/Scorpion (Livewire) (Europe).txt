Scorpion is a shoot 'em up with multi dimensional scrolling where the hero is a venomous scorpion searching for tasty frog eggs.You are required to move the scorpion through an insect and vermin riddled maze in his search. You will need to avoid predators like dragons, worms and Venus flytraps, and deadly mama and baby 'pod creatures'. The speed of your scorpion is better than most of your enemies, and the nasty stinger blast you have at your disposal is a rude shock to those after you, killing most instantly. These predators cluster around the target of your hunger, the frog eggs, and your stinger will often destroy the eggs you seek while you combat the vermin attacking you. These eggs are worth 3200 points each, and in the lowest levels you earn bonus scorpions by scoring 4000 points. You must bring back all four eggs before they hatch into crazed killer frogs which charge you with the intention of biting off your head. The best response is to stay clear of a frog until you have built up enough power in your stinger to immobilize him, then carry him back to your lair. There are 32 levels of increasingly quicker and more deadly vermin, and complexity of mazes.
