Mangrove is a single screen game where you have to protect healthy cells from cancer cells in the Mangrove Swamps while trying to create more. You start with 30 cells in the middle of the screen and from the edges appear the cancer cells, and with a sight you move it around the scren hitting the cancer cells to remove them. If a healthy cell is touched from a cancer cell then it disappears and because healthy cells have to be touching four others then any cells touching less than four disappear also. As you move the sight around the screen you create healthy cells but you only have a short time to get them to touch four cells or they disappear. You are armed with gamma radiation and when used destroys any cancer cells on the screen but you only have four but you do receive more after a certain score. If there are less than twelve healthy cells on the screen then it is game over.
