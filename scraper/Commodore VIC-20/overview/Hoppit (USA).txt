Hoppit is a Frogger variant which mostly resembles the river section of the arcade game. The player has to help a frog over a road in rush hour traffic but rather than avoiding vehicles they have to be jumped onto. The frog starts out at the bottom and has to reach the top of the screen by jumping between traffic islands, grass verges and trams that move across the screen. Falling onto the road leads to the frog instantly being killed by invisible vehicles that passes by and one out of three lives being lost. The player has one and a half minute to reach safety and will then move on to the next road.</Notes
