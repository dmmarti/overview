The player's goal is to raise up 12 frog eggs into adulthood, and ultimately produce their own offspring. These tadpoles must east algae to get larger and turn into frogs. These frogs can then lay their own eggs in turn. One of these eggs will be a prince egg, which will grow up into a frog prince. The player controls the direction of the tadpole swarm, and whether they scatter or congregate. When a tadpole reaches adulthood, the player can also control their tongue and choose when to lay their own eggs.
