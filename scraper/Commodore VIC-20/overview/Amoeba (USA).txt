Amoeba is a single screen game where giant amoebas have landed and are trying to take over the world. The amoebas appear on the screen in pods, each containing six of them. The player's task is to remove them by moving a laser probe over them which automatically kills them. It's necessary to be very quick about it though because with time they will start to multiply. After that has happened the amoebas can not be removed since any contact with them will lead to instant destruction of the probe and the game will be over. Amoebas that multiply stay on the screen throughout the game making it harder for the player to move around.
