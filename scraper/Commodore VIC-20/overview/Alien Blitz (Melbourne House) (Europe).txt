Alien Blitz is a clone of Space Invaders with no noticeable differences in design and gameplay. The player moves his missile base left and right and has to shoot down the alien intruders that move back and forth above him. If they reach the base line or if the player loses all his three bases the game is over. Four shields offer some protection and at times a flying saucer will zap past the top of the screen. Before starting a game the player can choose a skill level from zero to nine.</Notes
