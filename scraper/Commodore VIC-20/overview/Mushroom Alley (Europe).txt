Mushroom Alley is a single screen shooter inspired by the arcade game Centipede where you move left and right, and a certain distance forwards and backwards to protect your garden from various insects. You had planned to work on your garden, but after light rain overnight, the garden is full of mushrooms attracting the insects to nest, so you need to destroy the insects to protect your beloved garden. Insects appear from the top of the screen and move across the screen, and if they hit a mushroom or the edge of the screen, then they move one place down and move in the opposite direction.
