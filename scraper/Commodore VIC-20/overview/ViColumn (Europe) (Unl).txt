Single row columns three characters high descend from the top of the screen to the bottom of the screen where they begin to pile up. You cannot rotate the shapes at all, after all it is called ViColumn and all you are dealing with here are columns. You can, however, alter the order of the different coloured bricks which make up each column by pressing fire. Holding left or right on the joystick will move the column as it descends to the appropriate area of the screen and holding down will cause the column to descend faster.
