You (either a girl or boy, your choice) stand in a lonely graveyard outside Ghost Manor. A friend is trapped inside. You must find a way to enter the Manor and rescue the prisoner through 5 game screens. But beware! Unfriendly ghosts lurk behind tombstones; witches and goblins haunt the entryway; and demons and ghastly spirits may attack at any moment. It's very dark. Only brief flashes of lightning aid your search for the magical coffin. Remember...finding your friend is only half the game. You must then find a safe way out. Good luck!
