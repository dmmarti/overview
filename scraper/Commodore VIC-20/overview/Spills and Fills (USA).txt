Spills &amp; Fills is an educational game whose aim is to develop the skills of proportion, coordination and perception in children ages 6 to 12.

The player's task is to fill beakers with water using the least amount of fill ups and spilling as little water as possible. There are two kinds of beakers, the object beakers that have to be filled and the master beakers that are used to do it. To do so the player controls a crane that allows him to pick up master beakers and fill them with water from a faucet which then can be emptied into the object beakers. The game is completed when all of the object beakers are full. There are two kinds of scores for the player to keep track of, number of fills and the amount of water spilled. There are two different levels of difficulty. On level 1 all object beakers are the same shape but different in size, while on level 2 they differ in both shape and size.
