The evil magician Mordread has cast you into the haunted dungeon beneath his castle. He has turned you, once a might wizard into a magical key. You start out as a black key and the job at hand is to open the doors of the level by changing the colour of the key to the colour of the door. Unlocking a door can either reveal a a dead end or a passage behind that leads to a new part of the maze. The dungeon is occupied with ghosts that will chase you down and take one of your five lives if they manage to catch you.
