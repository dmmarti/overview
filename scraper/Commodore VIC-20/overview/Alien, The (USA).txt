You are trapped in a maze along with four aliens, which need to be destroyed by digging holes around the maze so that they can fall through them. Once an alien has fallen through one of these holes, you have a limited amount of time to seal it back up before the alien escapes. Once you have killed all aliens, you proceed to the next maze. You will be eaten by the aliens if you come into contact with them. Lose all your lives and the game is over.
