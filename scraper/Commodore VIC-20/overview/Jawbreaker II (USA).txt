Man! If you like Pac-Man, candy, giant spinning happy faces, more candy, Mozart (I think), teeth, moving horizontally....well....Jawbreaker II has it all! This is a fun game for the TI-99/4A, and was a sequel...I guess?...of the original Jawbreaker on the Atari 2600. Though related, the Jawbreaker for the Atari 400/800 was a Pac-Man clone, with the same theme of candy eating and tooth brushing.
