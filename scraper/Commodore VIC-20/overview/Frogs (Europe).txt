Frogs is a single-player action arcade game developed by Sega-Gremlin in 1978. It is the first video game with a jumping character (predating Donkey Kong by 3 years). The player controls a frog on lilypads and attempts to catch (with the frog's tongue and while jumping) various insects (butterflies and dragonflies) worth different numbers of points in a set amount of time.</Notes
