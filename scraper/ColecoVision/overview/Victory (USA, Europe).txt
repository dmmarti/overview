Victory is based on the Arcade game of the same name.  Use your Coleco Roller Controller to rotate your ship as the space around you scrolls by, smack your fire button to take out anything that moves and snag a power-up or two along the way to aid in your quest.  Similar in style to Asteroids, but with a moving background.
