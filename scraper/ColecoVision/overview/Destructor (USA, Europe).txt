Your starcruiser lands in the hostile city of Araknid to collect precious Crystals needed desperately on earth.  Your equipment: the mighty Ram-car.  Use your Ram-car to bump Krystaloids, transforming them into precious Crystals!  But watch out for the evil Destructor and deadly Insektoids, protectors of the Krystaloids!  Can you collect the invaluable jewel-like Crystals and fly home? 

This is one of the few Colecovision games to make use of the Expansion Module #2, the Steering Wheel Controller.

You steer your armored Ram-car through Araknid's maze searching for Krystaloid insects.  Ram them to form Crystals, then push the Crystals to the starcruiser.
