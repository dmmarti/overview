Amazing Bumpman is an educational game that focuses on teaching children number recognition and simple addition and subtraction.  After selecting your degree of difficulty you'll see a set of green numbers in the middle oh a hexagonal grid. The object of the game is to "bump" the screen in one direction or another (which also moves the green number) so that the green number is directly over the same number in white.  To bump a screen you must chew your way through all of the walls on one side of the screen which bumps it in the other direction. To impede you in this quest will be impassable hexagons in which you must instead shoot each side out with the "X" button. Be careful, you only have a limited number of shots.  Also, depending on the difficulty setting you selected, there will be numerous enemies hindering you. Some will attack you directly, others will chew threw random walls, possibly bumping the screen in the wrong direction, and others destroy the white numbers you're searching for.
