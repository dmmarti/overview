Far beneath the earth's crust, for a thousand years, a titanic struggle between good and evil has raged. The CAVE PHANTOM, an angry demon, wanders through the black caverns just below the surface — ever searching for a way to take revenge on the outer world after Merlin banished him to darkness Just below the PHANTOM'S kingdom lies Middle Earth, where friendly creatures called VUCUMUSES dart through the colorful stalactites and stalagmites Every 100 years, one brave VACUMUS is dispatched to the upper kingdom of the CAVE PHANTOM to keep watch and prevent it from spreading evil to the outer world. Today, the VACUMUS is SLURPY! SLURPY'S only strength lies in his long snout, which enables him to suck in and swallow nearly every living creature within the caves Now, the CAVE PHANTOM has brought to life a hoard of demon-mutants! They are multiplying quickly! And when their numbers grow to sufficient strength, they will pour out of all the caves on the surface, spreading poison and death! Your task — slurp up these viperous devils while avoiding their vicious attacks. And BEWARE —the CAVE PHANTOM is ever lurking — invisible — ready to strike!
