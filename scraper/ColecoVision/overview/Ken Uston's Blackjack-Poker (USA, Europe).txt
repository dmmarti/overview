Feeling Lucky?  Pull up a chair and play a few hands of Blackjack or Poker.  Minimum bet is $1 and maximum is $499 at the BlackJack table, whereas over on the 5-Card Stud Poker table the sky is the limit.  Up to 4 people can play simultaneously, or if you're a little shy you can always go one-on-one with the dealer.  Speaking of which, don't forget to give Max, your dealer, a nice tip, or you never know what kind of cards he'll deal out in your next hand.
