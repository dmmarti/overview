Choose any one of four background scenes and start to add clip-art objects, furniture and free form design. The four scenes are:
-Outside a mushroom house
-Inside a mushroom house
-The River crossing
-Gargamel's Castle

Create any number of decorated scenarios and then use either controller to change into one of four characters: Smurf, Papa Smurf, Smurfette or Gargamel and play around in the graphic you have created. Characters are able to move left, right, up, down... jump and drop.

There is no method of saving your work, so it all disappears when the power goes off.
