Albert Odyssey: Legend of Eldean is a traditional SNES-style RPG which features menu-driven, turn-based combat and 2D graphics.   The game tells the story of a human boy named Pike who was raised by harpies. When his harpy family is turned to stone, he has to take his father's sword, Cirrus, and leave the village for the first time to find a cure which will restore his family.  This game is the sequel to the original Albert Odyssey for the Super Nintendo Entertainment System. It looks very much like a SNES game, complete with the in-game cutscenes and mode 7 flying.
