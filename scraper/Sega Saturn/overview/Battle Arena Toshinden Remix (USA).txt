Toshinden Remix or Toshinden S as it was called in Japan is a port of Takara's Playstation fighting game Battle Arena Toshinden to the Sega Saturn by Sega.  It adds an additional secret character as well as a story mode for each character. These additions also hint at some of the plot twists in the game's sequel Battle Arena Toshinden 2.  The games graphics took a huge hit in the port; the Playstation version really does look considerably better. Though the character model and arena for the afore mentioned port exclusive character looks notably better than the ported graphics.  Toshinden Remix also redubs all the games voice samples with more light-hearted samples with over the top and arguably outrageous accents.  Like the graphics, the game speed also takes a huge hit in this port running considerably slower than the Playstation original.
