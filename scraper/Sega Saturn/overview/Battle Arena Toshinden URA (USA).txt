Battle Arena Toshinden Ultimate Revenge Attack is the second Toshinden game for the Saturn, following Battle Arena Toshinden Remix  Whereas Remix was a tweaked version of the Playstation’s  Battle Arena Toshinden, Ulitmate Revenge Attack isn't a tweaked version of the Playstation’s  Battle Arena Toshinden 2 but rather a new game.  It abandons the plot of the original Toshinden/Toshinden Remix and tells a new standalone tale revolving around the assassination of renowned warriors all over the world.  Like Toshinden 2, Ulimate Remix Attack adds 3 new fighters over its prequel; RonRon, Ripper and Tracy and three new bosses and secret characters bringing the total number of fighters to 15. The original Toshinden’s final boss and also Remix’s exclusive character have been removed.  Ulitmate Revenge Attack's game play could be described as a hybrid of the Playstation’s Toshinden 1 and 2 with movement like the former but the latter’s combo system.
