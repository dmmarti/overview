A collection of three of Sega's most popular arcade games of the 1980s, translated for the Sega Saturn - Outrun, After Burner II and Space Harrier.  In Outrun, get behind the wheel of your Ferrari and reach the checkpoints in time. Choose your destination as the road forks, and make sure you make it to the finish line before the timer reads zero.  After Burner II allows you to fly the most feared jet fighter in the skies - the SSF-14 - and annihilate the enemy. With two Vulcan guns, heat seaking missiles and an afterburner, as well as support from the crew of the aircraft carrier Sega Enterprise, the object is to shoot the enemy from the sky - before they get you.  Space Harrier is a shoot 'em up set in a fantasy future world. Armed with a gun and a jet pack, it is your job to rid Dragonland of the demon Absymbel and his evil forces.
