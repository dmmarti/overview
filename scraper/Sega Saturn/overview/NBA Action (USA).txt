NBA Action (reportedly once known as NBA Action '96) is a basketball game released for the Sega Saturn. It is part of the NBA Action franchise, though like its baseball counterpart, World Series Baseball, Sega chose not to give the first Saturn entry in the series a subtitle. It is technically the fourth entry in the series, following NBA Action '94 and NBA Action '95 Starring David Robinson on the Sega Mega Drive, and NBA Action Starring David Robinson on the Sega Game Gear. Unlike previous iterations, the Saturn NBA Action is displayed entirely in 3D. It would later be followed by NBA Action 98. NBA Action was once set to be released in the arcades, running on Sega Titan Video hardware. It was originally a Sega 32X game before being brought to the Saturn.
