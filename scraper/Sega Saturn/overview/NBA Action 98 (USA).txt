Sega's first attempt at Basketball on the PC includes plenty of neat visuals; realistic AI and motion capture work; official licenses of the NBA including players, teams and courts; practice mode to help you get used to your team; and a multiplayer mode (for up to 5 players on one computer). You can also create your own team and players in the edit mode, in case you don't like what the NBA offers.
