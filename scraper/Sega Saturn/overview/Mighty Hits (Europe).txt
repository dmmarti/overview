If you own the Saturn gun or mouse or if you're just looking for a party game, then look no further. Mighty Hits is the Saturn's answer to PlayStation's Point Blank. Up to 8 players can play against each other in this crazy selection of mini games. The quality of games is quite high with only one or two being a bit dull. Visually Mighty Hits is also quite impressive. I played this with the Saturn's mouse and gun and found it a pleasure to play. Playing with the standard controller is ok apart from some challengers such as the Bull's Eye one since that is too easy. This was released in the UK believe it or not so any Europeans reading this may want to look out for a PAL version.
