Shining Wisdom is the 4th game in the Shining series, but is completely different from the others. Neither a dungeon crawl like Shining in the Darkness, or a tactical battle RPG like Shining Force, the game plays very similarly to Zelda, with its action RPG elements.  The game proceeds by collecting various items found in dungeons and then combining them with magical orbs to create different spell effects that can be used to tackle enemies and solve the riddles that must be bested to beat each labyrinth.
