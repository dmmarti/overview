Bug's creepy-crawly insect friends need rescuing from the evil widow Queen Cadavra's clutches. Fight your way through six worlds to rescue them and find and defeat the spider queen. There are three levels to get through in each world of 3D platform action. Bug's key attack is his bug bounce but he can also somersault, spit and zap when powered up. The game also includes some simple puzzle elements.
