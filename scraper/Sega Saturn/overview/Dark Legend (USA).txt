Dark Legend or Suiko Enbu (Outlaws of the Lost Dynasty) is a one-on-one 2D fighting set in medieval China and based around the myths of the classic "Shuihuzhuan" Chinese story.  Select between a group of 11 fighters and clash against each other using your specific moves and attacks. Additionally, each character fights with his own unique weapon, but depending on how much you block your weapon can break and you must finish the fight barehanded and using a different moveset and generally faster (but less powerful) attacks.  Features the standard Vs head-to-head mode, as well as an Original mode which plays like the arcade original and a Special mode with arranged moves and tweaked balance.
