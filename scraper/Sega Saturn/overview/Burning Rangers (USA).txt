As a member of the Burning Rangers, it is your job to put out a range of fires and rescue those trapped in the heat of the blaze.  During each level, your quad leader informs you of the critical areas inside certain buildings, such as multi-level warehouses. Following his advice, you must use your cybernetic powersuit to put out the flames in each area. Along the way you will also come across boss characters, who are out to light up the town, and you. Your performance is then rated on your time to complete the objectives, how many lives were saved, and so forth. The better you go, the higher the rating.
