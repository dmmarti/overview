Corpse Killer is a full-motion-video (FMV) shoot-'em up. It seems the evil genius Dr. Hellman has found a way to raise the dead and created an island of zombies. The player is an elite special forces soldier who has been parachuted onto the island; it is up to them to shoot their way through the undead hordes and stop Dr. Hellman. The game is played from a first-person perspective. Various zombies pop up in front of a video background and the player must shoot them down either by moving a mouse cursor on screen or by using a light gun. The Saturn version has a few different features, including extra power-ups and additional enemy footage.
