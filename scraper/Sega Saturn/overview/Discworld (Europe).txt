This adventure game puts you in the shoes of Rincewind, a wizard whose sole purpose in life is to stay alive. He appears to be very good at it as well, because apparently the universe has decided to continuously challenge him.  The game takes place in the insane fantasy world created by Terry Pratchett, one of this world's most humourous authors, and is generally nuts.
