Virtua Fighter Kids is a modified version of Virtua Fighter 2 for Sega Saturn. All characters were left the same but the difference is that they are no longer adults but kids with traditional anime huge heads and short arms and legs.  A variety of new features has been added to increase the gameplay such as the ability to program specified moves for each character or new endings.
