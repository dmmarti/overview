Virtua Racing is a polygon-based racing game in which you must beat an opponent, who is either human or computer controlled. In the conversion to the Saturn, many new features were added:  1. 7 new tracks, which brings the total number of tracks in the game to 10. 2. 4 new cars, which brings the total number of cars in the game to 5.  The new cars are a go-kart, a Porsche 911, an F-160 racer, and a GTP-class car. 3. A new Grand Prix mode.  The Grand Prix mode is a career simulation.  You must work your way up from one class of vehicle to next be accumulating points in a series of races.
