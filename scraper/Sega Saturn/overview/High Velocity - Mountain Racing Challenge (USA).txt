High Velocity is an arcade-style racing game that allows you to drive sports cars on twisty roads around Japanese mountain tops.  There are 3 tracks on which to drive, each with forward and reverse routes.  You can choose from one of 6 different cars, each with different driving characteristics.  There are three different game modes:  1. King Battle:  You compete in one of 6 head-to-head races against the computer on each of the tracks.  Win all the races, and you are declared King of the Mountain. 2. VS. Battle:  You compete head to head against another player. 3. Time Trial:  You race for the best time around a course.
