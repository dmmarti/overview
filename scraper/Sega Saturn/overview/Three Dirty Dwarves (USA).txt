Three Dirty Dwarves is a side-scrolling action game with an interesting plot: genetically altered "super kids" playing Dungeons and Dragons open a portal that allows their "alter-egos" (the three dirty dwarves) to enter our world and try to rescue them from their evil Army Base captivity.  Once the dwarves arrive, they ransack the local "armory" (a sporting goods store) for weapons and set off to rescue the kids. The portal also lets in a number of fantasy bad guys too and they must be squashed on the way.  The main game mechanics allows the player to switch between each dwarf and uses its special attack (e. g. baseball bat and baseballs, bowling pins and bowling balls, and a shotgun). Additionally, there is the DwarfMorph" attack where the dwarves act as one.
