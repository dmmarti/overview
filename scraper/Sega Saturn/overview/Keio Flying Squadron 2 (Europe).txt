This is a crazy Japanese anime-style 2D platformer with shooting stages. The game features lots of different gameplay styles and some of the most bizarre bosses you will ever find in a game.  Its beautiful platform sections make good use of the Saturn's 2D hardware with scaling, rotation and transparencies. Your protagonist is Rami, a cute, scrawny blonde who dresses like a bunny and kills raccoons with a pink mallet.
