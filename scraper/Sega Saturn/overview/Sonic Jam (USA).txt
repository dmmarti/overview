A compilation of Sonic's greatest 2D adventures. Included on the disk is the original Sonic the Hedgehog, Sonic 2 (featuring Tails), Sonic 3 plus Sonic and Knuckles.  Each game has you taking control of Sonic (and later on in the series, Tails and Knuckles) who must use his speed to blast his way through level after level and rescuing his animal friends from the evil Dr. Robotnik. Along the way you will also enjoy 3rd person bonus rounds and take on a host of end of level bosses.  Exclusive to the Saturn compilation is the Sonic 3D museum, which allows you to control a 3D animated Sonic through a world full of historical information on the Sonic series, including behind the scenes, details on the characters from each game, artwork and more.
