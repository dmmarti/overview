Pinball Graffiti is a Sega Saturn pinball game developed by Pack-In-Video and released in 1996. Unlike its other Saturn rivals, Pinball Graffiti is rendered entirely in 3D, and can hence offer several interesting camera modes (such as a "ball cam") which most other pinball games are unable to provide. Pinball Graffiti has remained a Saturn exclusive and has not been ported to any other platforms as of yet.
