The Story of Thor 2 is the prequel to the game The Story of Thor on the Genesis/Mega Drive. The game is played from a top down perspective similar to most RPGs that graced the 2D consoles such as Zelda or Shining Force. You play a character who, along with being able to kick and slash his way about the place, also can use the powers of six elemental spirits (fire, water etc.) to both destroy bad guys and solve various puzzles.  The game features high-resolution 2D graphics which are much improved over its Genesis counterpart and CD quality audio. It really shows off the 2D capabilities of the Saturn system. The gameplay itself is not all that much different from the first game however and doesn't really expand the RPG components of the game. This series is very much an action-oriented RPG game.
