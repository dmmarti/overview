NHL All-Star Hockey 98 was billed as a sequel to NHL All-Star Hockey, however in many ways this is not strictly true - developers Radical Entertainment were signed up by Sega following successes with NHL Powerplay '96 for Virgin Interactive, so is realistically more of a sequel to that game instead, though both publishers would deny it.
