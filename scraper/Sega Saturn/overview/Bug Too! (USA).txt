Bug Too! is the sequal to Bug, a Sega Saturn game that was ported to the PC.  Bug Too! Is a 3rd person action/adventure platformer, and has lots of console-style play mechanics. You play as Bug and his two sidekicks, SuperFly and Maggot Dog. You go through several 3D worlds, all of which are parodies of movies. You must defeat the themed villans through all of the environments to make your homeland safe again!
