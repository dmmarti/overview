This is a very traditional turn-based strategy game for the Sega Saturn. It uses a hex-based map and features fog-of-war, weather, unit experience, unit upgrading, vehicles, and other goodies you expect in a realistic WWII simulation. It also adds simple 3d animated cutscenes showing what happened during each attack.  Originally developed for the PC by SystemSoft as part of their (still running) Daisenryaku (~Great World War) series of games, it was ported to the Sega Saturn by Sega for it's Japanese release. It was then licensed by Working Designs and translated to English for it's US release.
