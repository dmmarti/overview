The earth is overpopulated and mankind must find a second home. A ship sent to investigate Saturn and its moons has disappeared and you must go there to find out what happened.  The majority of the game is an FMV based shooter. These sections are basically a maze in which you will encounter various different aliens. Each alien has a weak point which you have to shoot.  There are also two 3D sections where you get to pilot your ship.
