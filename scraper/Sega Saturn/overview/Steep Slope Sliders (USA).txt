A snowboarding game in the CoolBoarders vein, this game sees you picking one of a motley crew of boarders and taking to the slopes as you try to get the best times and/or scores on each slope. With a range of tricks and courses, from Canada to Italy to Japan, as well as the option to play on a half-pipe purely for points, this game offers a fast-paced snowboarding experience that's easy for anyone to just hop into.
