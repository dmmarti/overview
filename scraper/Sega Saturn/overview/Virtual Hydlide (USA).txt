Virtual Hydlide is a 3D remake of the original Hydlide for the NES. You must defeat the evil demon Varalys, who turned a beautiful princess into three fairies. Before you confront the ultimate fiend, you must find the three fairies and restore the princess to her normal self by collecting three jewels.  You roam the 3D world of Hydlide, fighting monsters in real time, finding weapons and armor, descending into dungeons, hunting for treasure, and collecting points after defeating your foes, which you can then exchange for items. RPG elements are very slight, as you level up only after completing a portion of the game. You can also generate random maps by yourself and let the hero perform the same quest in your own world.
