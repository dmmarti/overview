Two young warriors, Notos and Ing, were traveling in a faraway country, when suddenly a giant woman-snake appeared in front of them. Ing escaped, knowing that Notos was probably killed by the monsters. Tortured by his conscience, Ing is found by a local young girl named Luna. But soon Luna and other young village girls mysteriously disappear, and Ing decides to help them however he can - not forgetting his quest for revenge against the snake...  Despite this RPG-like plot, the game is strictly a Japanese-style adventure. At every given screen, there are the standard Look, Talk, and Think commands. It is typically required to go through all the commands multiple times, obtaining the "Move" command and advancing the story.
