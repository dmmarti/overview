Star Luster (スターラスター Sutā Rasutā?) is a first-person shooter and space combat simulator video game developed and published by Namco in 1985 only in Japan. It is an arcade-style, combat-dedicated, sci-fi flight simulator that was first released for the Family Computer. That same year, Nintendo adapted the title for play in the arcade as part of their Nintendo VS. System.

The game's setting takes place in the UGSF universe, shared by other Namco games like Galaxian, StarBlade, Ace Combat 3, Bounty Hounds, and New Space Order. The game features free-roaming open space exploration, a cockpit view where the cockpit controls could be seen (and where the cockpit bobs up and down), bases where the player can be refueled, a map and radar displaying the locations of enemies and bases, a warp ability that allows the player to be warped to anywhere on the map, and a date system keeping track of the current date which can change when warping long distances. The game also introduced the concept of a regenerating shield mechanic.
