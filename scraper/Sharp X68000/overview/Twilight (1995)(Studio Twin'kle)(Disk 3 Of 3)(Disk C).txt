In Twilight, the protagonist, who works for a mysterious magic-using organization, is set to Transylvania, to investigate the murder of a nun known as Sister Christa. A woman named Karen, who also specializes in black arts, goes to the monastery with the hero, but obviously has her own agenda. The goal is to find out the truth by questioning the suspects, keeping an eye on one's own safety...  In the beginning of the game, the player can choose any of the six possible scenarios, each dedicated to a different suspect (all female). They all take place in the same monastery, but dialogues, events, etc., are completely different. The interaction in Twilight is confined to periodical decision-making; many of the decisions are "wrong", leading to the hero's death or otherwise premature ending.  Twilight is set in a dark, "gothic" world of a Transylvanian monastery. The game uses photo-realistic background images, with the traditional bright anime graphics for characters. The game features explicit sex scenes.
