Pro Tennis: World Court (プロテニスワールドコート Puro Tenisu: Wārudo Kōto?) is a tennis sports arcade game that was released by Namco in 1988 only in Japan; it runs upon Namco System 1 hardware, and was inspired by the 1987 Famicom game Family Tennis. In August 1988, the game was ported to the PC Engine console, in which a new tennis-based role-playing quest mode was added, and was later ported to the North American TurboGrafx-16 console by NEC under the title of World Court Tennis in 1989 and a sequel named Super World Court was released in 1992, which ran on Namco NA-1 hardware and allowed up to four players to play simultaneously.
