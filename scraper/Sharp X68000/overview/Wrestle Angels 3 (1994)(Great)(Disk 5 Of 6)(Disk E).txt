Wrestle Angels 3 is, like its predecessors in the series, a turn-based wrestling-themed game. The player takes the role of the manager of a new company that represents and trains young wrestlers, guiding them to participate in an all-female league. Wrestlers can be selected and hired either directly by following the league's records, or by scouting the city and recruiting suitable candidates. Afterwards the wrestlers can be trained by choosing and investing points into particular moves. It is also possible to send them on vacations. Most actions in that preparation mode cost action points (AP); running out of them ends the turn.  The manager can then send the wrestlers to participate in tournaments. The actual wrestling matches can be set in auto, with their outcome determined by the wrestlers' parameters. However, it is also possible to control them manually, choosing each move from a deck of randomly dealt cards. Moves include attacks, special attacks of various kinds, charging, healing, etc.   There is also an exhibition mode where the player can select any of the 48 available wrestlers and take them to single or tag-team matches.
