The stage of events is once again a boarding house in the country, this time in the winter season, with skiing and other attractions. Gen is having a good time with the young, but "demanding" Reiko Honda, when the news strike: a family friend, a young foreigner named Eddie, is stabbed by an unknown assailant.

With the help of the many pretty girls at the boarding house and its surroundings, Gen begins the investigation, determined to find the criminal...    Hoshi no Suna Monogatari 2 plays almost identically to the  first game, the only interface-related difference being the addition of a mouse. Otherwise, the player follows the same procedure: look at everything; talk to everyone; find the items needed to advance the investigation; ask the right person the right question, and show the right item to the right person - all done by selecting commands and topics from the extensive verb menu.
