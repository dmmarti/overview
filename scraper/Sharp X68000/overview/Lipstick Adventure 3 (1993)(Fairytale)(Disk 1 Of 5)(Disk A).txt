This entry in the  Lipstick Adventure series continues the story of the young private detective Gorou and his sweetheart Otomi. After attending a friend's marriage ceremony, they return to Gorou's office and find a strange package in the flowers. The package contains pictures of Otomi and several other girls, her schoolmates, some of them naked. Gorou heads to Otomi's high school to begin the investigation, without realizing that he will soon become involved in a sinister conspiracy...    Lipstick Adventure 3 plays similarly to its predecessors, having typical Japanese adventure gameplay with menu-based verb commands. The interface has been slightly tweaked, allowing easier "triggering" of events by eliminating some unnecessary commands.    Like the previous games in the series, Lipstick Adventure 3 walks a fine line between adult and non-adult games, having graphical nudity and plenty of sexual innuendo, but no explicit sex scenes.
