In Pac-Land, our friend Pac-Man is facing more daring adventures than ever before! In his new contest, Pac-Man comes face-to-face with ghosts on their own turf. In this 2D platforming adventure, his quiet day at home is disturbed by those nasty specters. A fairy princess has been kidnapped, and Pac-Man must leap over rivers, avoid dangerous water spouts, fly in magic shoes, dodge the Hoppers from the bushes, skip past the skulls aiming to drag you to Sand Prison -- all in the aims of reaching Monster Mansion and rescuing the princess to restore peace in Pac-Land!
