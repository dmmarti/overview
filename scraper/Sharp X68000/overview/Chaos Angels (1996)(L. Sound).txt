One day, a lone traveler came from the desert to a small camp. There, he sat down, weary from his long travel, enjoying a short rest. "Have you heard of the Tower of Ouroboros"? - asked him a bearded old man who was sitting nearby. - "A legend says that if fulfills all your wishes. Many heroes tried their luck there. None has returned. Dangers lure at every corner in the tower, deadly enchantresses who will bring demise on anyone daring to set his foot there". Without answering, the young traveler left the camp, and soon he was standing at the tower gate...  Chaos Angels is a semi-erotic RPG similar to the first two Dragon Knight games. The entire game is viewed from first-person perspective. You gradually explore the huge 3D dungeon, the Tower of Ouroboros, fighting enemies and gaining experience points. The combat engine differs from most other Japanese-style RPGs: for attacking, instead of choosing an appropriate command from a menu, you hit the enemy by moving towards it. You can also sometimes see the enemies approaching and turn to different sides during battle. Like in Dragon Knight games, the enemies are mostly sexy girls wearing revealing clothes or simply naked.
