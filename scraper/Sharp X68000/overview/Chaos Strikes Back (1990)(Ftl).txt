Chaos Strikes Back is an expansion and sequel to Dungeon Master, the earlier 3D real-time action role-playing video game. Chaos Strikes Back was released in 1989 and is also available on several platforms (including Atari ST, Amiga, X68000, PC-98, FM Towns and PC). It uses the same engine as Dungeon Master, with new graphics and a new, far more challenging, dungeon.
