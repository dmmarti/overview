Bell's Avenue is a collection of three very short games, all of which play like minimalist Japanese-style adventures and have stories that revolve around sex. The interaction follows the standard verb-command "Look-Talk-Think" template, without any sub-menus that would allow interaction with different objects.   The Lyrical Story After Rain, the shortest of the three, is an episode from the life of a lonely teenage girl, who meets another young girl on the train and later has erotic fantasies involving her.  Paragon Wing Bird is considerably longer and has a sci-fi theme, the protagonist being a male adventurer from the Earth, who has encountered a race of human-like creatures in deep space and is interested in their sexual traditions.  Kara is the longest of the three, is set in a high school, and describes a group of young girls who are eager to have their first sexual experience. This game allows menu-based navigation through various locations in the school and non-linear story progression, which can change depending on the player's choice and order of locations to visit.  Bell's Avenue also contains Under Deep, a very short futuristic story, basically consisting of two bizarre sex scenes and having no interaction at all, and Minimum Hour, which presents, in a comical way, a few ideas for sex-based arcade games, which are not playable.
