SCRAP! is a game for the iPhone, following the general tradition of building-block type games where you complete lines in exchange for points. The twist that makes SCRAP! interesting is that the orientation you must complete lines in, switches at random and is highlighted along one side of the game board. In lieu of gravity, you have a given amount of time (dependent on your current level/difficulty) to place the piece before it is moved to the SCRAP! pile. Pieces can be retrieved from the SCRAP! pile (limit one per turn) and placed on the game board. Don't let the pile build up too much, or your game will come to an end.
