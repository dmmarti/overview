The year is 1944, and the landings in Normandy have begun, turning the tide of World War II. A German pilot named Michael Ilgner accidentally steers his plane into a mysterious vortex during the battle. He is then transported to the magical parallel world of Quintia, where he is requested by humans and other peaceful races to use the powers of his aircraft to defeat horrifying monsters that were unleashed upon the world.  Quintia Road is an anime-style fantasy adventure game. The gameplay is quite straightforward, requiring minimal input from the player and offering no puzzles or other challenges. The player is normally expected to repeatedly select various verb commands (such as "Look", "Talk", etc.) from a text menu. There are no objects lists to combine these commands with. Story advancement is linear and only a few instances offer traveling choices.   There are a few scripted turn-based battles in the game, which allow the player to select various types of attacks; however, these battles evolve in a prescribed fashion and the player's choices have little to no impact on the results. The game contains scenes with nudity and explicit sexual situations.
