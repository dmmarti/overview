Dragon is an action-puzzle game with an Oriental theme, based on the Ballistic concept. A dragon, made of a chain of colored marbles is moving along a curved track towards a temple. You must shoot colored marbles from your cannon at the bottom of the screen (which can move left and right) to prevent the dragon from reaching the temple (if it does, you lose a life); when you shoot a marble into the dragon, it becomes a part of it (replacing the marble that was there before), and if at least three same-colored marbles are next to each other, they disappear, possibly also causing neighboring marble groups to vanish. As you keep destroying the marbles, a bar at the top of the screen slowly fills itself; once it is filled completely, the level is finished.     Power-ups, coins and bonuses fall occasionally from the destroyed marbles. Coins give you additional lives when you collect enough. Power-ups have a lot of various effects - slowing the dragon down, allowing you to shoot a destructive lightning beam, and more. Bonuses simply give you score.     By achieving some difficult feats (like completing several levels without losing a life) you earn trophies which you can later view in your trophy room.
