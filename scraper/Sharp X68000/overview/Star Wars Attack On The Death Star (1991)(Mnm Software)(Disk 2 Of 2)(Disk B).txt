Star Wars: Attack on the Death Star recreates the final battle from the "Star Wars" movie, putting the player at the controls of an X-Wing starfighter. The gameplay is similar to the popular 1983 arcade game: the first stage is a dogfight with TIE Fighters as you approach the station, second one makes you skim Death Star's surface while dodging turbolaser towers, the last one is the torpedo run down the trench.  The game features digitized voices (straight from the film) and 3D wireframe vector graphics - this makes the Death Star analysis sequence during the intro look nearly identical to original animation (created with analog computers) used in the movie (shown in the Rebel base briefing room).
