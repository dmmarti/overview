You are Sid Chip and you are trapped in The Great Allonso's nightmare consisting of 20 circus rings full of platforms and creatures with the screen scrolling left or right when you move. You have to find the exit of each ring by using the various platforms and avoid the creatures that inhabit the nightmare. The various platforms consist of different shapes as well as disappearing and appearing ones and the exit has to be found before your energy counts down to zero. If you touch any creature then you lose one of five lives and the current ring has to be restarted. There is an extra life awarded for every five rings completed and the joystick is used to control Sid.
