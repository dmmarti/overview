The sequel to Bokosuka Wars, featuring all-new enemy characters, items and traps, as well as a more balanced level of difficulty. Gameplay-wise, it's mostly identical to the first game - you must walk 600 meters to reach the enemy castle and kill the Dragonet. The player controls three units: the King, Knight, and Pawn. When moving these units, you can either move your entire army at the same time, or move all of one type of unit. Only your own units can initiate battles. All units gain strength while fighting and after fighting a sufficient number of battles, Pawns and Knights will be promoted to stronger, golden forms of themselves. There are captive Pawns along the way that can be rescued to increase your ranks, but only Knights can break the gates in front of them. There's also barriers every 100 meters, which can only be broken by King Suren. The King is also the only one who can destroy large trees in some of the forest areas.
