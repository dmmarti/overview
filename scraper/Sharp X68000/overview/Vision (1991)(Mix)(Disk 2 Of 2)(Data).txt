The year is 2044 and after the events in Vision, the Rockfellow Tower, a self-contained generation ship for the exploration of deep space, starts off into the unknown universe. But as they enter the tail of a comet and bring the ship up to light speed, the crew realizes that there is something or someone else on the ship who doesn't want the crew to succeed on their mission.    The basic game is an adventure in which you see the world through the eyes of the protagonist. You move from screen to screen to find items, talk to the crew in a multiple choice dialogue and solve puzzles to find and eliminate the evil. Always with you is the computer MAX that controls the whole ship. As you move through the Tower he maps all the different levels and also helps you with the riddles and keeps you on the right track. To spice things up a bit, the game also features some action-based mini-games.
