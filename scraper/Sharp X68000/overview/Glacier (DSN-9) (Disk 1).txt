In Glacier you control a heavily armed sports-car (the "iceblade"), and your goal is to drive down the so-called "Mountain of Death" without wrecking your car.  Opponents will make this goal pretty hard (they use rockets, machine guns, mines, and more), but there are also the chasing Mounties (driving in 4WD-Grummers), helicopters, impressive cliffs and even enormous rocks that can fall on your roof.
