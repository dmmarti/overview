The second game in the  Can Can Bunny series follows the story of a young Japanese boy named Takeshi. One fine night he looks out of the window and notices a sexy girl undressing in the opposite building. "Oh, if only I could get her", sighs Takeshi. Immediately, the kind bunny-eared fairy Ariko from the Magic Land appears and... grants Takeshi's wish! He now possesses a Magic Book that will teach him ho to conquer the hearts of pretty girls... and not just the hearts!  Compared to the first game, Can Can Bunny Superior plays more like a stereotypical Japanese adventure, without the complications of buying items and alike, and with simpler menu commands like "Look", "Move", etc. In the beginning of the game, the player can choose between different initial statistics for Takeshi, which will influence the difficulty of conquering a particular girl. The game itself is divided into three separate scenarios, with up to four different girls in each (the scenarios begin in a shopping mall, aboard a plane, and in an amusement park), but the goal is always the same: talk to the girl in such a way that she will become yours.
