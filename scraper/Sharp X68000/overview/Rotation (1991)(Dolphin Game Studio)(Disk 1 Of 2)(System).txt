Rotation is a puzzle game where the player is shown a large disc, composed of little balls arranged hexagonally, which he must rotate by parts until it is identical to the little example disc, at which point the next level begins. Clicking one of the balls rotates the six balls around it counter-clockwise. In every level the player has 50 moves to get the disc into the right layout. If the player fails to rotate the disc so that it is identical to the little example disc with 50 moves, it is game over.
