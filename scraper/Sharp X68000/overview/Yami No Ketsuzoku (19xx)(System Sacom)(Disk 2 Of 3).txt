Miyu Izawa is a designer working for the prosperous Studio Yo in central Tokyo. She is nicknamed "famous detective" because of her unusually sharp perception: since her childhood, she has possessed an inexplicable "sixth sense" that warns her of danger by coloring her vision red. When her former classmate and successful model Marie is brutally murdered, Miyu decides to use her special senses and investigate the mysterious circumstances of her death.  The sixth installment in System Sacom's Novel Ware series, Yami no Ketsuzoku is a Japanese-style adventure game. The player interacts with the environment by selecting objects to look at, conversation topics, and locations to travel to from a menu. There are no puzzles or inventory items to use. The game features extended text descriptions, cutscenes, and dialogues which sometimes prompt the player to make choices for the heroine.
