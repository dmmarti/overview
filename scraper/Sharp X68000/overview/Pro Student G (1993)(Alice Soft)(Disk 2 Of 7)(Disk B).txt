By the end of the 20th century, radical educational reforms have transformed the Japanese society. Students were split into opposing groups, and the more aggressive of those eventually formed a dominant organization named Order of Black Phoenix, centered on the cult of a mysterious person known as "The Queen". Outcast students have escaped to a secluded island near Okinawa. A wandering lazy and lecherous manga and anime fan named Gor? End? teams up with a female teacher and a few students to lead an opposition force against the oppressive governing circles.    Pro Student G is a Japanese-style erotic comedy adventure. The player guides Gor? through a series of locations and encounters, selecting choices from a menu to trigger the next event and advance the story. Some choices have a traditional verb-object structure, while others incorporate context-specific actions, many of which are included for humorous effect.
