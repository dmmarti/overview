Nostalgia 1907 is a visual novel that takes place in the year 1907 on board the ship "Nostalgia". While the ship was crossing the Atlantic ocean, an explosion damaged it. Taking the role of several characters, among them the ship's captain and a few passengers, the player has to find out who caused the explosion and why.    The game is mostly composed of text accompanying still pictures; the interaction is restricted to several occasions during which the player has to make choices for the character currently regarded as protagonist. The game's graphics are done entirely in sepia tones. Despite its Japanese origin, the hand-drawn graphics of Nostalgia 1907 eschew the usual manga-style aesthetics.
