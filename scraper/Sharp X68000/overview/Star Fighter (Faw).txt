Star Fighter is a rather generic side-scrolling shoot'em'up with certain Scramble influences. Your plane travels across an undulating landscape where aliens sit at the ground. You can strafe down and shoot them on the ground, or wait until they lift off and fly into your line of sight. Your beam is short and thin, so precision is required in order to hit them before they fly into you. The game starts off in four-colour mode, then switches to black and white high resolution mode, possibly to simulate night flight. Three game speeds are available, and the screen scrolls fast, even at the slowest setting. Unlike the vast majority of games, it scrolls from left to right, instead of the opposite. Due to the use of analogue joysticks, and the speed of your ship, there is a lot of inertia in your control, which feels more realistic than the straight course in which you travel in other similar games.
