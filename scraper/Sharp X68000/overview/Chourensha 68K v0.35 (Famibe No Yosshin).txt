Cho Ren Sha 68k (Ultra Fire 68K) is a top-down vertically scrolling DÃ… jinshi shoot 'em up. It was originally released in 1995 and later it was ported to PC. It is a shooter with classic mechanics modeled after the Toaplan games. There is one ship and it can be moved around freely. Shooting needs to be done manually as there is no autofire. Points are earned by killing enemies, completing levels and collecting items. It has seven stages with up to eight loops and a final boss after a few. Red power-up ships that are shot leave behind one of three items: a weapon upgrade, a bomb that clears the entire screen and a one-hit shield that also explodes when it disappears.
