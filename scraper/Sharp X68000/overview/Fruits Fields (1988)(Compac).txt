Fruits Fields is a single-player, shareware, Soko-Ban type of puzzle game from Hong-Kong.  The shareware game has fifty levels, the full game has one hundred levels. In each level the object is to guide Nic around the game area and collect fruit. In the way are crates which will only move in the direction of the arrow they carry. Some crates can be destroyed by pushing them into a wall or, in certain circumstances, another crate. Points are scored for each piece of fruit collected and for each crate destroyed but one point is deducted for each square moved. The level is complete when the last piece of fruit has been collected, not when all crates have been destroyed. For each level completed the player exposes a segment of a pretty picture.  The game has a high score table, music, sound effects and can be played by the mouse or the keyboard in a window or full-screen
