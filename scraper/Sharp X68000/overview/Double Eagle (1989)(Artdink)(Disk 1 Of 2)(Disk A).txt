Double Eagle is a golf simulation game. The tagline "2way Golf Simulation" refers to the two game modes to choose from.  GOLFLIFE is career simulation. The player's character starts out 20 years and 1 month old and with 100 yen, and has 30 in-game years to win tournaments, move up the Japan and World rankings and advance up the classes (Amateur class, Professional Class B, Professional Class A and Professional Class S) before retiring at age 50. There are four stats: physical, mental, technic (technique) and fatigue that affect your performance. To start out you need buy or rent a club at the golf shop. Extra money can be earned by doing one of the three side jobs. At first there is light work, hard labour and caddie, moving up the classes lesson, TV booking and commercial become available. Each job pays differently as well as affect your stats, most notably increases fatigue. To get rid of fatigue you can rest at home, hot springs or hospital. There's also three training options: gym increases the physical stat, image increase mental stat and course allows to practice on courses, thus gain technic. Each action advance the time by one month.  The game features 40 tournaments, either two-day or three-day with all participants playing 18 holes each day. Some tournaments also require a qualifying round for the main competition. On the course you're joined by 2 or 3 AI players.    PLAYGOLF allows 1-4 players (human and/or AI) to play an 18 hole round. There are 12 courses to select from as well as different seasons/conditions - spring, summer, autumn, winter and snow.   When on the golf course the action is viewed from a top-down perspective, players can choose the club they want to use, direction of the shot, how the golf ball curves (fade/draw) as well as adjust the shot power and accuracy by stopping a moving bar at the right time. Wind direction and power must also be considered as you play your shot.
