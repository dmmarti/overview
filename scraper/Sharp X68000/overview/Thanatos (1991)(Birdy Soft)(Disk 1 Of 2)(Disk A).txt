In this magical kingdom you take control of a dragon, "Thanatos the Destroyer", whose eternal destiny lies in conflict with the forces of the underworld. The dragon which is very large and superbly animated, flies, walks, swims and burns it's way through the landscape. It must collect beautiful young enchantresses, "Eros", who then rides on its neck and guides it through the castles, to collect the book of spells and find the magic cauldron. On their way they have to fight fierce knights armed with lances and foot-soldiers with long-bows, as well as a variety of weird mythological creatures. The game features fantastic landscapes with a totally new panoramic scrolling action.
