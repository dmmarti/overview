Battle Game is a game on the marapets.com website where the player's Marapets creature can engage in battle to earn Baspinar Points, used as a currency. In order to play, an account needs to be registered at the site and a pet must be chosen. Next it needs to be trained to gain health, strength, speed, defense and magic. In order to be able to battle with a pet, players need to place trading cards in their deck. Players face the enemy on the trading card that is added to the deck.    Battles are fought automatically based on the different statistics, somewhat similar to My Brute, but without the fight visualized. The Baspinar Points provided as a reward will match the health of the enemy that is fought.
