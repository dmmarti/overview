Break Down is a variant of the "concentration" memory game. The player is presented with a screen covered by face-down cards, and has to click on them one at a time, matching two identically-looking ones to make them disappear. Each wrong move removes a life from the player character. Cards that can be matched are portraits of young women; other cards include Life Up (grants an additional life), Death (instant loss of life), and Shuffle (re-arranges all the cards). The player must complete a set amount of correct match-ups in a round before running out of lives. Doing that leads to a picture of a young girl who gradually undresses as the player wins more rounds. It is possible to play against four girls to view different pictures, but the gameplay and the cards are identical for all of them.
