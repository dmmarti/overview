Flip-Flop is a strategical puzzle game with the aim to open all windows on the building's wall at each of three stages. The wall contains 4x4 windows, and by turns the player clicks on one window to toggle its state. But the other windows in the same row and in the same column will be toggled, too. After passing the first stage, the player is lifted up to the second stage, where one of the windows toggles its state randomly. Third stage is almost like the second, but more difficult to pass. The player has 99 turns on each stage before the game's session is over. More points are given to the player with a lesser quantity of turns made to open all windows on the stage. Although this puzzle has an analytical solution, the trick of the game is introduced on its 2nd and 3rd stages, and player should be quick to provide this solution taking into account a slightly dynamical influence on the given puzzle. The global goal is to beat the highest score.
