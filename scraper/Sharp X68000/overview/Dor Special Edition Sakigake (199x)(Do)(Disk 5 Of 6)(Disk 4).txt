DOR Special Edition: Sakigake is the fourth entry in the  DOR series. Unlike all the previous games, it contains only one scenario instead of the usual three.  The scenario follows the story of Kensuke Funaki, a young boy who attends a prestigious private high school, where the students specialize in sports as well as various theatrical activities. The biggest event of the school is an all-female wrestling competition. Kensuke finds himself in a promising situation: in order to secure his support, the young and pretty competitors are willing to go far - very, very far...  The gameplay in DOR Special Edition: Sakigake is  the same as in the previous entries. At every screen, the player reads a bulk of text (descriptions and dialogue), after which a menu with a few (usually three) selectable actions/responses pops out. It is often needed to go through the choices several times before the next event is triggered, and the player is taken to another screen.
