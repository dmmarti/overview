Thrice is a puzzle game similar to Columns. You drop blocks consisting of fruit symbols (such as pear, watermelon, plum, etc.) and must match three or more either horizontally, vertically, or diagonally. Unlike in Columns though, here you can't rotate the blocks normally; you must find where you would want a block to fall and once it touches a block, you can press right or left to make the column fall over.
