Typically for the genre, the player advances the story by repeatedly selecting verb commands ("Examine", "Talk", etc.) from a menu. Most of the time the player is free to move between various locations (also menu-wise) to explore the game world, talk to characters, and solve the mystery. The game has scenes with nudity and sexual content.
