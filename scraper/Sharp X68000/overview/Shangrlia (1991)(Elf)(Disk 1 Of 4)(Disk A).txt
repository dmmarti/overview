Tooru has always been a rather ordinary young man living in modern-day Japan. One day he was taking a stroll with his girlfriend and the two followed a strange cat to a mysterious castle. There, they met an old man who said he was Fermata, the court magician of the Kingdom of Nyuckel located in a parallel dimension where magic dominates over technology. A great war is taking place there. Erion, prince of Nyuckel, was cursed, and his soul transmigrated into Tooru's body. Taking the role of the prince, Tooru must command ten female officers and their armies and repel the invaders.  Shangrlia (sic) is a turn-based tactical game. The ten female commanders reside in the castle and can be approached in any order. Each of them transfers the player to a different location (alternating between urban, dungeon-like, and rural areas) where a tactical battle takes place. Every commander is responsible for a unit type in the army. These types include Lancers, Fighters, Swordsmen, Cannoneers, Horsemen, Archers, Mages, Ninjas, Dragon Riders, and Birds. Enemy forces possess the same unit types. Each type has advantages and disadvantages in terms of power, mobility, range, etc. The goal is to select and position units on the battle field, taking the conditions of the terrain, number of enemies, distance, etc. into consideration. Defending own castle and capturing that of the enemy is the top priority.  The battles then proceed in a turn-based fashion. Some unit types can attack from a distance, while others are restricted to fighting on adjacent squares. Battles are displayed as animated sequences on a separate screen, their outcome calculated according to the unit's properties and parameters.   After each round of victory, the female general removes an item of her clothing. The final result for each general is an erotic picture with partial nudity and implicit sexual scene, but no explicit images.
