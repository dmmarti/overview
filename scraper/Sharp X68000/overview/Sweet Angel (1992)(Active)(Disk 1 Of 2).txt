The player takes the role of Seisa, a bald-headed photographer. He likes sneaking into a high school and taking pictures of pretty girls. But one day he was caught and beaten by a girl who didn't want to be photographed. So Seisa plotted an elaborate revenge scheme: he managed to learn a spell that allowed him to look like different girls. Naturally, being one of the girls, it becomes much easier for our heroes to earn their trust - and to seduce them!  Sweet Angel differs from the majority of Japanese adventures by allowing the player to physically move in the game world (from top-down perspective). Most important conversations and seduction scenes are still viewed from the traditional first-person perspective, with menu choices for different actions.
