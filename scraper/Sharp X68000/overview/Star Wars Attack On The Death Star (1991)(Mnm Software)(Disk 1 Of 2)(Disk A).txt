Star Wars: Attack on the Death Star recreates the final battle from "Star Wars", putting the player at the controls of an X-Wing starfighter in full 3D. Engage in dogfights with TIE Fighters as you approach the station, and skim Death Star's surface while dodging turbolaser towers and shoot the torpedo run down the trench.
