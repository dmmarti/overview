A young woman named Ryouko is working in a research laboratory specializing in communication with aquatic animals. Recently she has made groundbreaking discoveries with one of the test subjects, a whale named Gigi. Ryouko managed to establish full communication with the animal and teach him information. However, other people involved in the project have their own ideas concerning the practical usage of the whale's intelligence, and are ready to use it to further their own shady agendas.  My Eyes! plays similarly to visual novels, albeit with many more choices and interaction than it is usually the case with games of its type. There are no permanent menus and only a few instances where navigation is possible; however, the player is often presented with several context-specific commands and choices in each situation. Often it is necessary to go through commands multiple times to trigger the next events; sometimes wrong choices lead to Game Over.
