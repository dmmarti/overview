Soft de Hard na Monogatari is the third entry in System Sacom's Novel Ware series. The story has humorous overtones and deals with production of computer games. The protagonist is the son of a software company manager and has to fill in as a temporary leader when his father falls sick and is hospitalized. Himself an avid gamer, the young boss has to use his employee's strengths and his own imagination to produce a successful game such as the "Nobara Series" DAME (an obvious parody of DOME).  Gameplay-wise, the game abandons the adventure format with its set verb-object commands and interaction with the environment, and plays more like a visual novel with light simulation elements. The player has to make choices for the protagonist, which will advance in-game time and ultimately influence the outcome of the story. It is possible to talk to the employees, check out planned software releases, and make other decisions crucial for the company and the hero's success.
