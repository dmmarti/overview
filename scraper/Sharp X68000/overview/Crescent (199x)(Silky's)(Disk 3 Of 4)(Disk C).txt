Crescent is divided into four unrelated stories, which can be accessed directly from the main menu in any order. The first story is set in a fantasy scenario with a protagonist who tries to defeat a sexy female magician and her equally sexy female demonic minions; the second story involves a visit to a female detective, which evolves into an erotic encounter and unexpected violence; the third story is a visit to girls' locker room in a school; finally, the fourth story features an Asian-style mansion inhabited by pretty young women.   All the four stories are heavy on explicit sexual content and are almost entirely dedicated to erotic scenes. The gameplay is confined to repeatedly selecting context-specific options (sometimes up to six) until the next event is triggered. Story progression is linear, but a few times wrong choices can lead to Game Over.
