Darius is a shoot 'em up arcade game released by Taito in February 1987, although its title screen indicates a 1986 copyright. It is the first game in the Darius series, known for using a unique three-screen arcade cabinet setup, non-linear level design and multiple endings. 

In August 2016 the original arcade version was re-released for PlayStation 4 in Japan and other Asian PS-Stores. The port was made by Hamster Corporation and is part of the Arcade Archives on PlayStation 4. Darius R, a remake of the first Darius game with some different tunes and a fewer number of stages, was released for the Game Boy Advance in 2002. While never originally ported to the Sega Genesis, a port of the game by M2 is featured on the Sega Genesis Mini microconsole.
