Parodius, or Parodius Da! is a horizontal scrolling shoot-em-up video game. It is a parody of Gradius and other shooting games. The Great Octopus threatens Earth. To help Parodius save the planet, the player and his friends must begin their search around the world to find and destroy the enemy. Parodius allows players to choose a character from four different ones. In addition, it retains the selectable weapon system of "Gradius"; a "Power Meter" at the bottom of the screen allows players to purchase weapons and upgrades using capsules left by some destroyed enemies.
