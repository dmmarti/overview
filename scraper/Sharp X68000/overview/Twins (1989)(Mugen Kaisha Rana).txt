Two twin brothers, Na Daero and Na Gaeseong, get caught by the police for committing minor crimes. Once released from the prison, the twins begin to plan a more serious theft, hoping for an easy way to wealth and prosperity. However, they are overheard by a mysterious Mr. X, who foils their schemes and departs with their trophies. As the twins try to catch Mr. X, the police is hunting them down, and no one knows how the chase will end.   Twins is a Korean-made game that is primarily composed of puzzle adventure segments similar to those of Gobliiins. The player must alternate between the two brothers and use their unique abilities to bypass obstacles and solve puzzles in an enclosed area typically consisting of a few screens. Daero can move heavy objects and use various tools, while Gaeseong is able to jump and is a skillful pickpocket. The game also contains some fighting sequences in which the brothers attempt to take on Mr. X in simple one-screen brawls, and driving sequences where they must escape a police pursuit.
