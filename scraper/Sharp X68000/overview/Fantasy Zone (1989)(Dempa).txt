Watch out! They may look cute and innocent, but they're Menons, nasty aliens that have overrun the eight planets that make up Fantasy Zone. Your job is to clear each world of Menons. Every time you zap one, it turns into a coin. Collect enough coins and you can buy power-up items like deadlier weapons and mightier engines. At the end of every planet lurks a super-powerful boss.
