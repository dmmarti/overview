Fly! is a flight simulator released for both the Macintosh and Windows platforms, and simulates civilian airplanes and helicopters. New plane models and custom scenery can be added. Multiplayer is supported through the internet, with text chat or voice chat. Five main scenery areas are supplied: Chicago, New York, San Francisco, Los Angeles and Dallas/Fort Worth. Flight briefing and flight planning are included and can use many of the supplied navaids. The following planes are included: Cessna 172, Piper Malibu, Piper Navajo Chieftain, Beech King Air B200, Hawker 800XP. Aircraft systems are accurately simulated, and require proper sequence of actions to, for instance start the engine. The 288 page manual covers all aspects of flying such as aerodynamic forces, navigation, weather and aircraft control.
