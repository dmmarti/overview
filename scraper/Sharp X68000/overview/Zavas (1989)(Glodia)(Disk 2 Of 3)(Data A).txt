Described by its developers as a "New Type Role-Playing Game", Zavas differs from the Japanese-made RPGs by resembling a Western-style RPG, in particular the  Ultima games of its time. Retaining the characteristically Japanese manga/anime aesthetics in graphics, Zavas has little resemblance to Japanese RPGs in other aspects. It is not story- and character-driven; the player controls a knight named Mardy in the medieval fantasy land of Fargana (with slight Middle Eastern influences), and is free to go anywhere, exploring the world without following a set storyline. The top-down world consists of vast wilderness areas and towns.   Similarity to Western RPGs is evident in detailed management of player-controlled party (NPCs with names and portraits, but little personality can be found and recruited). beside the usual weapon, armor, and item management, the player must also buy food to keep his characters alive. Some of the interaction with NPCs offers choices (for example, paying money or attacking a guard who demands toll to enter a city). The enemies appear randomly. The turn-based combat is very similar to that of Ultima games, with characters freely moving around a fixed battle screen.
