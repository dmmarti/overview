Slime Master is a very simple doujin (independent freeware) role-playing game. The player character is sent by a seductive princess to bring back an amulet that was stolen from her. The protagonist then enters a first-person dungeon, which is absolutely linear, consisting of a single corridor navigated by selecting "advance" or "retreat" from a text menu. Enemies looking like cute little girls dressed in warrior and monster costumes would pop out, resulting in simple turn-based battles where the player can choose to attack or use a scroll. Scrolls pop out at certain spots in the dungeon as well or are won by defeating enemies, and include offensive magic and a cure spell. Experience points are awarded for vanquishing enemies, and the player character levels up.   After retrieving the amulet the protagonist returns to the princess, who then takes off her underwear in front of him as a token of gratitude. However, the amulet is immediately stolen once again, and the player has to repeat the same process two more times, fighting identically-looking enemies who nevertheless become stronger, and receiving similar erotic awards for these endeavors.
