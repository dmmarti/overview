The player must take control of Grobda, a tank trapped in an arena filled with numerous indestructible obstacles and several enemy tanks. When an enemy tank is killed, it will cause an explosion, and any other enemies that happen to be in the blast radius at the time will also suffer the same fate. But if Grobda is too close to the explosion, it will also be killed. Grobda has a shield that offers very temporary protection from enemy fire, but this will soon disappear if it is constantly under attack or shot. Each round is called a "battling", and there are a total of ninety-nine in the game.
