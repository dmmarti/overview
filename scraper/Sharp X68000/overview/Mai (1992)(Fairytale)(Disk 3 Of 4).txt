Mai is a little girl with cat ears who studies the art of magic. Unfortunately, she doesn't always do her homework, and sometimes loses control of her magical powers. This is precisely what happened one day, when she accidentally unleashed a magical spell upon terrified classmates. Now the poor girl is being hunted down by male and female students, teachers, and other people, and she has to fight for her life while perfecting her magic-casting skills.  Mai is similar to the better-known Mad? Monogatari games in many ways: it is a solo pseudo-3D first-person dungeon crawl; it casts a little innocent girl with magical powers as the heroine; it displays no numeric statistics (damage feedback, the heroine's progress, etc. are shown only graphically or with the help of text messages); it has an overall "cute" theme with comical animations. However, unlike Mad? Monogatari, Mai contains graphical nudity and scenes with mild depiction of sexual situations.
