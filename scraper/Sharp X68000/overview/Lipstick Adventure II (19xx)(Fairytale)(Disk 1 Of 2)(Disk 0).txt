This is the second entry in  Lipstick Adventure series. Once again, the protagonist is the young private detective Gorou. One day his girlfriend Otomi introduces to him a customer, a man who calls himself Sakamoto. When Gorou meets him at the train station, Sakamoto hands him a suitcase, saying he should deliver it to his company in Osaka. However, the suitcase contains a bomb, and the poor Gorou is brought to police headquarters as a terrorist suspect...    Like the first game, Lipstick Adventure 2 is a detective/mystery Japanese-style adventure with comical and erotic elements. The player typically advances in the game by going through all the menu commands at a given screen. The commands are of a traditional "Look - Talk - Think - Move" variety, with sub-menus for object names.
