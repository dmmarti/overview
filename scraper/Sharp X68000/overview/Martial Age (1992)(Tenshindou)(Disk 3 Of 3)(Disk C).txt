Masahito is a Japanese teenager who studies martial arts. However, instead of studying, he prefers to chase pretty girls. Finally, after a quarrel with his father, Masahito leaves his home. Accidentally, he bumps into Keiko Yashima, the principal of Yuai girls school. She tests Masahito in combat, and against all rules, accepts him as the only male student in the school. Naturally, our hero uses this opportunity to "get lucky" with his all-female school mates...  Martial Age is a Japanese-style adventure game. Most of the time here is spent depleting menu commands ("Look", "Talk", "Think", etc.) in every given location, exploring the school and getting acquainted with the girls. There is also turn-based combat in the game, but no statistics of any kind. The battles work like mini-games, which require the player to guess the "weak spots" of the girls, after which they give up and the hero can initiate a sexual scene.
