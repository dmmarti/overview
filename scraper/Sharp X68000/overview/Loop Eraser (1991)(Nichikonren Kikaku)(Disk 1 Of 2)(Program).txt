Loop Eraser is a puzzle game consisting of 120 stages. Each stage is a screen containing puzzle pieces arranged in different patterns on a screen. Each piece has a line drawn on it, and can be rotated left and right to change its direction. A line that faces downward but is not connected to another one will automatically fall down until it becomes adjacent to another line. The goal is to connect lines together under correct angles to build "loops", i.e. complete forms out of straight lines that encircle an area of the screen. A loop disappears once formed. A stage is solved when all the lines have been arranged into loops and are therefore removed completely from the screen.
