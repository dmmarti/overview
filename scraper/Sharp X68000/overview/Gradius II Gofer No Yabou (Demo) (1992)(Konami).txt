The player finds himself once again in the role of the pilot of the spaceship Vic Viper to face the empire bacterion, newly led by Gofer. Gradius II has a gameplay similar to the original game, but incorporating improvements drawn from the spin-off Salamander like the two selectable weapon configurations. It is also the first game in the series to integrate the "boss rush", a level including only confrontations against the boss.
