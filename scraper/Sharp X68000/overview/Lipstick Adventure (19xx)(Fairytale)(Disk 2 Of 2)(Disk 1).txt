In Lipstick Adventure, the player takes the role of Gorou, a young Japanese private detective. One day, a wealthy and powerful old man contacts him and asks him to find a box which - according to him - contained a family treasure. The young detective thinks that fortune has finally smiled to him, but when his pretty girlfriend Otomi disappears, he realizes that the mystery is bigger than he thought...    The game is a traditional Japanese adventure, with the usual first-person view and "Look - Talk - Think - Move" interface. There are no puzzles, and the game usually advances the plot when all the commands at a given screen are depleted, sometimes requiring to visit different locations several times.
