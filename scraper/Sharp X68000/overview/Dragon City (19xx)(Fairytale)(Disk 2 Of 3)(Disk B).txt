Dragon City is a monster breeding game originally dedicated as a Facebook application game.   The player takes on the role of a dragon breeder. Monsters in this game wholly consists of dragons, which are hatched from eggs or breed between two different types of dragons. Dragons produce gold in their habitats, which will allow the player to purchase adjacent land, build more habitats to acquire more dragons, purchase food, and various other activities, all of which for the single purpose to help the dragons under the player's care grow larger and stronger. Speeding up activities or purchasing special items/dragons will require gems, which may be purchased with real currency. Dragons may also optionally be sent for player vs. player (PvP) combat.  Hatching Dragons  There are 12 different dragon elements, all of which may require specified habitats for them to live in. A flame dragon for example will require a flame habitat before an egg or dragon is purchased. Initially, the player acquires dragons by purchasing an egg and hatching it at the hatchery. Depending on the type of egg, hatching will require a specified of time for incubation. The hatched dragon may then be placed at a specified habitat, where the dragon will steadily produce gold for the player. Dragons will grow bigger when given a specified amount of food. The larger the dragon, the more gold it produces for the player.  Breeding Dragons  When the player possesses two types of dragons, preferably from two different elements, the player may opt to send those two dragons to the breeding mountain to mate. Dragons of two different elements will produce a new type of dragon. Mating will require an amount of time. This new dragon may be sent to live in either habitat of its parents. For example, a flame dragon and an terra dragon will produce a volcano dragon. This volcano dragon may live in either a flame or terra habitat.
