For a while peace was reigning in the magical Kingdom of Hyunckel. However, dark forces have emerged again. Commanding hellish creatures, they managed to capture the top female generals of the Hyunckel army, sealing them in special devices resembling eggs. Only three generals remained free, and they must liberate their companions and re-capture the land.  Shangrlia 2 is a turn-based tactical game and a sequel to Shangrlia. The goal of the game is to capture castles occupied by the enemy, freeing commanders on the way. Unlike in the first game, the player is no longer allowed to choose any battle right from the beginning and is at first restricted to only three battles. Same applies to characters and unit types: in the beginning the player can only control three types of fighters, and other characters are unlocked gradually.  There are fifteen unit types altogether (as opposed to ten in the previous game). New units include different types of horsemen, chariots, winged horses, golem commanders, etc. In addition, each unit comes in three variations, e.g. catapults and cannons are considered the same type, variants of which can be unlocked by completing battles and freeing them. Each unit gradually advances in strength, and must reach a "master" level to be actively selected by the player and positioned on the battle. This time, enemy units are mostly completely different and mainly consist of various monster types such as skeletons, minotaurs, dragons, undead mages, assorted hell creatures etc.  Winning battles gradually unlocks erotic pictures of the female generals. The sexual content is noticeably heavier than in the first game and includes non-traditional types of sex as well.
