Six-Gun Shootout is a turn-based strategy game of man-to-man combat, using the setting of the American West in the 19th century. It offers ten scenarios which can be played against the computer or a human opponent. The scenarios are loosely based on historical situations, like the Gunfight at the O.K. Corral, or entirely fictional. Some are based on movies, for example the 1959 released "Rio Bravo".
