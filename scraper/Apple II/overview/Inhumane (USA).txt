Awakening in an abandoned archaeological desert dig site, the player of this rudimentary, sophomoric satirical text adventure (derived from Infocom's Infidel) is brought up to speed through plot-advancing notes kindly left behind by Francisco Roboff (on loan from the Mask of the Sun), a "friend" who returned to civilization with all the treasures he'd surreptitiously excavated from the pyramid dig site save one, the golden coffin he couldn't find -- and left his old pal behind to unearth.  After some cursory to-ing and fro-ing, the player accesses the subterranean vaults of the buried pyramid, discovering no fewer than nine different deathtraps and a peculiar motivation to experience them all first-hand.  Should the player succeed, in this self-effacing goal, boundless treasure awaits in the form of the golden coffin... as well as a somewhat inscrutable joke about the author's high school geometry class.
