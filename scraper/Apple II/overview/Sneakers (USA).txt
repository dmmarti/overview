Sneakers is a variation on Atari's classic  Space Invaders. Move your ship to the left and to the right and shoot enemies who try to fall down and kill you. There are eight types of enemies, each one using a different tactic to destroy you. You start with the relatively harmless Sneakers and gradually work your way through Cyclops, Saucers, Fangs, H-Wings, Meteors, Scrambles, and Scrubs. After you finish off the Scrubs, you proceed to level 2, which follows the same pattern, but with an increased difficulty level.
