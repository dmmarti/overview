Can you out run and out shoot the dragon's henchmen? Watch out for the wrath of the dragon if you do.  Borg is a slightly more complex version of Stern's Berzerk arcade game. The player navigates a number of one-screen mazes, attempting to shoot all enemies while avoiding enemy fire and touching the walls. If it takes too long, the evil Grud will yell, "BORG!" and chief dragon Borg will come out, yell "RUN!", and hunt and kill the player, just like Evil Otto in Berzerk.
