Tharolian Tunnels is an action game that contains five parts with varying gameplay. The player's task is to enter the planet Tharolia through a tunnel and reach the centre of it where its defense systems has to be destroyed. On the way to the centre the player has to avoid getting killed by the defenses and avoid crashing into the tunnel walls or running out of fuel.  The game starts out in space with the first part being a shoot 'em up similar to Space Invaders where the player has to clear out two rows of enemy ships that move back and forth across the screen. Once it has been completed the player enters the planet and has to navigate a space craft through a small tunnel that scrolls from top to bottom while not crashing. It's possible to use guns to destroy walls but it will lead to fuel being depleted. In the third part the tunnels widens but here there are torpedoes launched from above and fighters that have to be either blasted or avoided. It is followed by an automatic sequence where the ship is refuelled. The final part of the game involves navigating through lasers and land into a docking compartment. Here thrust controls are used and it's necessary to land with minimum speed to avoid crashing.
