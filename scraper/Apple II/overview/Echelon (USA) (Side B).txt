Take a bit of Wing Commander, and mix some of the fanciful parts of modern aircraft sims and you'll have an idea of what this game is like. Echelon puts the player in combat over vast landscapes and around cities as a member of an elite fighting force facing down an invasion. Battle takes place in a variety of aircraft with futuristic abilities using a variety of weapons. There is a branching campaign of around 50 missions, and over the course of play you can advance from Lieutenant to Commander and have greater control over how each mission plays out.
