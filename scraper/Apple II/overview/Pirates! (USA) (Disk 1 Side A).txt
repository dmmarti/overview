You are a Space Pirate and you have planned to board 21 cargo ships to steal precious substances. Each attempt on a cargo ship is split into three stages and each must be completed to move on to the next stage. Once the you have finished with a cargo ship, you move to the next one. Before the game starts you can select from three crafts to pilot. Stage One: This a a top down shooter with the screen scrolling constantly. At first you scroll vertically up the screen before the game changes to scrolling diagonally right, then left and back to scrolling upwards at various speeds. You must shoot with your gun or avoid various crafts and objects, and if you touch one you lose one of five lives. Occasionally a star will scroll past and if collected will replenish your ammo which you have a limited amount. Collect three stars and you move on to Stage Two. Stage Two. You must keep blasting the cargo ship viewed from above on a single screen. As you keep blasting the ship you must avoid the ships bullets which follow you around the screen. Blast the ship enough times and you move on to Stage Three. Stage Three: You have now boarded the cargo ship and you must walk around exploring it looking for disks which contain a code to put into a computer to open doors. You must avoid or shoot the guards and if you touch the sides you lose a life and you move on to Stage One for the next ship. The stage is flick-screen viewed from above.
