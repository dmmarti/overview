Six different track and field disciplines are recreated in this multi-event sports simulation. Up to six human players can take them on.You can replay each attempt, or watch simulated recording of the world record distances and speeds of the day, for training purposes.  100m sprint and 110m hurdles have a similar joystick waggling technique, but time the jumps over the hurdles accurately. The long jump is also waggling-based, with the joystick being pushed up to launch the jump and ensure a correct landing.   In diving you can choose the jump to attempt, with more difficult ones worth more points if you get it right. In archery you shoot at four circles of differing distances several times, aiming to get as close to the centre as possible. This is done by holding down fire to prepare the arrow, and push down to release the bow. Weightlifting involves the snatch and clean-and-jerk phases, with the latter involving more joystick presses to keep the weights under control.
