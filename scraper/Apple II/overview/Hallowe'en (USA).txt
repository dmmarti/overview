Halloween is a first-person shooter with a Halloween theme. The gameplay is a bit different from other 3D shooters as it involves a time limit. The game world is set in a medieval setting - so you get maces, bow+arrow, etc. Many Halloween monsters will stand in your way, including spiders, mummies and giant bats. More than 10 levels are to complete.
