This is a fantasy text based adventure game which also has pictures of most of the locations. It contains about 100 locations and 80 illustrations.   The Ring of Chaos has enslaved the noble sorceress, Lisa, and all space-time is threatened by its destructive influence. As bearer of the Ring of Order, your mission is to free Lisa before reality is disrupted beyond retrieval.  Ring Quest is the nominal sequel of The Quest. Ring Quest returns you to the magical land of Balema, accompanied once more by Gorn, your water-swilling strong-arm. Far to the north is your ultimate goal, the sorceress's mountain citadel. As though its shield of green lightning were not adequate, you soon encounter other obstacles, including trolls, manticores, amorous ogresses, and greedy seers.  Good mapping is amply rewarded in this adventure, where Lisa is liable to pop in at any moment to cast a teleport spell, bewitch Gorn into confusion, which can be hard to detect, or dry up your water supply.
