The year is 2082, and post-World War III atomic radiation has reduced the world's population to less than 10,000. You've been captured by corrupt land barons, and must escape their robot-protected castle. You hop into a turbo-car, and must navigate the 2 miles of twisting concrete jungle that surrounds the castle in every direction. Hiding out are robotic Death Squad cars armed with laserquark cannons, which will attempt to hunt down the player, and destroy them. The robotic lasers are so powerful, they can slice through solid walls to destroy the player.
