Track Attack is a futuristic 3D racing game in the style of Hi-Octane. The player races through futuristic cities and tunnels trying to beat their opponents. This game also features damage, and some special upgrades. Perhaps the most innovative feature is the Dynamic Track System, which allows the 39 circuits to change during the race. There are arrows the player can drive over which make the track behind them change for their opponent (obstacles popping up for example), therefore making it harder for a driver to catch up.
