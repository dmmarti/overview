Tanktics is a game in which you are required to design and create tanks which can then be used to defend your base. To carry this assignment out you must gather resources which can then be dropped into a crazy machine called the Part-o-Matic. This machine also acts as your base. This game seems to be aimed at more casual or younger gamers, as the graphics are very simple and, when complete, you can give your tanks just two commands: move and shoot.
