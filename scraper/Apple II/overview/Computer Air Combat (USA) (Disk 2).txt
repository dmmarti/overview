Computer Air Combat is a simulation of aerial warfare during World War II. Players can choose from flying American, British, German or Japanese aircraft in a variety of different air combat missions. The game is played in a series of turns until all aircraft on one side are destroyed or the engagement is terminated by mutual agreement. Players take turns during the movement phase and then in the combat phase. During each turn you can check the status report and position report. Position reports display position and speed of friendly aircraft and all visible enemy aircraft. Status reports are for checking damage to aircraft and ammunition supplies. Final results of each game are displayed after all the enemies have been destroyed or you quit the game.
