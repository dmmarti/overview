Depth Charge is a single screen game where you must protect five battleships that sail on the top of the screen from an attack by enemy submarines below the waves. Each battleship is on screen on it's own and you move it either left or right, while the various numbers of submarines move left or right across the screen at different depths. The submarines will release various mines which head to the surface but you are armed with five depthcharges which move down the screen trying to hit the submarines or mines. If you hit a submarine, mine or the depthcharge hits the bottom of the screen then you are re-armed with another one. If you are hit by a mine then that ship is lost and the next ship appears. Before you start the game you can select your skill level 91-4) with one being the easiest.
