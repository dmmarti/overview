An early Risk clone for the home computer.  Players compete for 42 numbered territories on an Earth map.  Reinforcement armies are awarded every turn based on the number of territories and continents controlled.  Following the  reinforcement phase, players have the option to attack an enemy territory.  Simulated dice rolls (not shown on screen) determine the outcome of the attack.  The player's turn ends with the movement phase, in which armies can be moved into old territories or newly conquered ones.  There is no AI opponent, but the game supports up to 9 different human players.
