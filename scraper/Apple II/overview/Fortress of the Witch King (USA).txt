Fortress of the Witch King blends strategy and role-playing. The basic premise is to build up an army to assault the Witch King's Fortress (think Mordor). Encounters are played out in text, but there is a map screen which gives an overview of the landscape. One must raise enough gold to hire wizards, warriors, scouts, clerics and raiders by defeating bands of roaming monsters and minions. In addition, a number of artifacts and special items must be found before entering the fortress. Up to four players compete in hot-seat play.
