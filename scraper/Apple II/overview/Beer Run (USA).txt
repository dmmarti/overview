Beer Run is a platform game where the player has to catch Artesians. It is a tie-in with the beer company Olympia and the Artesians are creatures from their commercials of the time. The game starts out at the bottom of the Sirius building and the player has to make his way upwards by climbing ladders or taking the elevators that sometimes appear. Upon reaching the top of the building a blimp will take the player to another building, the Olympia brewery. Along the way, hostile creatures such as the green guzzlers and bouncers has to be avoided or else the player will fall down and lose a life. Points can be earned by catching falling beer cans that are thrown by the Artesians. More beer is earned by picking up kegs or by riding elevators.
