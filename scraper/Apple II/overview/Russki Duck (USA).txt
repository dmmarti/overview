Russki Duck is an espionage game. The CIA building is the starting point and the single screen city is where you have to search for top-secret plans which have been hidden in, of all things, a rubber ducky. Who would ever suspect a rubber ducky after all? The player must navigate the city and it's stores to find this rubber ducky while avoiding the enemy spies while in the stores. You can find objects which you can use, otherwise you need to bring things you find back to the laser-protected room in the CIA building.
