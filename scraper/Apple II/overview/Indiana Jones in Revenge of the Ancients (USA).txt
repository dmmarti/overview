Indiana Jones in Revenge of the Ancients is a text adventure game. Hack your way through the steaming, tangled Mexican jungle. Fight off the onrush of vertigo as you grope through the treacherous, tunnel maze in the treasure-laden Tepotzteco Pyramid. Tighten your grip as you dangle from the wing of an airborne World War I DeHavilland. Whatever it takes, Indiana Jones must stop the cruel Nazi, Plebinheim, and his SS thugs from unleashing the power of the Mazatec Power Key against the world. Vicious bats, venomous snakes, marauding bandits - even for the daring Indiana Jones, this is going to be tough!
