Omega is usually considered the first roguelike game (CRPG dungeon crawls with top-down or isometric graphics and a high degree of randomization; Rogue and NetHack are examples) with a traditional plot.  In it, you play a person from Earth that has been transported to another world by the Omega Project (this part of the plot is explained in the intro).  You are trying to become an Adept, a person of immense power who follows the Buddhism-like principles of the Lords of Omega, by undergoing a series of quests.
