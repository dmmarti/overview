Beast War is for 1-4 players, however you always play against the computer. You direct the movement of six different semi-intelligent beasts on a circular, 43 space field; Just like the Star Wars chess scene on the Millenium Falcon. In each round of a battle, your goal is to max your score by destroying opposing beasts and capturing squares.     Each beast has its own movement pattern, energy level, strength, and unique advantage over one other beast. (Dracon can burn the winged Aeroctus to cinders but fears the bite of the Saurus.)  Any move consumes energy, so it is a resource you need to manage closely. Combats are shown in a small action sequence where each beast may advance, strike, or retreat.
