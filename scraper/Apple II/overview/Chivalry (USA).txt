Chivalry is a medieval-themed computer board game where players must rescue the King from the dreaded Black Knight.  The game is set up as a standard board game for up to four players.  Each player must take turns and roll the dice or spin the wheel to move the player in that set number of spaces.    There are 35 spaces with over 40 challenges in total where each player must take part in a arcade-style mini-game challenge or make a decision based on the choices given.  The tasks range from catching flour bags in a cart, finding the secret to evading a troll, or choosing the correct door to enter from a Wizard.  Players are also given the option to take the high road or the low road in their travels, which also determines the challenges found.  Depending on when players land on a space, random elements can affect the outcome, some helpful, others harmful.  Winning the challenge determines whether the player will proceed further along the board.  Losing a challenge can set a player back or lose a turn.  The game is won when the player successfully beats the Black Knight by climbing the tower and saving the King.
