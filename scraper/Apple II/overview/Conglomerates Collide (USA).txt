Conglomerates Collide is a game of multinational corporation management. Or basically, a monopoly sim. You take the role a high-ranking executive in charge of company acquisitions and your objective is to acquire the most companies in the market in order to propel you to the role of chairman of the board and defeat the opposing corporations.  You start the game with a base capital of 20 million dollars and through each turn you must decide whether to swallow companies or not depending on their current worth, which is determined by the ever changing market conditions. The trick is that you are not alone in the game as other corporations are on the hunt to acquire successful companies and it's your job to grow enough each year/turn so that you can take the poor workers away from the other corporations and ingest them into your own money-making monsters instead of the other way around. Remember! This is a game of multinational conglomerates so the bigger and badder the better.  Features 3 modes of play: single player, vs computer and vs human opponents (up to 4-players hot-seat). Uses a simple text-based interface with small still graphics to commemorate events such as acquisitions and such.
