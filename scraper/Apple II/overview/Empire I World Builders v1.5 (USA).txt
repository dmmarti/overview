The gateway to the New York Rocket Field is your first step of a space voyage in which you may choose one of three career paths to follow, here at the dawn of the interstellar Empire.  Homesteaders must find a hospital planet on which to farm, raise a family and conquer the environment.  Miners must find a high-density planet in a search for material wealth.  Missionaries seek out populated planets to preach to the masses.  Each path into the space frontier has its dangers, and a misstep may have bloody consequences.
