While trying to sneak across the border to Rungistan you were caught and thrown in jail. You must use all the tools available to you to escape and make the long and perilous journey back across the border.  Escape From Rungistan depicts your adventures in black and white line graphics and short text descriptions. The RETURN key toggles you back and forth between text and graphics. Despite its general adventure game feel, some puzzles occur in real time and there are some short arcade-like sequences such as when you have to ski down a hill avoiding the trees in your path.
