You are in command of Space Station Zulu and its 43 man crew orbiting a huge gaseous giant in a farflung corner of the galaxy. Shortly after an exploration ship leaves the station the onboard computer notifies you that the sanctity of the station has been violated by unknown alien lifeforms ( which find your crew very tasty). Now you must direct your crew in a desperate struggle against this deadly peril. There is only one way to win and that is to rid Space Station Zulu of all the alien intruders. The aliens win by taking over the ship. There are 3 levels of difficulty (normal, difficult, and little hope) and this is a one player versus the computer game.
