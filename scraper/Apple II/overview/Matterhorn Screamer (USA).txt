A side-scrolling, jumping game in which you help Goofy climb the treacherous slopes of the Matterhorn.  Using keyboard or joystick, make Goofy climb ropes or jump to ledges, empty bobsleds or gondolas.  Jump over goats or snowmen before they push Goofy off the ledge.  At higher levels of difficulty, watch out for falling icicles or loose ledges. To win the game, collect all the flags along the way and claim the Mickey flag at the summit.
