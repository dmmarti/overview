Fooblitzky was Infocom's attempt at changing their image in three ways: by making a graphic and multiplayer strategy game.  The concept was kind of a scavenger hunt, where players would run around town, spend money, collect clues, and deduce what the four objects were to win the game. It used many off-computer components, including folding maps/notebooks.
