Based on the 1982 Midway arcade game based off the Disney film, players take control of TRON in four different game grid scenarios: Light Cycles: race TRON's blue Light Cycle against one or more enemy Cycles in an attempt to have them crash and de-rez against their own light walls.  I/O Tower: blast through numerous Grid Bugs in an attempt to get into the I/O Tower.  MCP Cone: blast through the defensive walls of the MCP in order to get into its central cone.  Battle Tanks: maneuver TRON's tank against one or more enemy tanks (or Recognizers) to be the last one standing. The Xbox Live version offers competitive or co-op play to go for the highest score, and a mode that features enhanced graphics.
