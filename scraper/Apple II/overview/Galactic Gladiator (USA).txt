Early tactical combat game about humans and aliens duking it out with laser guns, melee weapons and special powers. Campy alien races included Viking warriors with horns, Denebian slime devils and space mutants with a killer touch. Much of the game would be spent watching the blinking words, "PLAYER TWO IS PLANNING HOW TO DEFEAT YOU".
