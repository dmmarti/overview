Fastgammon is a computer adaptation of the board game Backgammon. The game follows the rules of the board game as can be expected with one player competing against an AI opponent, both attempting to move all their pieces of the board. It's entirely played with keyboard and to do a move the player simply enters the number of the starting point followed with the number of the destination. To move a piece of the bar the player enters B followed by the number of the destination point. To bear off a piece the player enters the number of the point followed by an H. Dice rolls are done automatically by the program (except for the Atari version where it's possible to turn on manual input of dice values). When starting a new game it's possible to reuse the dice rolls from the previous game.
