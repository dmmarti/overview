Lemonade Stand is a simulation game where players take charge of their own lemonade business in the fictional town of Lemonsville.  Before the start of each business day, players are given the day's weather forecast: Sunny, cloudy or hot and dry.  After receiving the weather report, players take charge of three factors that will affect business for the day: The number of glasses of lemonade to make, the number of advertising signs, and the cost of lemonade per glass.  Depending on how the prices are set during the day's weather conditions, players will either make a profit or lose money until the next day.  Lemonade stand is a single-player game or can be played with up to 30 players alternating turns.
