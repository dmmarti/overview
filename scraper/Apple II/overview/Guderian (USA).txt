Guderian simulates the critical campaign near Smolensk on the road to Moscow during WWII. As the German player you are at the head of the panzergruppe invading central Russia and must master blitzkrieg tactics to encircle and overrun Soviet divisions and drive deep enough into Russia to make the capture of Moscow possible. The Soviet player must work to counter the German threat and make attacks that will cut off the supply of the German forward units. The game can be played solitaire as either side.
