This is a version of the classic Sokoban, written in FORTH for the VG5000 home computer. Your job, as a smiley face with sunglasses, is to push all the shopping carts to the parking position. But it's easy to get stuck since you have to shuffle the carts around or you can't move freely, and carts in a corner can't be pulled out. All the graphics are in character intervals, making the playfield a rather small part of the screen. The game also includes a level editor.
