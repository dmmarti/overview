Fighter Command is a strategy game depicting the clash between the British RAF and German Luftwaffe during the 1940 Battle of Britain. The player is put in command of either air force: Germans need to strike British airbases, radar stations, and industrial centers in order to cripple their aircraft assets, while the Allies will try to defend themselves by wiping out the incoming Germans from the sky before they can reach the intended targets.
