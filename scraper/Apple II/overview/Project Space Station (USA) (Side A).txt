Project: Space Station casts the player into the role of a NASA Administrator, charged with the task of designing and building a space station. The project will span 15 years, during which time the player must plan shuttle launches, recruit personnel, manage the budget, conduct research and development and, of course, design and build the station. A very deep and involved game for such an early effort.
