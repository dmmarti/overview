Cricketeer is a Frogger variant where the player takes control of a cricket that like in the arcade original first has to cross a heavily trafficked street and then a river before jumping into one of five home boxes on the far end of the river. Unlike the arcade game the street and river sections take place on separate screens.  A level is completed when all five home boxes are occupied by crickets and the game then moves on to a higher level. Lives are lost after being hit by a vehicle or jumping into the river and when they are all gone the game is over.
