Experience the thrills of space flight with this realistic space flight simulation.  You pilot the Lunar Excursion Module (LEM), a sophisticated cargo vehicle that shuttles astronauts and equipment to and from the moon.  Colorful graphics and real-life controls make every flight an adventure.  Land on the foreboding lunar surface or rocket from Tranquility Base into moon orbit.  Tranquility Base portrays space flight and lunar landings with true-to-life accuracy.  The laws of motion and gravitation affect the LEM spacecraft much like they influence an actual spacecraft in outer space.  Using keyboard or joystick controls, you can increase or decrease engine thrust, change the pitch -90 to +90 degrees, and roll from -10 to +10 degrees, refuel your spacecraft, and start the engines.
