This short text adventure casts the player as the sole survivor of a space disaster involving the luxury liner "Adonis."  Stranded on a hostile planet full of monsters after a lifepod landing, the player must reach the planet's only other human occupants and find a way home.  The game features a simple two-word parser, lots of "instant death" locations (making mapping important) and relatively few puzzles.
