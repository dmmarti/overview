High-resolution graphics remake of the text-based adventure game inspired by the cult-classic British television show about a former spy who is abducted and sent to a resort-themed "prison" where his captors attempt to get him to reveal why he resigned from his classified job. The game takes place on "The Island," where the player travels from building to building, each hosting a metaphorical quest in which the player's creative thinking skills are tested. Players demonstrating individual thinking eventually gain access to the Island's "Caretaker," and their ensuing conversation (using a language parser) can lead to the player's freedom.
