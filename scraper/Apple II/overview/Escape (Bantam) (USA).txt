Escape is a RPG-like labyrinth game for medium resolution coded in assembler.   Your mission is to find the exit of the maze. On your way to the exit you will encounter many obstacles, like bombs, magic traps, teleporters, locked doors and an infinite supply of monsters. Many things in the maze will also aid you in your quest such as bandages, first aid kits, potions, scrolls, money, weapons, rings, belts, wands, and armor. Your inventory may contain up to eight items.   When you start the game you have no health points so it is very easy to get killed right in the beginning. Your maximum health will increase every time you kill a monster.
