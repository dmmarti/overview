Your ship has photon torpedoes and a warp drive, it "beams" stuff up and down, it's shaped like a saucer with two protruding nacelles... yeah, you guessed it - it's another space combat/strategy game which has nothing to do with Star Trek at all!  Rather, it takes place in the solar system, which is on the verge of being conquered by the forces of Titan.  The oily Saturnian moon is home to an evil expansionist regime, which has already annexed a few planetary bodies, and is hellbent on capturing them all.  The remaining free worlds have chosen you to lead the resistance.  Your task - defend friendly planets and moons, crush the Titan fleets and retake the lost colonies.  You may travel freely throughout the continuous game world, and between its planets and moons, each of which is a potential ally or foe.  Everything is carried out in real time; a radar screen, a map and a planetary info sheet help keep track of the proceedings. Even the positions of planets and moons are continuously updated as they creep along on their orbits.  Conquest is accomplished by transporting armies from friendly locations down to enemy worlds; you'll have to take into account planetary defenses, refuel and repair at friendly bases as needed, and directly engage hostile spacecraft using your shields, torpedoes and tracking missiles. Meanwhile, enemy forces will attempt conquests of their own, and your presence will often be required for defense.  Should your ship be lost in battle, it will respawn at the nearest friendly planet, but any personnel it might have carried is lost forever.  For each new game, you may choose to use the same solar system from your previous session, or start with a new randomized configuration.
