Based loosely on the famed Greek character, Crypt of Medea is one of the earliest horror-themed games released for the Apple II series. The plot is simple: you are trapped in an underground crypt filled with a variety of ghastly creatures and traps, and you must find your way out before you become just another nameless corpse--just like the ones you encounter all throughout the maze-like mausoleum.  Crypt of Medea is a Hi-Res adventure game with color graphics, using the simple two-word "verb noun" parser that was common in these types of games. In its heyday, it was panned for its graphic depictions of gratuitous violence, but seeing as such material has almost become a standard in today's games, one could argue that Crypt of Medea was fairly ahead of its time.
