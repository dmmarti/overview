Crosscountry USA is an educational game for ages 10 and up, and the first in the Crosscountry series created by David Vincent. The player drives a 18-wheel truck picking up commodities across the United States of America and delivering them to their destination. Along the way, players learn geography skills, and the relationships between time, distance and money. The game responds to the player?s typed-in commands and includes a printed map of the United States of America.
