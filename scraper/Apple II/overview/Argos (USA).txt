Argos is a shoot 'em up game made up of three stages, each with different gameplay. The player's task is to defend Earth from the alien race Znark who are leaving their doomed home planet Argos. In the first round the Argonians attack Earth's defense satellite from a base on Saturn. The player has to launch missiles from the satellite (which is located in the top left corner of the screen) and destroy all aliens as they swirl around the screen.    In the second round the task is to defend the last surviving city on earth which is being attacked by jet bombers. The player attacks them with two anti-jet guns on the ground and has to kill them off before the city's protecting force field is destroyed. In the third round the Argonians attack the city streets with missiles, bombs, spaceships and parachuters. The player controls a tank left and right and has to shoot missiles at the enemies.
