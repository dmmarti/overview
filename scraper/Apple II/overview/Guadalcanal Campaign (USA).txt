Guadalcanal Campaign is a turn-based wargame simulating the 1942 Battle of Guadalcanal during the Second World War. It lets the player command American land, sea, and air forces between August 7 and December 31, pitting them against the Japanese (controlled by second player or the computer). Alternatively, a short campaign (October 1 - December 31) and short scenarios (Coral Sea, Eastern Solomons, Santa Cruz) are also available.   Each game turn represents 12 hours (the full campaign lasting 147 days, 2 turns per day). A game turn consists of reinforcing your troops, moving task forces (numerous ships are included, from destroyers to aircraft carriers) and troops into position, launching air missions and patrols (each side has one fighter type and four bomber types, plus recon floatplanes) and combat resolution. The map is a 40x40 grid stretching from Truk to northern Australia shore, with key ports and airbases. Victory points are computed at the end of each game.
