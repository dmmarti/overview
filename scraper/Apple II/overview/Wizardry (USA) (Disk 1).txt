Wizardry: Proving Grounds of the Mad Overlord is the first game in the Wizardry series of role-playing video games. The game was one of the first Dungeons &amp; Dragons-style role-playing games to be written for computer play, and the first such game to offer color graphics.It was also the first true party-based role-playing video game.    After equipping the characters with basic armor and weaponry, the party then descends into the dungeon below Trebor's castle. This consists of a maze of ten levels, each progressively more challenging than the last. Classes have multiple spells, each with seven levels, that characters learn as they advance.
