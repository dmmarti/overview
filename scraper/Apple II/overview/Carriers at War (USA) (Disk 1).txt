Carriers at War is a remake of the original for the Apple II and Commodore 64. The game is a strategic war simulation (wargame) in which the player takes on the role of a task force commander in control of Fleet Carrier Air/Naval Operations in the Pacific from 1941-1945. The player can reenact six crucial carrier battles from that era including Pearl Harbor, Coral Sea, Midway, Eastern Solomons, Santa Cruz and the Great Marianas Turkey Shoot.  The game features completely new graphics including a menu overhaul to make more use of a windowed interface. Most important in the graphic overhaul is that combat is now presented in animated graphics.  Gameplay has also changed with new features including fire damage on ships, which can be repaired, but can also easily spread to do more harm (and this too is graphically represented). More airplanes can be commanded and now individually inspected instead of in squadrons. The AI has also been refined to play more like a human player with imperfect information available to it.
