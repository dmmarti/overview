 Vampire Chronicle For Matching Service is a 2D beat' em up game from Capcom in the same style as the classic Street Fighter series.  It uses the CPS-2 system (the same as Street Fighter Alpha series, which makes gameplay of these two titles very similar).  Vampire Chronicle is, in fact, a collection of all 18 characters and 4 different play modes available in the whole Vampire (Darkstalkers) series.  The originality of this game lies on the possibility of controlling monsters and supernatural creatures, such as vampires, werewolves, demons, zombies and mummies, instead of regular boxers or kung-fu and karate fighters.
