 The sequel to the arcade and Dreamcast title SEGA Bass Fishing, this game features deep-sea fishing where you can catch must more than just bass. The game offers 15 types of fish, 5 different locales, and 16 types of lures with many more unlockable. By catching fish, you earn item cards with equipment, boats, accessories, fish and artifacts for an aquarium.  There is also a network feature where you can log on to SEGA's Marine Fishing webpage to compete in fishing competitions. Play in arcade mode, free fishing mode or the more involved original mode (which features several mini-games), and view your rewards in aquarium mode. The original mode was not included in the arcade version, and the mini-games train different techniques (luring, casting, fighting...)
