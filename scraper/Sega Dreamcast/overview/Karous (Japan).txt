 In this unique vertically-scrolling shooter you take the role of a mysterious girl named Karous, who commands a tiny fighter ship and attempts to destroy an evil armada bent on world domination.  The game plays as your average vertical-scrolling shooter, in which you must clear several stages by destroying all incoming enemies and surviving their onslaught. A unique addition to Karous, is that you don't collect weapons by power-ups, but instead upgrade each of your basic weapons (gun, sword and shield) depending on their use thanks to a basic experience module, with increased power and features at later levels (multiple shots, bullet reflection, etc.)  The game uses cel-shaded polygonal graphics with a distinct black and white look.
