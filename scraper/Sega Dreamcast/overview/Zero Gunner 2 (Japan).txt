 Zero Gunner 2 would on first inspection appear to be a bog-standard 2D shooter. However this import game actually has a bit of a unique "spin" on the shooter genre.  Most noticable, all backdrops and vehicles in this game are modelled in 3D. The textures are quite highly detailed and this adds more depth than standard 2D shooters. Secondly, since your craft is a helicopter, a unique "target and spin" feature has been added whereby you can both rotate your craft to better attack an enemy or alternatively to lock on a particular point in space and rotate around it while still firing. This is all controlled by the player however and is not automatic; to succeed mastering this feature is imperative.  The usual power-ups and bosses are included, along with a selection of helicopters to select from.
