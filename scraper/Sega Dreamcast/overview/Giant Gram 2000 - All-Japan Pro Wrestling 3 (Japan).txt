 Giant Gram 2000: All Japan Pro Wrestling 3 was made by the Sega/WOW developing house in Japan. This title features wrestlers from the All Japan promotion, and also a wide variety of legendary figures. The legends in this game include favorites from both Japan and the U.S., for example: Rikidozan, Bruno Sammartino, and Bruiser Brody are all playable. Only a few wrestlers featured in this game still remain with the All Japan promotion. Giant Gram 2000 really focuses on the sport aspect of professional wrestling. All of the western stuff you would expect to find in a wrestling game, such as: Steel chairs, steel cages, ladders, tables, and all other unnecessary weapons are left out of this release. The game also features an overhauled “burning” fan system. This system let’s the player build up a meter on-screen, that fills up according to all of the reversals and other moves he or she is performing on an opponent. Once the meter is filled the player then enters a “Burning Rage” which allows for the he or she to initiate devastating combos and other moves to defeat opponents.
