 Surf Rocket Racers is a jet-ski racing game for the Dreamcast.  As in most aquatic racers, success here depends on your ability to smoothly handle unpredictable waves and aggressive competition at the same time.  There are several game modes to choose from.  First up is the Championship.  In this mode, you compete in a series of circuit races and accumulate points based on your finishing position.  The racer with the most points at the end of the season wins.  The other modes include a trick competition, a hazard and obstacle course, and a head-to-head 2-player mode.
