 The official name for the game is ''Giant Gram: All Japan Pro Wrestling 2 in Nippon Budokan''. This is the long awaited sequel for ''All Japan Pro Wrestling featuring Virtua'' that hit the Sega Saturn back in 1996. This game is on the Sega Dreamcast this time around; it was converted from the arcade version, which is only in Japan, for the Dreamcast. The arcade version is running on the Naomi chipset. Since the Dreamcast console is based on this chipset, this enables for an excellent conversion for a home system. The game runs at 60FPS on the Dreamcast. The graphics are silky smooth with no slowdown whatsoever. The game is playable with the Dreamcast arcade joystick if you are looking for a real arcade feel to the game.
