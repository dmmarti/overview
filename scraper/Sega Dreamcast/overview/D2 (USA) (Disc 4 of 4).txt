 Canada, Christmas 2000 ... In the skies over Canada, Laura´s plane has been hijacked by terrorists. The plane is filled with screams, shouts and fear as the hijackers terrorize the passengers and crew. In one of the seats a black robed magician gazes into a crystal, chanting the phrase "Shadow, the final destroyer". Mysterious indeed. Laura´s compact begins to glow. A vision of a meteorite hurtling towards the Earth is reflected in the mirror. Suddenly the plane is struck by the same meteorite that appeared in the vision, and falls towards the frozen tundra below.  In the middle of a raging blizzard, Laura opens her eyes to find herself inside a mountain cabin. She was saved by Kimberly, one of the passengers of the wrecked plane. 10 days have passed since the crash but Laura can remember nothing, not even her name. The door of the cabin opens and one of the terrorists enters. While Kimberly and Laura stare in horror, he transforms into a hideous monster. He is not the only one. Other crash survivors and locals have mutated into terrifying monstrosities and attacked people. Is there anyway to survive this living nightmare? At present it is shrouded in mystery.  D2 combines classical survival horror exploration and first person combat with a RPG typical experience/level system. You play the mysterious heroine Laura, stranded in a vast snowy landscape after a plane crash and struck with amnesia about the last 10 days.  The 3d engine allows you to freely move around the world, pilot snow mobiles, hunt for food or even capture photos. You will meet a variety of people and have to fight gruesome creatures and dangerous monsters. As the story advances you slowly regain your memory and unfold a terrifying plot about the end of the world.
