 After an object from outerspace hits Dinosaur Island and surrounds it in a protective cocoon, you are left stranded to uncover the secret that could end life on Earth as we know it.   You play sea rescue expert Eliot Ballade, or weapons specialist Dogs Bower. Explore the island, solve puzzles and avoid hazards in seven areas and 230 locations. You can swim, drive, climb and fight, hand-to-hand or with the arsenal at hand.
