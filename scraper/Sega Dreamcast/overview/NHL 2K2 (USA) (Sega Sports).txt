 NHL 2K2 is the sequel to NHL 2K and the last game in the series to appear on the Dreamcast. It is very similar to its predecessor, reusing the same graphics engine and many of the modes. There have been improvements in graphics with higher polygon counts, more animations and 60 fps frame rate. AI has also been improved, and the controls allow for many more realistic moves. Player and team stats have been updated for the 2001-2002 NHL season.  Game modes include Exhibition, Season (now optionally only of half length), Playoffs and, newly added, Tournaments. Players can be created and traded and rosters edited. Coaching controls allow setting of strategies and lines. The game includes a basic control mode that uses the face buttons for all actions, and an advanced mode that uses the trigger buttons to modify the actions of the face buttons, allowing for a higher variety of moves. The game includes play-by-play commentary by L.A. Kings announcer Bob Miller.
