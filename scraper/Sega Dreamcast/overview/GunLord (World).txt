 After the space pilot Vanessa Gaiden defeated the Evil Empire in the events of the game Last Hope, she got missing on her way back and wasn't heard of anymore. Vanessa's husband, Gordian Gaiden, sets out to search for her. Meanwhile, a new evil has appeared in the galaxy: a planet lord called "The Master", who can create and control evil beings made of steel, and uses his power to terrorize the galaxy. On his search, Gordian comes across the evil presence of The Master and sets out in his Gunlord suit for the planet Kairos II. Gunlord is a mixture of platforming and run and gun gameplay in the spirit of Turrican. This includes exploring large and highly branched levels in search for items, bonus, power-ups and the exit. The game mechanics are very similar, with an assortment of weapons, which can be upgraded by finding power-ups, but only being able to have one main weapon. Gordian is also able to form a ball to move through narrow passages or attack. Additional weapons are a limited amount of smart bombs (huge energy swipes across the screen) and flexible beam, which uses up (self-restoring) energy.
