 An unusual game for SNK since they are renowned for their 2D fighting games.  Cool Cool Toon at first glance seems nothing more than a cash in on the popular (at the time) rhythm games.  But at a closer look you'll see it's got it's own unique style that to be honest isn't exactly the best system out there.  The game is tricky to play due to the positioning of the buttons that you have to do using the analogue controller and at times impossible to judge what is the next button to press.  But it's not all bad.  The graphics are ok but I think Samba De Amigo is much better looking.  The music is a mix bag from poor to great songs but they all have a very interesting why of changing depending upon your skill level, a bit like NiGHTS on the Saturn.
