 Pilot your Z-42 Warpstar starfight as Earth's last line of defense against the advance of the Evil Empire. Last Hope - a self-described "tactical shooter" plays much like a  tougher version of a classic game R-Type. The game, however, adds a minor innovation to the tried and true formula by allowing the player to rotate the protection pod 360Â° around the ship. The game features six distinct stages and four weapons.
