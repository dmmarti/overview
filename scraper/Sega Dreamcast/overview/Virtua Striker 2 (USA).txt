 It's here, Virtua Striker 2  has come to Dreamcast in all its arcade-perfect glory. Play any of the new modes - including 'Ranking' and 'Leagues' - or just sit back and enjoy the original arcade mode from the comfort of your armchair. You can save the best goal on your VM unit and use it when your competing in two-player mode.   Football has never looked so good and felt so right... you can almost taste the pie and Bovril at half time.
