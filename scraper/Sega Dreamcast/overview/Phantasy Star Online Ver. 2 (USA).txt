 The world's first online console RPG gets an update with PSO Ver. 2. New items and weapons, new online games and play modes, a Dressing Room, new areas to explore, and the Ultimate Difficulty mode have been added. You can also bring in your PSO characters, modify them in the Dressing Room, and attempt Ultimate Mode and strive to reach Level 200!  PSO Ver. 2 functions as a stand-alone game, as well as an add-on. You don't need to have owned PSO in order to play.
