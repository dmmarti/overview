 Although being another tennis title for the Dreamcast, Net De Tennis differs to Segaâ€™s Virtua or Power Smash Tennis series, not just visually but also in the way it plays. Unlike Sega's title, there is not so much focus on reaction and speed in Net De Tennis. Instead the crux of the gameplay is based on strategy and the ability to outwit your opponent and while it makes the game feel more realistic than its graphics initially lets on, it also takes away a little of the arcade fun. The speed also can feel a little bit sluggish at time, so set up plays feel infinitely more considered.  Controls are tight, with just one button for a lob shot and another for regular shot but each shot can be swerved depending on how you move the control, essentially give you a more deeper control system than at first meets the eye.
