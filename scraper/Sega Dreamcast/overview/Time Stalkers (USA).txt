 You are walking down a lonely country road, thinking about a girl when suddenly you are attacked. You fend him off with your sword, he runs.  You are Sword the mighty warrior, so you give chase and find yourself, eventually, in a land that is a quiltwork of different cultures and styles.   You have been selected to save this world.  As you complete each challenge,  another land is added to the core world.  As you progress,  you gain allies and eventually have up to 6 characters to use for your quests.  You can capture and build up monsters to assist you.  You can purchase and create weapons to defeat your foes.  You can even use credits gained in the VMU games to help in the development of your characters and dungeons.
