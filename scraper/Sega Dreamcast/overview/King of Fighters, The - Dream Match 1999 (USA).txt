 A special Dreamcast conversion of KOF '98 (NOT '99) with several additions for Sega's console. The game remains the same as the original arcade version, but now includes new backgrounds (some with some polygonal enhancements) and a series of complementary bonus materials like conceptual galleries, sound test modes, etc.
