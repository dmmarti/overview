 Reel Fishing: Wild is a Dreamcast-exclusive entry in the fishing simulation series. It allows players to catch two dozen species of fish in 14 different locations all over the world, from Japan to North and South America to Oceania. The Dreamcast fishing rod controller is supported for realistic castings and reel-ins. The game starts in the fishing lodge, where players can check out a fish glossary, their catch list and their stock of lures, reels and lines and rods. Going for a round of fishing is done via the fishing notebook, which presents players with a series of challenges. At the start, only one location - a Japanese mountain stream - is unlocked. To unlock others, a certain number of a particular species must be caught. Catching fish not only opens up new locations, but also gives access to new types of lures, reels and lines, and rods, which in turn allow more successful fishing. A fishing session begins with a photo-realistic first-person view of the location created through combining digitized images with some animation, like for a waterfall or swaying trees, as well as disturbances of the water surface that hint at the best places for casting. Once the line is cast and a fish moves near the lure, the view switches to a 3D underwater view, showing fish, line, and hook in close-up. Baiting, setting the hook, and reeling in the catch are then done in this view.
