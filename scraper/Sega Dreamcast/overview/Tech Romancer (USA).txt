 Tech Romancer is a 3D beat-em-up with a difference; the difference being that, rather than controlling one of a set of martial artists, you control one of a set of huge robots (or mecha). Ranging from the absurd (A huge, spherical mech with a boat and bus for feet, a house for a head, train for one arm and office building with wrecking ball for another) to the andquot;typicalandquot; anime styled mecha (Beam-firing chest gem, detatchable rocket-powered fists) to a more westernised idea of a mech (Huge, sluggish, equipped with heavy cannon, rockets, missiles and land-mines), you're bound to find at least one which suits you. The gameplay takes part in large, 3D arenas, usually dotted with buildings and such, which you'll no doubt be happy to learn are destructable (and often contain powerups). The game controls consist of two attack buttons, one block and one jump. You have a special bar, which works pretty much the same as any other special bar - once it's full (up to a maximum of 3 times) you can pull off a special move. There's an armour bar, which depletes as you take or block certain hits - if it runs out then you'll start taking hefty damage even when blocking. The life and time-bars are self-explanatory, and there's also the special-weapon inventory, which can hold up to five special weapons at a time (these are picked up from the battlefield or stolen off the enemy). The main single-player mode is a story mode, which is completely different for each character and, for most characters at least, branches many ways, often with multiple endings depending on choices made and targets met.  To put it simply, this is a quirky pick-up-and-play fighting game with an extensive single-player mode.
