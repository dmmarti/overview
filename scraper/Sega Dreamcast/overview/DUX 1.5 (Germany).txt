 DUX is a scrolling shooter in the vein of R-Type. When scientists searched for new materials to enhance their space ships, they discovered a new and powerful material they dubbed DUX. Since this type of material proved unstable, nobody except the player seemed brave enough to fly the space ship constructed from it. The player's job is to lead the ship through a series of horizontal levels against the Spiritual Spacers "to reach the obvious."  The player's ship has a standard laser shot that can be upgraded or changed for x-ray and bounce shots, which are very similar to the weapons in R-Type. The player also has a pod that protects them from enemy bullets and that can be launched as an offensive weapon in a move called "dash." Keeping the fire button pressed will launch a more powerful hyper shot.  To score points, the player can destroy chains of enemies in quick succession or soak up chains of bullets. Hyper Soaking makes the player invulnerable to bullets, but drains the Obvious Energy gauge if not enough bullets are soaked in or new energy orbs are picked up. The player wins the game if they manage to beat all the bosses at the end of each level. If they are hit by a bullet or collide with their surroundings, a life is lost. After all lives and continues are depleted, the game is over.
