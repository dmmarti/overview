 The first game in the NBA 2K series; this realistic basketball simulation is Sega's answer to NBA Live.  Play an exhibition game, an entire season or jump straight to the playoffs. The game has all 29 teams and their stars. Players are realistically modeled and have recognizable faces and even tattoos - a novelty. You can also create your own players with the player editor.  NBA 2K features the 1999-2000 team rosters.
