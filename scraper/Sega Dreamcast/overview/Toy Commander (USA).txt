 Some of the greatest adventures that kids have growing up occur in their imaginations as they play with their toys.  Toy Commander is a game that attempts to capture these adventures in an interactive, three dimensional world. The player's perspective is that of the toy vehicles that inhabit a house. The various gameplay areas are all based on rooms in this giant house.   Gameplay in Toy Commander is mission based.  In each mission, you control one or more toy vehicles to accomplish certain objectives. The objectives in each mission vary widely.  In some missions, you must drive an army truck and shoot things, in some you fly helicopters to pick up and drop off objects, and in some you must race against computer controlled vehicles.   There is a story line that ties together the missions in single player mode. A coalition of old toys has started a rebellion against the new toys in the house. An evil Teddy Bear, the Toy Commander, is leading this rebellion.  It's your job to stop him. In each mission, your basic goal is to complete the task in as short a time as possible.  If you meet a certain time goal, the mission is completed.  By completing 4 missions, you get to challenge the Boss character in the room.  If you successfully destroy the boss, he will assist you in the final fight against the Toy Commander.  In addition to the single player mode, there is a 4-player simultaneous deathmatch mode.
