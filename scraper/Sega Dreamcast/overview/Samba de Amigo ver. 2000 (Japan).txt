 This game is the update to the original, maraca shaking, Samba de Amigo. However, a lot more has been added than in most updates. A new hustle mode of play complements the original mode and the song list has almost been doubled, with many new songs such as Vamos de Carnaval, the theme from Rocky and even the Wedding March being included. For anyone who thought they had the original game mastered, there's even a survival mode where you have to play through all 43 songs making a maximum of 8 mistakes in total. The core gameplay effectively remains the same as the original though. This game was only released in Japan.
