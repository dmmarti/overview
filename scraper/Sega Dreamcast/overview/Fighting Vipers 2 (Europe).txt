 This game is a sequel to Fighting Vipers, a 3D fighting game that allows you to face adolescents and adults that comes from different "urban tribes", but also, in that second version you can choose or beat another time the most charismatic characters of FV1 and some unedited characters never seen again (either in FV2 arcade, version appeared in 1998 on Model 3 arcade board).  FV2, as in FV, has the incentive to destroy the fight arena walls with the last combat impact, also, you can destroy again the armor of your opponent, that as a newness in 1998's FV2, includes the "Super KO System", in which, if you break the armor of your opponent and immediately, you make a Super Combo that leaves him "confused", you will win without dispute a second round.
