 Much like every other platform game ever made, you control a character around a 3D world full of deadly (and not so deadly) characters. In this case, Kao the Kangaroo has been stolen from his home, and you must help him get back to the great land down under. To aid his quest, Kao wears boxing gloves, which he can use to bump the bad guys clear out of the way.
