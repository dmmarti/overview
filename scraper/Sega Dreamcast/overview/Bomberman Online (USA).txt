 Multiplayer is up to ten players online similar to Atomic Bomberman for PC with traditional four-player game on one system. The game includes the ability to edit characters, to gather to keep or trade collectibles, a super weapon called the Hyper Bomb, new rules, exclusive stages, and finally, never-before-seen modes like the Panel Mode (like Othello, you must flip panels to match your color) or Battle Royale (where you must attempt to ring-out your opponents).
