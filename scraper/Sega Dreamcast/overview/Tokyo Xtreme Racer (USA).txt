 Get in your fast car and race around the Tokyo highway at night, challenging drivers from rival gangs to a race. The winner gets a cash prize, so you can upgrade your car or buy a new one. If you start winning consistently enough, you soon become famous enough to be challenged by various gang leaders, and finally the four Devils, who are the best, fastest, and least seen drivers of the night.
