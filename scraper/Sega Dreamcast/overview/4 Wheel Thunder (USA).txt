 4 Wheel Thunder is the off-road racing sequel to the popular power-boat racing game, Hydro Thunder.  In this game, players race around two types of courses; huge outdoor tracks and smaller indoor tracks. All in all, there are 24 areas in which to race, including various day/night, rain/sunshine variations. The game includes the standard championship, practice race, and 2-player modes.  The thunder series of games is unique in that the key to winning the race lies not in careful steering and braking, but in finding the andquot;boostandquot; power-ups that lie around the tracks.  Each boost icon adds a few seconds of time to your boost meter. The player then can press a boost button to increase the speed of his or her truck dramatically. Without the boost power-ups, the player has no hope of winning a race.
