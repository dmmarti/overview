 Shenmue 2 is the sequel to the innovative free-roaming RPG Shenmue. Continuing on exactly from where the original left off, Shenmue 2 furthers the story of Ryo Hazuki and his search for his fathers murderer, Lan-Di, as well as the events surrounding the murder.  Taking place in China, Shenmue 2 contains a real world gameplay system first seen in the original Shenmue. This puts you in a world where hundreds of people live out their daily lives around you, day turns to evening and on into night. It rains and snows, you can get part time jobs to earn extra money for rent or even gamble or play real classic arcade games like Outrun at the local video arcade all within a living breathing city. There is also a battle mode for those occasions when Ryo gets himself into fights as well as quick time events that require you to act quickly in the heat of some tense situations.  The Xbox version of the game came with an additional DVD called Shenmue: The Movie, which contained a summation of the first Shenmue game made into a feature length movie. This was to help people who didn't own a Dreamcast understand the plot from the previous game, since it was never released for the Xbox.
