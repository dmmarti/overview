 Plus Plumbs is another one of those match 3 coloured balls together type puzzle games.  With this title however there's a nice little twist.  You see, your playing area is some sort of scale so not only do you have to worry about your balls hitting the top but also the other player doing well enough to push his half of the scales down and your half up.  If that wasn't enough to worry about you also have to remember that your balls will change colour once a combination has been preformed.  Of course the colour changing is always the same such as a red ball will change to a green ball and so on.
