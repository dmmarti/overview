 Todd McFarlane's dark comic book anti-hero, Spawn, is ready to give your Dreamcast hell. Play as Spawn (a.k.a. Al Simmons), or any of the anti-heroes or villains from the comics, such as Clown, Twitch, Overtkill, Angel, Redeemer and more in a battle royale blastfest. Not up to killing just anyone? Play Team Battle and join with a friend to blast those other guys! Just do your best to get to the big guy downstairs: Maelebogia, to reclaim your soul and return to life.
