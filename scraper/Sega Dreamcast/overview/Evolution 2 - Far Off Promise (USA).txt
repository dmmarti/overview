 Evolution 2 is a direct sequel to World of Sacred Device. The events of the game take place six months after the conclusion of the previous game. Mag Launcher, the son of a great adventurer of the past, has earned the title of "best adventurer" in the town Pannam. The adventurer guild (called the Society) sends him to the south, to the large town Museville. Mag has to explore the surrounding dungeons, performing various archaeological quests for the Society.  The game is more like a second chapter to the first Evolution than an actual sequel. You control the same party of characters: Mag, the cute girl Linear Cannon, the butler Gre Naid, and the adventurers Chain and Pepper. The dungeons are randomly generated. In those dungeons, you can find rare artifacts you can later sell, and special weapon enhancements called "CyFrame", which can upgrade your characters and teach them various techniques.  The US version of Evolution: Far off Promise features original Japanese voice-acting with English subtitles.
