 The third game in the series (the first 2 were on the PSX and called Fellony 11-79 in the west), and basicly you drive around San Francisco crashing into things.  There are 2 scenarios, Scenario A places you in control of San Francisco Motors, a kind of "messenger/delivery/bomb disposal service" rolled up in one, while Scenario B has you playing the role of some laid-back San Francisco police officers. The two scenarios have different missions, whether it's stopping a runaway cable car, or collecting bombs for disposal.
