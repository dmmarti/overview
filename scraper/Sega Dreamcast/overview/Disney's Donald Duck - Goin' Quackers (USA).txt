 You play as Donald in this 3d platform action game.  Donald's girlfriend, Daisy is a reporter for a television station in Duckberg.  While doing a story on the secret temple of Merlock, a terrible magician, Daisy is kidnapped.  Now, it is up to Donald to get her back.  Along the way he will have help from his nephews, Huey, Dewey, and Louie, and the inventor Gyro Gearloose.  He will also have competition from Gladstone Gander, who is also trying to save Daisy.
