 Originally came in limited numbers with Capcom VS SNK 2, the Capcom Taisen Fan Disc is actually a very nice fan disc.  Containing character profiles and all art forms (SNK, Capcom and anime types) for every single character in the Capcom Vs SNK games.  Not only that but you also get each characters back ground music as well!  Fans of Capcom Vs SNK 2 will like the VS battle data that can be saved to your VMU from the disc.  You can then load up this data on Capcom VS SNK 2 to watch some real hard core battles directly from Capcom.  And finally Capcom have also added special VMU save data for pretty much every single one of their games released on the Dreamcast all the way up to Heavy Metal Geo Matrix.  Strangely though, there's no Bio Hazard Code Veronica data but there is Net De Tennis data.
