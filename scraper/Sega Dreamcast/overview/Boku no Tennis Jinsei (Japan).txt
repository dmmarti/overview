 My Tennis Life in English is the work of the super small software house Bimboosoft (poor soft, as in no money) who also brought Dreamcast lovers the very nice Jetcoaster Dream 1 and 2.  Boku No Tennis Jinsei isn't really what I'd call a premium tennis game such as Power Smash or even games such as the classic Super Tennis or Family Tennis on the Super Famicom.  The problem with this game is that the collision detection seems to be off at times meaning that you can actually hit the ball even though you can clearly see that your racket didn't touch it.  Add the fact that it's pretty tough to judge distance and you have yourself one dodgy tennis game.  Still, it does have a charm that makes it worth picking up if you can find it cheap enough.  The problem is that you probably won't find it cheap enough since this was never really released in great numbers making it quite a tough one to find these days
