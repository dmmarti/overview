 The first and only Mortal Kombat title to make onto the Dreamcast console, Mortal Kombat Gold offered players a carbon-copy of the arcade edition of Mortal Kombat 4, along with additional features and characters never before included in the arcade game.  Using the exact same engine found in Mortal Kombat 4, the game performs flawlessly on the Dreamcast platform, while also running at a higher resolution than its arcade counterpart.
