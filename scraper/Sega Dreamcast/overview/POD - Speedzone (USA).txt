 POD SpeedZone is the sequel to the original POD for the PC.  It is a simple, futuristic racer, where you are able to attack your opponents.  You are a miner on the colony of Damethra, and an alien virus has taken over the cars on the colony, creating mutant cars.  It was one of the first games playable on SegaNet, and one of the only games to support the Dreamcast Broadband Adaptor.  This game features eight different vehicles to use on five 3D tracks.
