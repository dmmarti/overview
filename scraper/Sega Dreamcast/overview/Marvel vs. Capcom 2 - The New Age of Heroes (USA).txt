 Marvel vs. Capcom 2: New Age of Heroes is the sequel to the 2D fighting game Marvel vs. Capcom: Clash of Super Heroes.   The game allows you to tag in all three players (instead of two, while the third is only used for special attacks, in the predecessor).  There are now up to 56 characters to use (most you have to unlock), including new characters like Jill Valentine from Resident Evil and Tron Bonn from Mega Man Legends.  Another new gameplay feature allows your team mates to come in during battle and give you a little health boost. This helps in lasting the distance in Survival mode, but they can also be hit by on coming attacks from the enemy.
