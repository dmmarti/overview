 SEGA Bass Fishing 2 is the obvious sequel to SEGA Bass Fishing. Like the previous game in the series this simulation game allows the player to fish for bass on various lakes. At the start of the game the player can pick one of various characters. Each character has his or her own stats such as casting distance, which makes them all unique. Each character's appearance can be altered by the player as well.  Using sonar the player can cruise around the lake until he find a good fishing spot. Besides the location the player can also pick the month, time of day and weather in which he wants to fish. All these factors are calculated when it comes to determining what kind of fish he or she is likely to catch. To aid the player there's 100 different kinds of lures to fish with.  The game is meant to be played with the special fishing rod controller.  There are two game modes: free fishing and tournament mode. In the first you can do what you wish and try to improve on your own records. In the latter mode you have to compete against NPCs or another player. There are various tiers of difficulty.
