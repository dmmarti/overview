 Macross M3 is a 3-D shooting, arcade-style single-player game for the Sega Dreamcast. Like Macross Digital Mission VF-X or Macross VF-X2, this game allowed players to play various Macross-universe mecha in a variety of missions. Players were allowed to select from Maximilian Jenius, Milia Jenius, or Moaramia Jenius (later in the game) as playable pilots.
