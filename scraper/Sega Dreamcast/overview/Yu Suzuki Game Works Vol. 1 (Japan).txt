 Great book covering Yu Suzuki's work from the mid 80's to present day with VF 4.  It comes with a Dreamcast GDROM of classic arcades produced by Yu Suzuki.  On the GDROM is Space Harrier, Hang On (NOT AN ARCADE CONVERSION !!! because it says Shenmue on the background billboards!!), Afterburner II, Out Run and Power Drift.  If you've played Shenmue 1 and 2 then you've seen everything this disc has to offer apart from Power Drift which is still a cool game even by today's standards.
