 Don't be put off by the pretty awful cover, Musapey's Choco Maker is actually a pretty addictive puzzler coming to beloved Dreamcast straight from the Naomi arcade original. Musapey's is probably best described as a marsupial like creature.  In a typical one-player game your marsupial is dropped onto the playing field, a collection of various colored cubes with a special cube called ''boss'' at the center of the mess. Your creature freely walks six sides of the playfield using a block it stands upon (you lay these blocks down with a press of a button) eliminating other blocks/rows to clear the playfield leaving only the boss block remaining.  A time limit adds another layer of challenge.  Eliminating blocks is simple, it's akin to a sandwich, say you have a yellow block, plop a red block at one end of the block and do the same at the other end (R,Y,R), the entire row will disappear. In addition any loose blocks hanging on that row will disappear as well. These extra blocks will add a few seconds back to the clock, quite handy. The game doesn't dictate the length of a row but the more blocks you eliminate the more your bomb gauge fills which yields a block that wipes out blocks in a set radius. Using gravity to take out multiple rows and gray blocks that have to transformed to be removed add another facet to the gameplay, elevating the simple premise into a deep game.
