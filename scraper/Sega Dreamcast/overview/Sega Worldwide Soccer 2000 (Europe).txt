 Sega Worldwide Soccer 2000 is a direct sequel of the widely acclaimed WWS'98. There are many club and international teams to choose from, as well as multiple authentic fields to play on. There are also all of the basic play modes, including a championship, exhibition match and a couple of cup-styled erm...cups. All of the player's movements are motion captured and there is also quite a few graphical touches to liven things up, like the managers shouting from the sidelines and quite realistic-looking crowds. All in all, this is your basic football/soccer game.
