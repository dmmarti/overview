 This game is an updated edition of Last Hope. The game is basically the same, but some modifications have been made to decrease the difficulty. This includes, for example, more levels of difficulty to choose from, and starting with a better equipped  and faster moving ship. Further, the standard enemy shots are now coloured in bright pink (thus the name of the re-release) to make them more visible, and the general colour themes of the stages have been adapted to increase the visibility, too.
