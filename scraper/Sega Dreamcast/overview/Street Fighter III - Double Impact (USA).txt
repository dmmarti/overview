 After years of waiting, the true third sequel to Street Fighter is upon us.   3 Familiar faces in Ryu, Ken and Akuma appear in the roster, with 12 new faces including Sean, Yun, Yang, Alex, Ibuki, Elena, Dudley, Oro, Necro, Hugo, Urien and Gill. But even though they are new, the moves will seem familiar for those who have played other versions in the SF series.
