 Lack of Love (or L.O.L.) is an adventure / RPG hybrid based on the evolution of an alien being. In the beginning you are just born, but the alien world is harsh, and so you constantly have to improve yourself, learn new things and avoid being eaten by other animals. And to make your new life even harder, an alien robot race just discovered the planet and starts colonizing it. Surviving is obviously not easy...  The game is played from an isometric perspective in front of detailed prerendered backgrounds. As you are an animal the game doesn't have any ingame texts - for solving riddles you are totally dependent on experimentation and careful observation of the environment. To reach the next state of evolution you will also need to help other beings - as a reward they will give you energy balls or new abilities required for further progress.  Besides the usual actions like attacking / biting and talking (or better communicating) you have somewhat strange actions sleeping and urinating which are essential to the gameplay.
