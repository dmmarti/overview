 Coaster Works puts the player in the role of a roller coaster engineer, recently hired to help construct several different roller coasters for different amusement parks.  The construction part is set up with a screen divided in four camera angles and a grid based building tool. Using vector pieces, the player has to make a roller coaster that meets the requirements of the specific park. The pieces can be tilted, elevated, lowered and turned to make sure the ride is as exciting as possible.  After the roller coaster is done it will be tested with a crash test dummy (who's also able to squeal like an excited kid), to make sure it meets such requirements as safety, speed, excitement etc. This is done in a 1st person view, allowing the player to come along for the ride as well.  There are 6 different stages, each with different sizes and limitations.
