 A slight change from the normal excessive number of F1 games out there, Spirit of Speed 1937 was an attempt to put you into the driving seat of some of the oldest, and well known, racing cars of the early-century. Take control of one of the 1930s cars and race it out around tracks, many of which are no longer available for professional competitive racing.  Whilst being a nice attempt to add some sparkle to a tired genre, many aspects of the game feel either wrong or awkward. Yes, the steering wasn't as nice on the old cars, but in simulating this the gameplay has become much harder. And why do all the cars shine as if made of polished chrome? A good attempt, but not one that rose to the surface of the day's gaming titles.
