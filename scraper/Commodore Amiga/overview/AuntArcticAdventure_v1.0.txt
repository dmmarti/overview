 Aunt Arctic Adventure is a platform game in which the player must guide Charlie the chimp through the levels to rescue his Aunt, who has been kidnapped and taken to the Arctic to work as a circus performer.  The game supports one or two players with the second player controlling Penguin Pete. Avoid baddies such as eskimos, spiders and penguins, whilst picking up items such as bananas to score extra points.
