 This game offers a simulation of the popular British Touring Car Championship of the early 90s. Four different cars are featured, from Toyota, BMW, Nissan and Vauxhall, which make up the 24-car grid. The game features accurate re-creations of Brands Hatch, Silverstone, Donington Park and Oulton Park. You can practice each track, or do single races or championships, over 3,5 or 7 laps, although you always start 10th on the grid with no qualifying. The race is viewed from above and behind your car, similarly to the Lotus Challenge series.
