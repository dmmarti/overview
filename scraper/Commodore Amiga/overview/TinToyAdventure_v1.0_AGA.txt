The House of Fun is no fun anymore. An evil clown used a magic spell to bring the house into his possession; including all of its inhabitants. The only one spared is the tin man who now has to travel through the side-scrolling levels in order to fight the clown. This game offers the standard platforming action: jumping to avoid falling in holes and touching enemies - if not successful in the latter task, the energy bar decreases which eventually leads to death. However, the player character is not defenseless: he can shoot little sparks at the enemies and he has four spells to his disposal. The latter are basically power-ups which can be activated at will: creating a temporary platform under his feet, floating, invulnerability and a smart bomb. All those spells are limited regarding the number of usages, but refills can be collected during the levels. A boss awaits shortly before each level exit.
