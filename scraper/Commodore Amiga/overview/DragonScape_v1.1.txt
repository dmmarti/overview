In Dragon Scape, the player takes the role of a young man who gets magically transported into the land Tuvania. The peace has been disturbed by the evil King of Kaos who has to be defeated. The protagonist has to ride a dragon, find 40 artifacts and bring them to the corresponding places. The artifacts can only be dropped at the correct location.

Of course there are enemies which try to stop the player and can be destroyed by using the dragon's fire breath. Besides the artifact collecting, the game plays out as a traditional multi-directional scrolling shooter. There are five levels with eight artifacts each.
