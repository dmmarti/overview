 You star as half-robot operative Stryx. Dome City is under attack by KILLER CYBORG ASSASSINS! You navigate Stryx through numerous levels on foot, hovercrafts and some weird round eyeball-type flying craft. It's basic side scrolling action/arcade whackiness. This game was released for IBM PC, Amiga and Atari ST systems.
