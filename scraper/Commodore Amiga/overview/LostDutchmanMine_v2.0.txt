 One of the most exhaustedly researched games I've ever played; you're an old timer looking for the andquot;Lost Dutchman Mineandquot;. The game begins you with a scarce amount of gold to buy the items you'll need to not only survive in the desert, but for gold panning and you'll need that pick axe! Along the way, you'll encounter those other folks that'll run you out of the area with shotguns and pistols! Watch out! A poisonous snake can end it all or if you're lucky you can make it back into town to the doc for a cure. Good luck old timer - if you're ever gonna search the Superstition Mountains with luck - well, you get my drift.  EVERY TIME you play, the game changes everything; the map, supplies available and more.
