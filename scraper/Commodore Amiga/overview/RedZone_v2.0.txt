 Red Zone sees Psygnosis attempt to simulate motorcycle racing using 3D polygon graphics, in a similar way to Team Suzuki and No Second Prize. Ten different circuits are featured in the game's championship, although there are no bike setup options. The graphical detail level can be set, which affects the game's running speed and smoothness.   The mouse is used for control, with options to vary the sensitivity of the response as well as the skill of the opposition. The game keeps track of how many times you punted an opponent off, and how many times you endangered one with your riding.
