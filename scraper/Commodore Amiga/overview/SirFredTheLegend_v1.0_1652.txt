 Sir Fred was a brave and noble knight in love with a beautiful damsel, but evil Ultimor, an ugly dwarf with magical powers, casted a spell upon him and minimized to the size of the dwarf. Enemies were laughing at him, and other dwarfs were attacking him. What he should do? Yes, he should find and defeat Ultimor, return his size to be brave and noble enough, and to win back his belle.  The gameplay flows in 2D side-scrolling mode, where you may use your sword, throw the daggers, and avoid the enemies. You may walk, jump and run, and perform this not in one plane.
