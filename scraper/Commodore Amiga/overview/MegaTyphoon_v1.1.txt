Mega Typhoon is a vertically scrolling shooter. As usual, the player takes control over a space ship with the goal to kill every evil alien which moves. The focus is fast-paced action and many enemy formations to kill. Of course there are also various power-ups to collect which upgrade the ship's weapon systems or shields. Useful is the limited amounts of smart of bombs which clears the whole screen.
