 Save the earth from a fanatical Russian group that wants to end life as we know it!  Atop a special space station, you repair defense satellites, battle rocket fighters in outer space, and destroy launched missiles before they hit their target to save the planet--or try to rescue your Russian Commander lover held hostage on a space station halfway around the world?
