 The game has a lot of things going for it. The game itself is a lot deeper than the title would suggest in that it is about more than just Carl Lewis. You can select from a variety of countries to enter your athletes from, and then train them to hone their abilities before the real competition begins. The events are varied and range from running the 100 meter dash to the javelin throw. And the selection of athletes is generous with a good selection of both male and female stars. by Hugh F from underdogs
