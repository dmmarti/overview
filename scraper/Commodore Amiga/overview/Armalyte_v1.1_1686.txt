 In the Delta region of space, the remnants of a long forgotten war remain - far beyond what those in the Terran system were used to. This technology is potentially valuable, but retrieving it from the 8 sectors will involve a lot of blasting and dodging.  Viewed from the side and scrolling horizontally, the game is in a similar vein to R-Type and Life Force / Salamander. Extra weapons are gained by shooting crystals and then collecting the resultant pod.  Weapons on offer including lasers firing vertically and outwardly, as well as faster weaponry recharging.
