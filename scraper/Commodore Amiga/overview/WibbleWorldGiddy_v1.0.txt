 Giddy was strolling around when suddenly he was sucked into a vortex and transported to a bizarre forest. He now has to find his way home, avoiding dangers and solving puzzles in his wake.  Wibble World Giddy is an Amiga freeware clone of Dizzy and its sequels. Intended as parody of that classic series, it also stars an anthropomorphic egg that must collect objects in order to solve puzzles. At the top on the left side of the screen there are two counters, one for lives and other for coins. On the top-right side there is an energy bar. If the egg touches any of the enemies or harmful environments and objects, this energy bar decreases, and when it is completely drained the egg explodes with an onomatopoeic SPLAT!, and the player loses a life. Below both items is a black strip that displays the inventory content when in use mode pulling the joystick DOWN  and pressing FIRE enters the use mode, where the player moves the joystick left or right to cycle through the assembled inventory, and hits FIRE to use the selected object.
