 Amegas is a Breakout variant which conforms to, and expands on the play mechanics of the established Arkanoid canon.   The basic lay remains to control a bat which slides back and forth at the bottom of the screen. Stacks of coloured bricks are arranged in patterns above. The object is being to bounce a ball to hit the bricks to make them disappear. Some bricks' require multiple hits to destroy - visually indicated by dots shown on the face.  Some special bricks are distinguished from others by unique icons, e.g. one with a' skull' will result in a loss of life if hit by the ball, or one with an ï¾‘x' mark will cause new bricks to spawn and spread.    At times bricks will yield colour-coded pickups which topple down and may be caught, resulting in a special power-up feature being given. A unique play facet presented here is that power-ups' are not activated automatically, but rather are reserved - The player may utilise the last power-up collected upon clicking the right mouse button, this remains true even if a ball is lost.
