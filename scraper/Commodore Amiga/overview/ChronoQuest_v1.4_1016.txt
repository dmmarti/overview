 Chrono Quest is an adventure game told in still images and text windows. Controls are implemented by various icons around the screen border. The gameplay basically is somewhere in between modern pointandclick adventures and graphics-supplemented interactive fiction. The plot starts off some time around 1920 in the mansion of the main character's father, which was murdered and left the protagonist as the main suspect. In the course of exploring the mansion, the player finds a time machine and starts tracking down his father's murderer through the ages...
