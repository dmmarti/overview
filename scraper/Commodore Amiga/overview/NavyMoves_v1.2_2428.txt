 My name is McArra and I belong to the special pacification forces. My mission: find and destroy a nuclear submarine U-5544 that has unbalanced the forces between the two most powerful Earth armies. The name of the operation is Cephalopod and I have heard that you want to help me in this easy mission.  At first, we will be sent near the island where is anchored the submarine awaiting orders. We will swim to the coast, and once there... everything will depend on us.  Navy Moves is a one-dimensional side scrolling shooter, and the sequel of Army Moves and has the same gaming style.
