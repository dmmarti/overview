 Rings of Medusa is a mixture of strategy, role-playing and business-simulation game. Located in a medieval setting, you take over the part of the son of the former king of this kingdom. Unfortunately an evil sorceress, called Medusa, has taken control of the country and is now dominating the people.  Your task is to find five magical rings that will give you the power to overthrow the sorceress and claim back your heritage. In the beginning you'll try to earn money by doing trade between different towns or try your luck at bounty hunting or at treasure hunts. Once you've earned enough money to maintain a larger army, you'll send forth your men to search for the rings which are in the possession of large soldier of fortune armies rallying the lands.  Sometimes you'll take part in small arcade sequences like sword fighting, sea fights or control your army on the battle field.
