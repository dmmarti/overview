 You are a pilot of some robot/spacejet transformer on some deserted planet full of cacti and enemy ships. You may turn left/right at the angle of 45 degrees, move at the angle of 45 degrees, accelerate/decelerate speed of your moving, shoot, and metamorphose into a spacejet at will. During 12 levels of gameplay enemies fly towards you, and you should shoot them or avoid them, because each meeting with the enemy means decreasing the number of instances of your transformer. You'll also need to collect spheres to maintain your fuel levels. When all instances of your spacejet will be lost you may be enlisted in the High Score Table.
