 A complex game in which you can create your own ecosystems, animals or vegetables, then watch them eat, evolve, mate, or die.  Feel free to create funky animals! How about a giant snail that would have to eat several trees each day to survive - or a small kangaroo that would lay eggs and eat only bugs? You can even edit their DNA code, and make your animals mutate.
