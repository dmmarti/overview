 In a far-off land, an evil force is in charge, and you set off with the intention of putting things right. Immediately you see signs of desolation and environmental failure, with lifeless and malnourished people all round. Still, you must not give up; your friend who lives amidst this needs your help. With full graphical depiction of events and places, this interactive fiction can be played purely using the keyboard, but the bottom half of the screen contains some mouse interaction for direction entry. You can move in four directions, examine and take objects, talk to people and solve puzzles.
