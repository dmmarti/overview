 Super TaeKwonDo Master is a 2D action martial arts simulator for 1 or 2 players. Like Mortal Kombat the game uses fully digitized characters, superimposed into a computer generated world in splendid graphical glory. Settings include a combat hall, backstreets and a fuel dump. Sequences of joystick moves are used to trigger special moves.  Unlike Mortal Kombat and the like, the moves are purely realistic. There's no hurling fireballs at your enemy here, you must be a quality fighter to take on these guys. Strategy and skill are of the utmost importance. Unlike the non-'Super' version, this edition runs on non-AGA systems as well as AGA.
