 A city has been formed from the bones of a long-dead Orodrid creature, and you are from one of the families that controls this. Finding and hatching a Crystallion egg, which is located within the Tsirit skull. This involves several distinct stages of gameplay.  The Tsirit involves navigating maze-like monster-infested pathways, armed with plasma bolts and a protective suit. Within this you will encounter Bosu, a marble-based game played on a board. The Proda involves placing matching pairs of crystals in such a way that they will be charged by beams of light.   All the while, you must play the Haresh section, to keep your family under control. This involves financial trading; getting a fair price for the goods you produce, and buying the right amounts of food, clothes and other essentials. Money must also be donated to the Tsirit.
