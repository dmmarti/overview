 In this sequel to the game Mercenary, the planet Eris is in danger: A comet, fittingly named Damocles, is on a straight collision course with the planet. Within only a few hours, the comet will obliterate Eris.  It is your job to prevent this. In the maddeningly short time frame, you will have to explore the galaxy which contains 9 planets and 19 moons and try to find a way to stop the comet.  Just like Mercenary, you play this game in the first person perspective, this time however with detailed filled polygon graphics. You can walk on the planets, drive vehicles and fly spaceships. It is very non-linear, you can go to any planet and any moon at any time and do whatever you like. You'll have to find and use objects and examine buildings and places... and stay away from Eris if you can't destroy Damocles in time!
