In Ringside you can chart your aspiring fighter's progress from untried stripling to awesome killing machine, well, almost, but you can rise up the world ratings by challenging and beating opponents.

There are a fair selection of punches and tactics. The punches themselves are hardly textbook affairs, nor are they aesthetically executed, but they do seem able to bruise your opponent.

Game has better than average graphics and well defined sprites, but a boxing simulation stands or falls on the flexibility of its play. Standing next to someone and thumping them can get very boring. Ringside is reduced to a fairly static and visually unexciting game. Not even the absurd sequence between rounds where you have to wave a towel over your boxer by fiercely woggling the joystick can alter this.

Ringside can be a good laugh either in the one player or in the two player mode. Then again, no-one gets their nose broken.
