 Year 2019, Manhattan. After a nuclear war.    Out of the ashes comes a hero, Jonathan Rogers, better known as Jungle Rogers, the owner of the asphalt jungle. The only chance of survival is to reach the airdrop platform XV-238, located in the control base of the schizophrenic assassin professor McJerin, and to escape to outer colonies.  There is no easy way to do this. The game is a side-scrolling shoot 'em up, with thugs coming at you constantly, and a few moves to use on them. You must cross the dangerous streets of Manhattan, which have become over-run by feral thieves. Later he awaits for the guardians of the scientific complex of McJerin.
