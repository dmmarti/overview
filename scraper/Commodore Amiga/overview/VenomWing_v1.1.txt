For any space pilot, The Fortresses contain all the wealth any man could imagine so men have tried and many have failed. The few who have succeeded enjoyed the wealth but that amount turned them crazy and protective of the wealth and so became guardians of the four fortresses. You are a wealthy experienced pilot looking for that one last challenge, so you are determined to fly your ship and conquer it all, not for the money, just because it's there. If the going gets too tough you can change into an eagle for a short time, you are invulnerable but you can't fire.

Venom Wing is a side scrolling shoot-em-up where the screen scrolls automatically over four levels. Levels one and three have you gradually scrolling downwards before facing an end of level boss. Levels two and four are more traditional horizontal scrolling from left to right before facing them end of level bosses again. There are various power-up icons to collect including triple fire, a drone to fly with you and one to change into the eagle.
