 Twenty-two years ago a powerful cleric named Estoroth Paingiver was banished and sealed in a crypt. He has been gaining strength since then and is now threatening the country of Astera again. You must take control of a party of four adventurers sent to find and seal Estoroth again by recovering the lost relics that sent him into exile in the past.  Black Crypt is a first-person perspective 3D dungeon exploration game similar to the Dungeon Master and Eye of the Beholder series.
