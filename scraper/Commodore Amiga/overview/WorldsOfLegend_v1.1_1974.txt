 Worlds of Legend is the follow-up to Legend for the Amiga.  The game is in essence the same as the former game - an isometric 3D FRPG. It is now set in an Eastern environment but once again you take control of the four characters Barbarian, Runemaster, Assassin and Troubadour, as you're required to solve puzzles and conquer dungeons. Again you can encounter hostile armies on the plains as well, but the landscape has changed.  A new feature allows you to import your characters from the original game, with all their gold, weapons and level enhancements, although you can generate them from the start again.
