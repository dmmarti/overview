In Frantic Freddie your goal is to clear all of the buckets of gold from each single screen level. Each level features a unique form of monster that will chase you relentlessly and try to stop you from finishing. Strewn about the levels are ladders that act as both obstacles and your means of getting around the screen. You cannot pass through a ladder but rather must ascend it in order to climb down on the opposite side. Bonus items such as stars and hearts can be grabbed as they pass through the level, scoring you more points. The gold buckets are randomly distributed on the levels which varies the difficulty in every game. Completing two levels in a row will reveal an interlude depicting Freddie versus a large frog monster. There are two interludes which are repeated. Each level also has a musical theme that plays. After sixteen levels you have completed the game.
