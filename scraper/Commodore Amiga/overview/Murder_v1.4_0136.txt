 After personalizing your character, you enter the game where everyone is a suspect. The murder has occurred and whoever did it is nicely camouflaged within the party crowd in the house. However, the time is crucial as you have limited time 2 hours or so to solve the mystery and make an arrest. With skills at your disposal, you will be able to take fingerprints from almost anything, write in your detective notebook about conversations you find intriguing, and slowly but surely, outlining your suspect. Alas, many love affairs, plots, intrigues and what all not among other characters may be uncovered in your investigations, but that mustn't cloud your judgment for why you are here, to solve the Murder!
