 Brataccas is one of the very first Atari ST and Amiga games ever produced. Controlled using the mouse, it combines exploration, puzzle-solving and combat.  You play a character named Kyne, a man who has a price on his head. You must search the mining asteroid, Brattacus, to gather proof of a government plot against you and to try to stay alive. Surveillance cameras are watching you, so take any chance to disable them.  Brataccas is a place where greed and corruption rule the day.  The residents are treacherous, and while they can be bribed they are not above murder, so be careful out there.
