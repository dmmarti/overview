 Create your own graphic adventures! Adventure Construction Set allows the player to customize a tile-set, maps, and objects to create in-depth adventures, reminiscent of the early Ultima games. Seven small 'toolkits' to build from: Sci/Fi, Spy, and Medieval setting templates, plus two complete games are included as a demonstration:  Rivers of Light is based on Sumeric mythology and contains 140 rooms and Land of Aventuria consists of seven mini adventures with different settings, e.g. an adaption of Alice in Wonderland or a Nazi castle.
