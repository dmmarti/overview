 Written by Jim Walls, Codename: ICEMAN was to be the first game in a new adventure game series by Sierra. A sequel was never released, although it was mentioned in Sierra's news magazine. You control Navy officer Johnny Westland, as he takes on a secret mission dealing with the oil reserves in Tunisia. The game is a traditional adventure, with interesting James Bond-esque spy elements. A large portion of the game is also played in a perhaps overly complex for some players submarine simulator.
