 You've got an Sword and a Galleon, that's about it really. You sail around picking fights with other galleons and taking their riches until you're rich and powerful yourself. Eventually you have to save the Queen from the clutches of the evil Varisco, but the gameplay is surprisingly similar to Sid Meier's Pirates!.
