 On planet Agaris IV, two races fight for power on an endless war. When the Klutes and the Furfurians' dispute made their planet inhospitable, they needed a new battleground. Their troops where teleported to planet Earth, where everything, they discover, is 100 times bigger. Their battles are thus a small event there, taking place out of the attention of the humans.  Tiny Troops is a real-time strategy game, with gameplay similar to Cannon Fodder. It supports up to 2 players in split-screen mode, and mouse or joystick control. Before starting a level, a screen is shown where the player must select which units are going to be on his troop. There's several types of units foot soldiers, grenadiers, etc. Clicking the general gives a hint and the main objective of the level that usually is about killing the enemy and destroying their base. Most of the main game screen is occupied by a scrolling map of the level, with the bottom portion reserved for the control windows one for the mini-map, other for game options like saving and restarting, a third for unit commands and a final one with unit information or a list of group formations. The player controls the soldiers by clicking on them and selecting orders icons from the command window:  - a fist icon is to attack;  - an upward arrow to select the route;  - a wrench to repair things;  - a shield to stand guard;  - a target to surround the unit.  The game has 65 levels spread on a variety of different terrains garden, kitchen, etc.
