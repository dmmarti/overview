 This side-view shoot ﾑem up scrolls in multiple directions, moving it away from the R-Type game style and more towards Blood Money. Most of the danger comes from wall mountings or static obstacles rather than actual sentient opposition. The levels are large and multi-directional, with a map feature to help you progress through each one. Power up weapons can be collected. The gameplay is quite systematic, with a measured approach working better than a gung-ho ﾑshoot first, ask questions later' mentality.
