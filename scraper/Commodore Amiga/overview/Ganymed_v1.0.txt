not another Empire Strikes Back ripoff. You remember the bit where the tiny Rebel fighters fly against the massive AT-AT walkers. Jeff Minter made a fortune out of a game called Attack of the Mutant Camels on the C64, and that was about a million times better as a game than this rather turgid attempt to rekindle an ancient idea. Sure, it's been written for the American market, and perhaps they don't mind this sort of rubbish, but in this country the competition is a little stiffer.

The screen is divided into thirds for the action, the scanner and the score. You fly your ship in a Defender style fashion from the right to the left and back again, trying to destroy the big walkers as they lumber from left to right. Apparently these are not products of the Imperial Empire, but spawn of the Tyran, and the little spaceship you control is said to be the property of someone called Lord Mantrex. Yes, there isn't much of a story to it, but there you go, there are fewer really cracking reasons to destroy lumbering great Deathbots these days.
