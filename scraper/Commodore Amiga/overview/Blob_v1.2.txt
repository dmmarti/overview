 This 3D puzzle game stars an amorphous blue creature, and presents you with a top-viewed world in which the character is closer to you when it's near the top of the level. A number of blocks are suspended in space, and you bounce around these trying to reach the exit, having first completed the level's objectives. These include painting certain blocks e la Q*Bert, collecting objects and rescuing other blobs by guiding them to the exit.   Additional types of block includes ones which shoot at you, cracked tiles which don't last long, sticky tiles you can't get much leverage from, and switches to make other blocks become visible or accessible. The 3D is an integral aspect of the game, with falling off ledges into oblivion causing the loss of a life.
