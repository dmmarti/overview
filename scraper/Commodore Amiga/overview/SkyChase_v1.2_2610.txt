 Take to the skies and fight your opponent computer or human on a split screen or null-modem link.  Takeoffs and landings are handled automatically, so players can focus on shooting each other down. Flyby replays are featured for crashes, so you can gloat over each victory. In one-player mode, the view from your opponent's plane is optional; either way you have a scanner to help locate them. Different levels of ammunition and missile stock can be set, to make for a variety of gameplay options. After the game has been ran for 3 hours, a hidden 'paper plane' mode is added, alongside a roster of topline machines such as the F-16 and MiG-29.
