 This game is based on the long-running British satirical television show with puppet likenesses of political figures and celebrities.  A prophet determines that a world war will occur in seven years instigated by a mysterious leader.  To avoid this, one ruler of the world must be determined in this beat 'em up involving six rulers: U.S.A.'s Ronald Regan, the U.K.'s Margaret Thatcher, the USSR's Mikhail Gorbachev, South Africa's PW Botha, Iran's Ayathollah Khomeini, and Pope John Paul II.  Having chosen which to play as, you travel to an opponent's country to engage in a best-of-three fight that is judged by Queen Elizabeth II on a postage stamp.  You attack each opponent on the ground as well as jumping in the air and each character has a special move like Thatcher's head-butt or Khomeini's beard whip.  You can also call for help twice from an aide who will usually throw a projectile at your opponent.    If you manage to defeat all 5 opponents, you will meet the mysterious leader in a final showdown in a mud-wrestling pit in the dark where you will only be able to see the eyes of the characters.  You can also play 2-player fights, one against another on the same computer.
