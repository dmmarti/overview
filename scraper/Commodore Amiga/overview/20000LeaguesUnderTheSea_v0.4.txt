 The game is based on an idea by Jules Verne.  In 5th July 1867 the government has decided on the departure of the famous ship the Abraham Lincoln, which will leave on the trail of the sea monster. The great French professor Mr. Arronax will also take part in the expedition. The weeks passed without any sign of the monster's presence in the area, when, one day, 300 miles from the shores of Queen Charlotte's Island... three members of the expedition will set on board the Nautilus, submarine navigated by Captain Nemo. The player takes the Anorax' role to find out more.  The most part of the game is spent on the Nautilus which consists of three rooms: the living room, the control room and the library. There the player can manipulate objects and talk to people to receive hints what to do next and the state of the Nautilus. With the map he influences the route. Sometimes the player leaves the submarine to explore other locations respectively solves puzzles to receive more hints or to solve action sequences, e.g. fighting against a shark.   The game is played in real-time which means the key to success is being at the right location in the right time. This also results in various possibilities to render the game unwinnable and regular waiting times. The player also needs to watch Nemo's mood, if he angers Nemo, e.g. by manipulating the ship instruments, he locks the player into his room and valuable time passes. The game is played completely in point and click and has no function to save progress.
