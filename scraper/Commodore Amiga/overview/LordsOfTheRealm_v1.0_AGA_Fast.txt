 The English throne lies empty in 1268 A.D.  You and 5 lords are locked in a struggle for the crown.  Reap the benefits of successful feudal governing, castle-building, castle-sieging, and land battle to conquer your rivals and claim the kingdom.  You must keep your serfs fed and happy.  Then assign them to farming, herding, building, military and other tasks.  Design your own castles or build them using actual historical blueprints.  Then lay siege to your neighbors' castles and fight out land battles in tactical detail.
