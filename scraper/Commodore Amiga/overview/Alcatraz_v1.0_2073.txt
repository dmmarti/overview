 As a U.S. Navy SEAL you must break into Alcatraz prison and free all of the hostages. Alcatraz is a one or two player platform game that changes perspective to a first-person view once you're inside a building. With many different weapons such as flamethrowers, machine guns, bombs, and other destructive, close combat weapons, you will be able to defeat the wild horde of terrorists. If you play with the two player option, the screen splits horizontally.
