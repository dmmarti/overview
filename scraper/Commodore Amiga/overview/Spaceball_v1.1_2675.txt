Spaceball is a basic Pong variant. The plot is set in 2164 and the planet Utalis was conquered by the Jitter-Bobs. Their only chance for freedom is to beat the invaders in a Spaceball competition.

The utilities consist of two paddles which are positioned on the left and right side of the screen; either one or both controlled by human players. Both participants try to hold a ball on the playfield by bouncing it back with their paddle. If a player lets the ball exit, the other receives points. Sometimes objects or yellow balls appear on the playfield: the former cause the ball's direction to change and the latter causes certain effects on the paddle which touched the ball last, e.g. a smaller, faster, bigger or disappearing paddle.
