Edd the Duck 2: Back with a Quack! is a Wild West-themed side-scrolling platformer game featuring Edd the Duck, a puppet featured on BBC television in the late 1980s and early 1990s. Edd's main weapon is a supply of custard pies that can be throw horizontally for a short distance, which will temporarily stun enemies if they are hit in the face. The terrain includes barrels, train carriages, sparking electrical pylons, saloons and gold mines.
