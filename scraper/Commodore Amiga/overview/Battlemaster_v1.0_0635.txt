An early squad based combat strategy game set in a medieval style fantasy world.

The player decides which race they want to play (Human, Orc, Dwarf or Elf) each with their own strengths and weaknesses. It is then a matter of clearing out areas of opponents and finding items to enhance your character's and companions abilities.

There are many traps to avoid and death is a constant in what most people would find a very tough game.

The nearest game to compare it to would be Rage Of Mages, though that has more of an RPG/RTT (real-time tactics) focus as opposed to "squad action", but it does bear aesthetic similarities and a squad based fantasy fighting theme.

Gameplay for leader is action-oriented, with a menu that allows to Parley/Travel/Rally Troops, change formations or use items. The leader attacks with Melee and Projectile buttons. Some classes are more reliant on teammates than others. "Parley" allows you to buy (but not sell) items, or buy a Safe Pass (skip the area)
