 You're the famous square-jawed detective in this graphic adventure.  Track down criminals and solve cases using your two-way wrist radio, squad car, and bugs you plant in the bad guys' hideouts.  Suspects behave differently depending on their personality: Some will cooperate, while others will interpret a show of force as an invitation to a gun battle.  Features characters from the comic series.
