Swooper is a space shooter. The player has to transport a vaccine from Earth to a space station in which an epidemic has broken out. Unfortunately some aliens have something against this. The game is divided into two parts: during the first, the player is restricted to the bottom of the screen and has to shoot all alien ships which appear at the upper part. Alien shots are dodged by moving left or right. During the second part, the player has to survive a meteorite field. The player can change the speed of the ship - the faster, the more points are earned. While dodging, there are also astronauts to pick up which reward bonus points.
