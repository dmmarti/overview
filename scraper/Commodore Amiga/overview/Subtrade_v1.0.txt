 Subtrade: Return to Irata is Dan Bunten's classic M.U.L.E. revamped for VGA and set underwater.  Presentation aside, the game preserves the graceful game mechanics and the multiplayer addictiveness of its model, with four players competing for economic dominance in a round-based closed market scenario. True to the setting, players grow fish and hoard pearls and take domesticated turtles by the leash to their seafloor farmlands.  In finest M.U.L.E. tradition, Subtrade is best when played with four human players, though uniform AI replacements make for a moderate challenge. Each game ends after one year, i.e. twelve rounds, with the wealthiest player winning.
