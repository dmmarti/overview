 Similarities with the other Mr. Nutz game only go as far as the title and main character, although both are side-scrolling platform games. Mr. Nutz the squirrel is holidaying on Peanut Planet when he's called into action to save the local people from a race of chickens. Nutz can fly, swim and dive through the planet on his quest. The level layouts include tunnels and warp zones. Bonus items and additional weapons including bombs are available along the way.
