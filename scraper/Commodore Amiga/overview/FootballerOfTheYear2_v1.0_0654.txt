 Fed up with football soccer management games, with all the match strategies, financial turmoil and prima donna players? This game offers a unique twist, leaving you 'managing' the career of a single player, involving matches and transfers.  You start with 10 'goal cards' - up to 3 can be played in each match, each of them giving you a shooting chance, at which point arcade action skill comes in. The better you perform, the higher your wages are, the more chance you have of a big-money transfer and international call-up, and the less chance you have of being dropped from the team.  There's also a trivia section, which asks increasingly difficult questions allowing you to go double or nothing on knowing the answers - up to ﾣ8000 a time can be won on this.
