 Morgoth has taken over the world, and it is the player's task to defeat him.  In this unique first-person view RPG, the player's character plus six companions will have to find four crystals and place them on four towers to be able to fight Morgoth.  The game is a predecessor to the Ishar games, with most of the characters from your party showing up in later games.
