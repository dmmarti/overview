 This multi-section space-based game was coded by Reflections, the team behind Shadow of the Beast. The plot involves an attempt to get across a harsh galaxy despite not having the funds or firepower to make it.   To reach each planet the player has to progress through numerous action sections, starting with some overhead-view shooting of rocks which break into progressively smaller blocks, a scanner tells the player roughly where they are located. This is followed by an into the screen shoot-out against an enemy flying backwards and forwards, and then the final approach to the trading centre, which involves the player progressing on foot from an overhead view, and sees contact with the enemies lose time rather than energy  the player has 3 attempts to get there in time.  Once the player reaches the planet, a trading aspect comes into play. Strategic purchase of the right equipment to boost the ship, as well as extra shields and firepower which can be balanced depending on the next level.
