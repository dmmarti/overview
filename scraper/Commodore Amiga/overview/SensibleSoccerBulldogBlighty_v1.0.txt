This disk from Amiga Power magazine contains playable demo versions of Flair's Trolls and Psygnosis' Combat Air Patrol, but the item of most interest is the exclusive game Sensible Soccer Meets Bulldog Blighty - partly as a demo of the 92-93 edition, and also for something different.

England V Germany is on offer, with 3 modes of play - 1944, 1966 and 1993. The latter two are easy to explain - 1993 is a playable demo to show off the improvements to the second version, and 1966 involves playing the World Cup Final teams, in black and white (a hidden option which exists in the Custom Teams of the full game).

1944, though, involves the ball being replaced with a bomb, which can bounce awkwardly and obviously prevents heading. At random intervals it will start to glow, meaning that it's about to explode. Any players near the ball are then removed from play, and the last team to touch it get a free kick or penalty as appropriate.
