Nucleus is a two dimensional side-scrolling sci-fi shoot'em up with slow-paced action. The player controls a space ship and must destroy the electric core of a synthetic planet called Cetorium to defeat a dangerous alien race. He flies left to right and collects bonuses and power ups to increase the ship's firepower. Extra weapons look like the levitating options from Gradius,but there are several types. Various enemies have to be shot and at the end of levels there are fights against large bosses. The game has a specific organic/plant style with resemblance to X Multiply. Most of the enemies aren't space ships but rather bugs and bacteria-like creatures. Also the game's environments look organic. The game has one-hit-death and the player has only a few ships to use. There are six stages.
