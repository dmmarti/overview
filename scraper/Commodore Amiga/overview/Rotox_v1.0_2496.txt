 In this 3D Rotoscoped landscape the player controls Rotox the robot, which is required to to eradicate any form of mechanized existence on each of the levels. Each level is comprised of nine sectors, which are not all linked together. At the beginning of each level you drop in from above and get a general overview of the level.   Planning a path from sector to sector often involves using moving pathways. The sectors are heavily defended, but weapons can be picked up throughout. When a sector is cleared of robots, the screen flashes and the player is free to move on to the next sector.
