 This action / adventure game is adapted from the Italian comic book Ranx e New-York by Stefano Tamburini and Tanino Liberatore. You're Ranx, a cyborg in a Cyberpunk-style world. A lethal virus is spreading, and the President has caught it, so you must go to New York with the antidote to save him. After this, you must rescue your girlfriend in Rome.   You will fight with ninjas, gays, Chinese and others, using your kicks and punches. You can pick up items including pieces for later repairs and items which can be sold when you talk to other characters. Destroy street lamps to get money, but make sure the police don't see you. Enjoy the violence!
