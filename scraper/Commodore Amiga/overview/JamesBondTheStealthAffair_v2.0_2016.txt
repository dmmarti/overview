 This game is a graphic adventure game with a point-and-click interface.  My profession? I work in... well... the information business. Oh no, spy is such an ugly word. I prefer the term special agent. No, I cannot talk about my mission, for obvious reasons. Only so much: You probably heard of the disappearance of the high-tech stealth plane. I thought so. To imagine that it might have fallen in the wrong hands... Whom I have in mind? Well, terrorists, for example. Yes, huge, secret terrorist organizations plotting crimes on a global scale. You know, the kind of totalitarian gang which is led by a mad, thoroughly evil genius from his giant underground base. Don't worry, the CIA is already searching for the plane. Yes, I'm certain. If you would please excuse me now, my plane is about to depart. Oh, just to a beautiful, jungle-island banana republic. Holiday? I don't think so...  The game is controlled by the same pop-up command menu consisting of six verbs that was introduced in Delphine's debut Future Wars. However, it's been slightly improved and does now allow interaction with your inventory, like examining and combining items. You get to toy around with a whole load of typical special agent's gadgets, beginning with a passport forgery kit and ending with explosive cigarettes. Apart from solving puzzles, you've got to make it through some arcade sequences: escape the labyrinth, dive with limited breath, dodge the evil guy's minions. Although not as frequent as in Future Wars, pixel hunting and the occasional dead-end are still annoying features in The Stealth Affair.
