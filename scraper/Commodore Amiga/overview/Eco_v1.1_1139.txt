 Eco is an action strategy game of sorts, which sets you in charge initially of a small single-celled organism, and challenges you to guide its evolution. Your initial tasks are to roam around finding food, and then find a potential mate. Depending on your organism's status, different predators will be after you - a radar is displayed to indicate where these are at any given time. Once this is done, you are taken to a screen displaying the species' genes, and you have the chance to modify one of them, thus resulting in evolution. Eventually you can evolve far enough to become plant, insect, fish or even human.
