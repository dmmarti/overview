 A multi-directionally scrolling top down shoot 'em up set across 10 levels, each representing a planet whose eco-system has been infected. The controls involved thrusting and rotating, similarly to Asteroids.  There are two ways to successfully complete the level - destroy enough of the infection to allow the planet to survive, or rescue enough of the citizens, Defender-style. For each of the organs to be destroyed, a specific weapon can be created to cleanse it easier - blueprints must be collected and taken back to your ship for this. Gameplay isn't totally smooth on 68000 Amigas, but it runs perfectly from the box on even the most souped-up Amiga.
