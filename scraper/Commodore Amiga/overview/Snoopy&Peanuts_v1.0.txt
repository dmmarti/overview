A simple adventure game for young players where you play Snoopy as the main character solving various puzzles in the area.

The basic idea is manipulating objects by picking them up and dropping them at certain areas, which will result in a new sequence to the plot.

You can use either a keyboard or joystick to play the game and there are only 5 actions you can perform: Move left, Move right, Jump, Pickup/Drop and Object Information.
