 Apocalypse was three years in the making, and had three different programming teams involved in its development at different stages. In its simplest essence it's a helicopter-based shoot 'em up inspired by Choplifter. You must enter the jungle fortress of an evil dictator and take out his forces single-handedly. Also rescue as many POWs as possible. The levels scroll horizontally, and feature 32-colour multi-level parallax graphics. Enemies include tanks, helicopters, watch-tower patrols and howitzers.
