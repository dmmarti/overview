 In the game you are a small shaggy blue demon found himself in the dungeon full of fallen angels, gargoyles, wasps, etc. Walking through them you lose your energy, which is your life. So you have to run and jump avoiding them, collecting gems, blood drops, energy vials, and some sort of your friend-demons such as eyes and tongues. On each level you have to find the keys to open door to magical cauldron guarded by beautiful elf. Levels are decorated with statues of beautiful women, old men, dragons, swords, or eye walls.
