 After the Cariken family became complacent, the land of Gaspar ceased to be ruled as well. This left the way clear for evil men such as  Maldur the druid to step in and slaughter the family, shattering their magical amulet. By computer game plot standards he did a good job - only one of the family survived, and the amulet was broken into 23 pieces.   As Ulopa, the sole survivor, you must reclaim the pieces. They are spread across 23 levels of platforming action, combining the surface with some underground tunnels. The levels are of course packed with monsters. You have 3 types of weapons with different functionality; switching between them at the right moments is vital. You can also collect upgrades from the carcasses of dead enemies. Other upgrades such as springs and a parachute can also be found.
