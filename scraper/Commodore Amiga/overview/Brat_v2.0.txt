 In Brat you must guide a baby, Nathan, through levels with features such as dynamite, bridges and holes. You do this indirectly, by specifying which direction he goes in, in a manner vaguely similar to Lemmings. You also tell him when to use objects in a simplistic manner similar to the Dizzy games.  The game combines reactions and planning in quite an original way. The character himself isn't at all cutesy, as the title implies, and that may affect your perception of the game.
