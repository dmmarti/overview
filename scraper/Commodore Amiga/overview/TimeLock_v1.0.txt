Time Lock is a typical falling block puzzle game. An array of three blocks, arranged diagonally, fall from the top of the screen and the layer can move if left and right until it reaches the ground. Those blocks are of different forms and their order can be changed during the fall (1-2-3 becomes 2-3-1 and so on). The goal is to bring three or more identical blocks together (horizontally, vertically or diagonally), then they vaporize and reward points. There are also a few extra blocks and five difficulty levels. The game is over when the blocks reach the top of the screen. The player can choose between five block themes: Chinese letters, fruits, computer parts, traffic signs or gems
