 This platform game bares a similarity to Bubble Bobble in many ways. There are 100 single screen levels, featuring variously shaped ledges, for the two characters to face before escaping from the Tower of Time.  These levels are laden with nasty bugs, but you have a methane gun to shoot at them. This absorbs them, and allows them to be fired out against a wall; if they don't reach the wall, they live to fight another day. You must destroy them all within a specific time limit to progress.
