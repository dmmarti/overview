Populous II continues the "god game" genre pioneered by Bullfrog's classic Populous. In PII, you're an unproven immortal who must fight your way through an entire pantheon of Greek gods, each with his or her own strategy and attacks, and ultimately enter into a showdown with Zeus himself.

The gameplay mechanics are similar to Populous, but PII features a wider array of spells, digitized sound, and high-resolution graphics to give the spell effects extra punch. Multiplayer is supported via serial link and dial-up.

Populous II: The Challenge Games is an add-on for Populous II: Trials Of The Olympian Gods that replaces its setting with ancient Japan. Apart from the new 500 worlds to conquer there is a new game mode: 42 puzzle-like worlds challenging you to save your people from impending cataclysms before time runs out.
