Matrix Marauders is a racing game set in the future. The player takes part in the ultimate racing championship and, well, races against other cars and tries to be the first at the goal. All cars are equipped with weapons which can be used to destroy the opposition. Other things to keep in mind are holes on the track which need to be jumped over and power ups which offer advantages when picked up, e.g. more speed. Permission to start at the next race is only given if the player finishes the race among the first three. Between races the car and its weapon system can be upgraded.
