P.O.D. provides the gameplay for this top-view budget shooter with 25 levels, challenging you to survive until the time runs out. You start with three lives, but get an extra one (up to a maximum of five) when a level is completed. The time goal is not reset when you lose a life.

You guide a small spacecraft around a screen representing your people's power grid, moving it in the four compass directions along the grid lines. Aliens fire in all directions, so there are no 'safe spots' in which you will not get hit. Their shots cut lines out of the grid, preventing motion along that space for the few seconds it takes to reform. Every fourth level deviates from the norm by simply forcing you to shoot aliens for bonus points. Lives can still be lost during and gained after these.
