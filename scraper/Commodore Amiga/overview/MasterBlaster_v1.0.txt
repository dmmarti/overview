You are the pilot of a Federation Clearance Ship and it's your job to make sure the Space Lanes between Pluto and Mercury are clear from asteroids (reduced in size when shot), alien ships and shooting stars. You must clear three sectors for each planet in the Solar System before attempting to dock with the Factory Ship. The game is viewed from above your ship with the whole sector shown on screen. You can turn your ship left and right as well as thrust forward and you must shoot anything that moves on the screen. Once a sector is cleared you must enter a gate to move to the next one.

If you are touched by any object then you lose one of five lives but your ship does have a limited shield which is seen on a gauge and when it is empty then you lose this option for the rest of the game. Smart-bombs will destroy all on the screen but is limited as well but you can hyperspace to another part of the screen as many times as you like. Once three sectors have been cleared then you dock with the Factory Ship which sits at the top of the screen with a gap moving left or right. Get through the gap without touching the ship and you have docked and can move to the next planet.

Master Blaster is based on the arcade game Asteroids and you use the keyboard to control your ship
