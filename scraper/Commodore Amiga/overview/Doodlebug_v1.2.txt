 Side-scrolling platform in a very colourful cartoony style. Your aim as the Doodlebug is to make your way through five different levels with three sub-levels each, killing baddies by jumping on their heads until you eventually make it to the final baddie.  The most unique thing about this game is the novel theme at its centre: You can choose between five different coloured pencils to throw at your baddies presuming you've picked some up. If the pencil's flight path is uninterrupted then they'll draw a useful item for you: Either an Umbrella for long falls, Ball to be able to jump onto higher platforms, a Potion invincibility, a Clock stops time and an Eraser kills everything on screen.
