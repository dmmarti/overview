 Ocean's second Wrestling game is tag-team-based, taking you through four fights around major European cities. You assemble your 2-man team from Hulk Hogan, The Ultimate Warrior, Brett 'Hitman' Hart and Macho Man Randy Savage.  Combat takes place both in and out of the ring, although you can't spend more than 10 seconds at a time outside the ring. Once you stun an opponent you can throw them, which inflicts real damage to their energy bar. You can make lots of combination moves, including jumping off the ropes and landing on an opponent to pin him.
