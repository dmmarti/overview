 The Norse Kingdom is threatened by the Iniquitous Hel, goddess of Niflheim and purveyor of evil. Thor, the great god of law and order, has been selected by his fellow gods to travel through four Norse worlds in an attempt to stop Hel spreading evil and ruling his people. The journey will be long and ardulous. Hel has sent creatures to meet Thor, delay his progress, and kill him. A variety of pitfalls and traps await him.  To travel between worlds, Thor must collect the four segments of a key that will unlock the exit door. One segment lies inside a building, the rest are outdoors. If he fails to find all segments of the key when he gets to the exit door, then he goes back to the start of the world to search for what segments that he has missed.  Hel's creatures will try to stop him from doing this, but he can deal with them using a variety of weapons, such as fireballs and axes, and he can carry two weapons simultaneously, and can switch between them at any time. Potions can be obtained by destroying the flying creatures that go back and forth each screen. At the end of each world, Thor must defeat a much bigger creature in order to get to the exit door.
