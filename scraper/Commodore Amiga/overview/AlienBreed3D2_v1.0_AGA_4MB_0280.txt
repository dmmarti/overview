 Team 17's last ever Amiga release moved beyond the original wave of Doom-influenced Amiga games, providing full screen graphics with no loss of detail. Players have 16 levels to progress through in one-player mode, complete with all manner of nasties. A level editor is provided, which is especially useful for the 2-player game. The game is extremely challenging, but not likely to be completed quickly. The AI is quite advanced, with aliens working together and trying to adjust their approach depending on which of the many weapons you are armed with.
