 A platform game resembling Mario and Wonderboy quite strongly. Kid must rescue the woman he loves by crossing 6 worlds, each split into 4 levels. There are a range of baddies to beat, following pre-set attack patterns or just staying on the spot, to be killed using your sword.  Once killed most release things like tokens, keys sometimes required to open end-of-level doors, apples for extra energy and occasionally poison. There are lots of semi-hidden sections and bonus areas to find and explore, including bonus arcade games and fruit machines. Every world ends with a boss.
