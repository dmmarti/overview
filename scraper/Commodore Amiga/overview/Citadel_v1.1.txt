 A revolt on a distant prison island must be foiled by you in this first-person shoot ï¾‘em up. Reaching the control room will suffice, but a further challenge of finding the six pieces of a hidden bomb can be undertaken if you're brave.  The game features texture-mapped visuals and a variable screen size, making it suited to anything from a humble A500 most Doom-style games needed at least an A1200 or a well-accelerated machine.  The prison complex is on several levels, with teleporters linking different sections, and the chance to reach the final control room via several different paths. You don't get a weapon at the start of the game, and ammunition is in shorter supply than usual, meaning that you can't just shoot randomly and hope for the best. Another way of killing people off is to set them on fire
