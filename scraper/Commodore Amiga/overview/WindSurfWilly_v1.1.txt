 Windsurf Willy offers 1 or 2 player windsurfing action at 3 different skill levels. You're the contestant in 15 different locations, in which you must show 4 judges your skills, from speed to trick-surfing as you ride those waves. Points are awarded based how artistic the technique was. Judging the flow of the waves, and avoiding wreckage and other hazards, is crucial to maximising the score.
