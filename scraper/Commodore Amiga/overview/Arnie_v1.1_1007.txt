 A succession of terrorists must be wiped out to keep the planet safe. That job falls to Arnie, a big musclebound hero of Germanic origin.  The game's levels each scroll horizontally, as opposed to the isometric view used in the sequel. They see you trying to find positions to attack the minions, before finally reaching the end of level targets.
