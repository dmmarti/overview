 Despite the fact that its one-button joystick standard, disk-based loading, and an audience generally more intrigued by original surprise-laden games, made the Amiga theoretically unsuitable for beat 'em ups, a fair number were released during the Mortal Kombat / Street Fighter 2 era, although this was one of the few AGA-based ones.   We're going down in the tube station at midnight for the series of fights in the game, hence the title and background graphics. As in Rise of the Robots, you always play the same character in one-player mode, and in a break from tradition he a definite human, presumably making the game even less appealing to a female audience seeking to identify is on the right of the screen at the start although, unlike Rise, you can jump over your opponent- hooray!.   A limited range of attacking moves are on offer, none of which are beyond the realms of what ordinary humans can do, gives the game a martial-arts feel more akin to the older beat 'em ups, and removes the need for complex control moves. The game has both sound effects and music, although you can't choose between them, or access the options after starting your first fight, short of rebooting.
