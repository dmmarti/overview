 Future Wars is a graphic adventure game, the first to use Delphine's proprietary Cinematique point-and-click interface. A right click brings up the verb menu. After choosing one of the six commands, you point the mouse over the desired target and execute with a left click. Small objects are depicted by enlarged drawings - once you found them. Pixel hunting is a very frequent aspect of Future Wars. Lazy players are punished with puzzle dead-ends.  What an unlikely hero! You are a window cleaner. A common, little window cleaner. Yet you discover, more due to your notorious curiosity than by mistake, a time machine in your chiefs back office. Strange? Absolutely. Your adventure in the past and the future is about to begin. The quest? Four words: Evil aliens. Beautiful girl.
