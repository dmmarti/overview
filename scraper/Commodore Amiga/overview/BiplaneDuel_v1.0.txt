A two-player competitive game, where each player controls a biplane and tries to shoot down their opponent. The player who shoots down their opponent the most within a fixed time period is the winner.

At the start of each game, each player's biplane (one white, one black) starts in one of the corners at the bottom of the screen, facing towards the center. They then need to take off before reaching a small dividing wall at the bottom of the screen. Once airborne, they can shoot small missiles at their opponents. These missiles will travel in a straight line, but only a fraction of the screen width before exploding, and only one per player can be fired at a time. If either player reaches the edge of the screen, then they will be hit by "anti-aircraft fire" which is displayed as a wall of small sparkling explosions. If a player is hit (either by crashing into the ground, wall, anti-aircraft fire or by an opponent's missile), then their opponent's score is incremented, and they are returned to their corner of the screen to try again. There is a warning that the game is about to end when the scores start to flash.

Control of the biplane is accomplished using two up/down levers. The first affects the plane's speed, while the second affects its pitch. One of the levers has a button on top, which may be used to fire at their opponent.
