 Reflexity Pinball Challenge is a German pinball game. It has support to four players and features three tables with an Alien-inspired theme. There's a multiball feature: an U-shaped magnet on the tables holds up to three balls and releases them when a fourth touches the third. Each player starts with four balls. The player switches tables by hitting the teleporter with the ball. The teleporter area opens when a certain amount of points is reached 150,000 points for the second table, and 600,000 points for the third. A bonus table with a timer appears after teleporting.
