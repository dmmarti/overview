 Red Baron puts you in the pilot's seat of actual World War I fighter aircraft. This game features 28 different aircraft from both the Allied and the German sides presented in actual 3D graphics. Start a career as a pilot and rise through the ranks to become the most feared ace in the skies, or participate in a variety of single missions including simple fighter sweeps, balloon-busting, zeppelin hunting, or take on an actual WWI ace in one-on-one combat. If you're good enough, you may even be able to take on the infamous Manfred von Richtofen, the Red Baron himself.
