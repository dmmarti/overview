 Loosely based around the Gibson Games board-game, you are in control of a team of 4 POWs  a Brit, a Frenchman, an American and a Pole and must guide them all to what many attempted and few achieved  escape from the notorious Nazi POW camp. You control each of the 4 men separately, each of them starting within their own quarters on different floors of the camp, and can always switch between them.   The gameplay has a similar feel to isometric-view Spectrum games, notably The Great Escape and Head Over Heels. Collecting and using objects is a significant part of your task  lock-picks for the low-security doors, keys for the more secure ones, German uniforms to allow you to move around freely, and shovels to dig for freedom. You must avoid entering forbidden areas  do this and you will be placed in solitary confinement and have your equipment confiscated  if you attempt to run from the guards in such areas they will shoot at you.
