 A third-person racing game featuring real Formula 1 cars and circuits, which represented Team 17's first attempt at the genre.  There are two gameplay modes, Arcade and Normal - in Arcade mode you have to finish in the top 3 each time, whereas in Normal mode you accumulate the appropriate points, irrespective of one or two bad results. There are 3 difficulty levels, and the number of laps is variable.  The field includes 22 cars you can choose between a Ferrari, Williams, McLaren and Benetton, and contact with these or with the kerbing or roadside barriers inflicts damage on your car. This may get bad enough that you have to pit for repairs if you don't make it to the pits and have more contact, you may get forced out altogether. Avoiding the slower cars you come up to lap can be crucial.
