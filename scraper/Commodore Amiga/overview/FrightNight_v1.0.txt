 Fright Night is based on the 1985 Columbia Pictures movie of the same name.  You play vampire Jerry Dandridge in this arcade style adventure game.  You prowl the rooms of the mansion searching for victims.  You have to dodge the Crucifixes thrown at you and sink your teeth into anything that looks tasty.  Once you've drained the blood of all your victims, you can proceed to the next level.  Keep an eye out for the unhealthy as they will drain your lifeforce; too much bad blood and you're a dead vampire.  You can run back to your coffin if you're low on health to regenerate, as well, you must be back in your coffin before the sun comes up, or you're a toasty vampire.
