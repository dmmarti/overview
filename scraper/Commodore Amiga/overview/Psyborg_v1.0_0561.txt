 You are a psyborg named Duncan Norton, who must travel through the vortex from a space vessel trapped in a galaxy very far from Earth. An alien race is threatening to take over 38 planets and you've got to stop them.   Starting from Anacreon, you will mentally pass through the Krypton, Kalgan, Zorgon, Terminus, Trantor, and finally Sol systems. Each stellar system has a certain number of planets, which you will traverse from one to another.   The game is a first-person virtual reality race, where you run as fast as possible on the tiles that are formed in a pentagonal prism. At the starting point you accelerate, and then change the facets of the prism in order to avoid falling through the gaps. When the tile's path  spirals, you may decelerate your velocity. Time runs out, and you must refill your time meter by standing on tiles marked with a T. Standing on certain tiles that are marked with shapes of different blinking colors will give you a different amount of points. Special actions, such as jumping from one part of prism to another as well as teleporting forward and back, may be performed. Save points are placed on the track but the number of prism facets may change during your run.  Finishing the race to each planet will give you a password, which may be used later to start from this point. The best scores will be written in High Scores table.  The game is available for 1 or 2 players.
