 You are Cecil Pitt, a wannabe rock star manager. You must choose from 1-4 rock stars with names such as Tina Turnoff and Wacko Jacko to manage by viewing their audition tapes. Once you chosen your artists you then have to choose what kind of gear to get them - spanking new, second hand or dodgy. The dodgy gear is dirt cheap but you might pay for your choice later on in the game.  To make your group a star, you have options such as practicing, publicity stunts, and buying gifts for your stars. Each action you choose advances the calendar by one day and you have until December to achieve your ultimate aim of superstardom - represented by a line graph which rises or falls depending on the performance of your band's releases.  Once your band has recorded their first album you can choose to release the single and/or the album. The single needs a video to go with it which costs varying amounts of cash depending on which director you choose. You can choose to go for publicity, but this can be risky as there is a chance that one of your rock stars will be in the papers as an ex-rock star who died in any of many strange ways all that's missing is a 'bizarre gardening accident'. Publicity affects your sales directly and also affects the crowds who attend your gigs. You lose the game if either you run out of money, or all of your rock stars die.
