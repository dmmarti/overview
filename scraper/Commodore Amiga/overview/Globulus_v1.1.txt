In Globulus, the player takes the role of Globby, a alien who is on a dangerous journey. This is an action game with puzzle elements. Every of the 25 levels consists of tiles which are built like a mountain and the goal is to reach the bottom. It is important to think before jumping because the tiles have different abilities, e.g. spikes result in instant death or others cause an automatic movement from the player character.

Another problem is that Globby can only move downwards, but by pressing a button the player can flip around the level. This means the biggest part of the game consists of thinking about what path to take. There are various enemies crawling around the level which can be killed by using dynamite (also used to blow up barriers) or smart bombs. Those can be gained by stepping on certain tiles or by buying them between levels with earned points. Every level has a time limit of 15 minutes.
