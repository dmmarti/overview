 The heroes from Pool of Radiance and Curse of the Azure Bonds return once again.  This time, they arrive naked via a magical well inside a frozen town wishing for heroes to help them.  The party once again attempts to save a town under siege once re-equipped and struggles to learn the secret of the Silver Blades...  The gameplay is quite similar to that of the previous Gold Box games. Following the  ADandD rules of role-playing, the player creates a party of characters up to the maximum of six. Exploration takes place in pseudo-3D environments, from first-person view. Battles random as well as pre-set take the player-controlled and enemy party to a top-down battle screen. Commands are issued in turn-based fashion, and the player-controlled characters can freely navigate the battle field. Unlike the previous games, there is no andquot;world mapandquot; traveling in Secret of the Silver Blades. All the exploration takes place in the 3D world.
