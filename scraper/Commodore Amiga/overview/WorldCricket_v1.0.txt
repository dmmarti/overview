Time to take to the field and manage a cricket team. This one-player game allows you to choose your team from seven countries and play versus the other ones. You can choose from three lengths of tour (home and abroad). These tours include one-day, three-day and a full blown test match.

The game is a standard managerial game with icons on the menu screen to allow you to manage your team. When you play a match a scoreboard appears with the runs totting up. Occasionally the game will show a highlight of a decisive moment. This is a side view, first showing the bowler then the batsman. Here the ball can hit the wicket. If the batsman hits the ball then it either shows a catch or a six.

During the game if you are batting you can choose the next batsman when a wicket has fallen or if you are bowling then when things need changing you can change bowler.
