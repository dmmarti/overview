 A follow-up to the first Spy vs Spy game now sees the spies stranded on a desert island. This time, instead of the four items which allow you to leave for the airport, the spies must try to collect 3 pieces of a missile.  There are new traps and a single gun to take part in combat, rather than the big sticks of the previous game.
