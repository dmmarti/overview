The crisis begun in the year 2110. An alien biological weapon, named „Armageddon“ by the priests, wiped out all but 2000 humans, farmers and prisoners hiding in Xerion, the golden city of the planet... Luckily that city also has an experimental plasma cannon, as an alien invasion is expected.

Missiles over Xerion is a Missile Command variation, in which the player has to defend the naming town. Released later in the Amigas lifetime, many options and convenience features, like an built-in trainer menu, are added to the aged original game, but without basically changing the gameplay itself.

You can equip Xerion, the town to defend, as far as you have earned the money for it. You can buy weapons, like nuclear or heavy metal missiles, different types of bombs or extend the buildings in the city like with increased energy storage, faster energy recharge, or faster shooting of the main cannon. The city is not divided in several individual buildings, but as a whole. Also, if there is enough energy, a shield is protecting the town. Different types of enemies are attacking in waves, some dropping bombs, some directly attacking the town themselves.

As a bonus, the game disk contains the Kingsoft game City Defense from 1987, another Missile Command game.
