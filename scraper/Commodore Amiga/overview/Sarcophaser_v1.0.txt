 This horizontally-scrolling shoot 'em up puts you in control of a Sarcophaser souped-up spaceship. Waves of enemies must be faced, including arrays of dots through which a path must be obtained. Most vanquished foes release tokens, which can be traded in for one of the 5 available enhancements, including double-fire, reverse fire and bombs. There is a guardian at the end of each level.
