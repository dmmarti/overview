 The world is in chaos, due to a computer system which was built to look after the world, but inevitably went wrong and started killing people. Only a few people remain, of which you are one, and your mission is to locate and destroy the Cybercon III computer.  The gameplay involves lots of exploration and puzzling, as you try to enter the complex and destroy or disable the hardware. Getting into the system is made easier by the presence of a secret entrance the computer doesn't know about. The computer has all manner of defences in place, which you can shoot out.
