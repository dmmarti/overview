 The New Worlds is a data disk add-on to the strategy game Utopia. It supplies ten new worlds to work through, each of which has a new alien race to encounter. These include the Sarturians, The Rako-Gorda, and a tribe of humans who had previously colonised. The planets themselves also vary in terms of areas to develop.
