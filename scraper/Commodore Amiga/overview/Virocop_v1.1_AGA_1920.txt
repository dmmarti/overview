 In Virocop you enter the Gamedisk, a virtual holiday theme park that is under the threat of destruction of viruses. Your job is to take control of a virocop, D.A.V.E. Digital Armoured Virus Exterminator and eliminate the enemies before it's too late. The levels are split into worlds with four levels each, and each world has its own theme. For example the first world is sport themed so you will drive over football fields, billiard tables and racing courses.   The gameplay is the one of an isometric shooter, where you roll around the levels and shoot the enemies with one of several weapons. The weapons covers the whole range from fast but not so powerful weapons to more powerful but slow like mortars. The action can be enjoyed by one or two players both turn-by-turn or simultaneous where one player controls movement and the other the weapons.
