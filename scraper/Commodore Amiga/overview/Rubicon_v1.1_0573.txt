 Rather tastelessly, the plot of this one concerns a catastrophic nuclear accident in Russia. You must trek through seven levels inhabited by mutated super-intelligent animals in order to diffuse each nuclear reactor.  Gameplay is a Gryzor style flip-screen run'n'gun shooter with occasional jetpack flights, with fairly unrelenting action. Power-ups are issued by a canister which you'll have to control in order to gain the weapon you want. The difficulty level is pitched high, as with Project X which was released at a similar time.
