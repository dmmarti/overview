 In the game the player took on the role of Christopher Columbus and the later Spanish conquistadors as you explored the New World or a randomly generated map. As you established forts and missions and brought back gold to Spain you would receive promotions from the Queen of Spain. The game featured a large world to explore and came up with some clever arcade sequences to simulate the interaction of the Natives and Spanish who did not speak the same language. The historical map accurately spreads out the Native population of the New World in 1492 and some historical situations can be simulated such as whether to get the gold of the Aztec and Incas by trade or conquest.
