Son Shu Shi is a game that nearly never was. Although released on the Atari ST, the Amiga version was previewed and reviewed in magazines but never appeared. The authors completed the Amiga version, but no longer have a copy of the source code or binary. However, a friend had still retained a working version.

The evil demon Taar-Ka has occupied the lovely kingdom of Tan Tao, which is why Son Shu-Shi is now allowed to act as a savior in the emergency. Technically very well balanced game, very colourful with beautiful background. The sound effects are clear and crisp and music is everywhere.

This is a brilliant platformer. Gameplay is no slouch and helps to make it thoroughly entertaining with fast and frantic playability. So beautiful and very addictive. Now I need “one more go”.
