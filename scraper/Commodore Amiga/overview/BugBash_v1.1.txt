 Bug Bash is a horizontally scrolling platform game where you are a ladybug. The location is your home, a garden that overnight has become very untidy. Around you swarms of insects and bugs are flying about mindlessly with no interest in helping you clear up the mess. They have been brain-washed by the Evil Slug. Now you must arm yourself with a insecticide spray gun and begin your quest of restore the garden to it's normal order.  The gameplay is quite simple. You simple pick up the trash and throw it into the trash can. At the same time you should stay clear  of the bugs or insects or you will lose energy which is equivalent to health in this game. The magic mushrooms that are in the game can be shot at to regain energy. There is also other pickups that will come in handy during the game. The game is divided into days and each days ends with a boss fight, i.e. an enormous frog.
