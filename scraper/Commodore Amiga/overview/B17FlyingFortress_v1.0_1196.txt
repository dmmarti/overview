 B-17 Flying Fortress is a simulation of the legendary heavy bomber of World War II.  After customizing one's bomber with nose art and a name, one of several randomly assigned bombing missions into Germany must be flown. The game not only features actual flight simulation, but also crew management. Each of the 10 crew members has ratings for categories like piloting, bombing and gunnery. During a mission, crew members can be reassigned to other posts if needed because of injuries. Each position including the pilot seat, the guns and the bombing sight can of course also be controlled by the player.   A historically accurate number of 25 missions must be flown and survived to complete a tour of duty.
