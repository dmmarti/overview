Like its predecessor, the game is an arcade beat'em up mixed with some adventure elements. The formula and the game mechanics have not changed, Garrison II mainly provides a set of (over 100) new levels and a new background story: The princess has fallen ill and five of her trusty servants are sent to gain a healing herb from a magician's tower.
