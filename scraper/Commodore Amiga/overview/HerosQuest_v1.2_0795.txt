 Do you want to be a hero? If so, then there is a good job waiting for you! Here is the little town of Spielburg, populated mostly by beer-drinking humans and some centaurs who like working in the field. Spielburg is surrounded by forests and mountains, where all kinds of weird creatures dwell: ogres, goblins, talking foxes, stupid magicians, and others. Lately, Spielburg has been assaulted by brigands; besides, the witch Baba Yaga is not to be trusted. The town has everything it needs, even a Thieves Guild, except a strong, brave hero that would protect it. Are you interested?  Hero's Quest: So You Want To Be A Hero is an adventure/RPG hybrid. Visually very similar to other Sierra's andquot;questandquot; titles Space Quest, Leisure Suit Larry, and others, but the gameplay, beside the usual exploration, conversations with characters, and solving an occasional puzzle, involves real-time combat and character development. You can play the game as either a fighter, a mage, or a thief. The choice of class will influence not only the combat, but also many other events in the game. You develop your skills by fighting, practicing, climbing, throwing, etc. Many of those activities are necessary to successfully complete the game. You interact with the game world by typing commands or conversation topics.
