Rock 'n Roll is a real-time puzzle game.

You know, there's this ball, and it's stuck in a labyrinth for no apparent reason. Never mind -- let's just help him out, okay? You control the friendly, spotted ball with the cursor keys. It'll gain speed as it goes, bounce off when it hits obstacles, loose energy when it's caught in traps, die when it falls off the platform. The 32 levels through which you've got to guide the ball are full of traps: laser barriers, ramps, tubes, breakable tiles etc. Colored keys will open doors, switches create (or destroy!) helpful items. These include picks to repair floor tiles, parachutes to prevent you from falling off and bombs to destroy walls. Items have to be bought with coins that are found all over the level. The inertia of the ball has a very realistic feel to it, making the control intuitive and relatively easy. Not so easy, however, is the design of the (huge) levels; to finish Rock 'n Roll, you need skill as well as patience. You got the balls?
