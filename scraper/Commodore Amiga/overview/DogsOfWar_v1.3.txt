 Dogs of War sets you as a freelance mercenary soldier available to take on a range of missions. These include rescuing kidnapped children, preventing terrorists from overthrowing a Government, and retrieving stolen oil paintings. The amount of money on offer for each mission depends on its difficulty.  Gameplay is influenced by Commando, with levels scrolling in a single direction at a time and featuring hordes of enemies moving towards you. Buildings and trees offer positions to hide behind, and occasionally launch safe attacks.   Before each mission you must buy your range of weapons and enough ammunition for them. These include pistols, machine guns, anti-tank devices and grenade launchers, each of which has its own strengths and weaknesses detailed.
