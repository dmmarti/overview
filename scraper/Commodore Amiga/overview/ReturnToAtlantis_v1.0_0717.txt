 Someone is trying to destroy the earth's oceans. As you are an expert on deep-sea diving and underwater combat, it's up to you to stop it. After planning your mission, choosing equipment and healing yourself from your Viceroy mobile base, you must dive into the oceans with your helpful robotic drone RUF and complete a series of 14 missions to save the world.    There are around 100,000 unique locations to be explored in this 3-D side scrolling game, which is a cross between arcade style action and a role playing game. There are lots of things to explore and experiment with as you travel back to Atlantis. You will meet and question many NPCs throughout the game - talk to them carefully and wisely to gleam key information.
