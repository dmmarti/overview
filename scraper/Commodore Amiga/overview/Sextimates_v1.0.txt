Sextimates is a pub trivia game for up to 4 players, with all questions revolving around the reproductive habits of humans, and more often about the sexual customs of Americans in the late eighties. Questions are available in 7 categories: Attraction, crime, health, lovemaking, parenting, relations and trivia. All questions may be answered in numbers, such as the number of minutes of an average sexual encounter or the number of years a New Guinean woman abstains from sex after childbirth. Points are awarded according to how close (in percent) the answer is. There is a provision for loading new sets of questions from disk.
