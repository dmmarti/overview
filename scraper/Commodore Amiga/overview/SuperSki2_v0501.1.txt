 In the sequel to Super Ski, six ski events are available - Super Giant, Bobsleigh, Slalom, Ski Jump, Moguls, and Downhill. Set in famous resorts of French Alps  such as Val-d'Isere, Courchevel, or La Tania, ski events may be practiced in Training mode, or taken on in a sequence of 2 of each in Competition mode.   Almost all events show the player from behind, except Moguls, where screen is scrolling down with players` progress, and Ski Jump, where player should come to camera from the far view. Player should avoid obstacles, stay on a route, and pass the gates in Slalom-like events; stay on the route in Bobsleigh, finish in first place with more style and jumps in Moguls, and jump good in Ski Jump.  1-2 players mode is available.
