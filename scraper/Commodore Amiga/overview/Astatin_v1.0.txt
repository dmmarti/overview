Puzzle games are usually not my cup of tea, so I don't have a lot to say here. Astatin is a competent effort: very nice graphics and some nice music. The only flaw I noticed was some broken English in the onscreen text, like "actual password" instead of "current password". That's a common mistake by German natives, since the German translation is "aktuelles Passwort".
