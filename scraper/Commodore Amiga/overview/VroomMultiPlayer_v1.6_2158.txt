 Vroom is a Formula 1 car racing game that can be played either in arcade or simulation mode. The main options screen allows you to select manual or automatic transmission, number of laps, and training, single race, or full season. The multiplayer option allows two players to race against each other on separate computers.  Each track, with different layouts and background graphics, includes many tight curves, steep grades and inclines, as well as tunnels and a pit stop.  The player-controlled car has working side-view mirrors, which allow you to view the actual action behind you, as well as a working speedometer and gear display.  The game features a colorful mix of 3D and 2D graphics, realistic sound effects, and blazing fast, smooth animations.
