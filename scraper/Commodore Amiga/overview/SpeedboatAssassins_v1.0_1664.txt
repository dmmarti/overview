 Terrorists have seized control of some of the world's most prestigious harbours, such as London and New York. As a tough marine commando, you have been sent in to launch the counter-attacks.  Sensibly, your boss drops you into the action in front of a mine field, and with no armour. Negotiate the mine field and you come into the main body of action, in which weaponry can be collected either from that which is left lying around, or by docking with a supply helicopter when it comes into view. Enemy ships are all around and must be taken out. Clear these and you reach the towers, which must be shot down, and finally a 'boss' ship to complete the level.
