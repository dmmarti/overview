Alien Drug Lords: The Chyropian Connection is a sci-fi graphic adventure game. You begin on a spaceship docked on an alien world called Chyropia. From here you need to find a way into nearby Crystal City, a place of casinos and bars and underhand dealings. It's a dangerous and unforgiving place, with lots of opportunities to meet a sudden end.

Most of the screen is taken up with the current scene in first-person view, with an L-shaped GUI bar interface surrounding it. In the bottom-right corner is a small compass rose with arrow buttons to move to adjacent locations, and across the bottom and right edges of the screen are action buttons and information display, such as how much money you have. Alien Drug Lords has three difficulty settings: "New Adventurer", "Experienced" and "Suicide Agent".
