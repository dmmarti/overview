 In Stellar 7, you drive the Raven, the most advanced Terran fighting vehicle.  You are up against Gir Draxon and his evil Arcturan army.  You will go from star system to star system, fighting his forces.  When the enemies have been destroyed, a mothership flies overhead and beams down the Guardian of the star system, a giant enemy ship.  When you reach the Arcturus star system, you will fight Gir Draxon!  This game is played from a first person view looking out from the cockpit of the Raven.  It is in true polygonal 3D.
