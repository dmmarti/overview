Overkill is 2D side-scrolling shooter, similar to Defender or Strike Force . The story is typical for sci-fi games - action takes place in 2690 A.D, the player is leader of the elite fighter corps and tries to end conflict between two big fractions. The player's ship can be freely moved on the screen (and screen can be moved in the left and right - just like in Defender). He shoots enemies, collect power-ups and rescue civilians. After a successful mission, he can choose next planet.
