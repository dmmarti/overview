 Leisure Suit Larry Goes Looking for Love In Several Wrong Places is the second game in Al Lowe's Leisure Suit Larry series. Continuing the plot of the previous game, the swinging single Larry Laffer, has finally found his true love and is happily living with her. Right? Wrong!.. Because Larry is mercilessly thrown out by his great love and is left all alone, penniless, and womanless, in Los Angeles. Accidentally, Larry comes into contact with KGB agents who will pursue him all over the globe from now on. And there is also the evil doctor Noontonyt plotting evil schemes on a remote tropical island... Looks like Larry will have to forget about his women-related problems for now... or is it so?  The second Leisure Suit Larry game introduces an improved engine allowing for full-screen graphics and mouse control for movement. There are less puzzles than in the previous game, and more ways to die.
