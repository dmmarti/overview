Zombie Apocalypse is a mouse controlled shoot-em-up where the goal is to kill as many zombies possible before you run out of energy. In every level you have to kill a certain number of zombies to be victorious. Some zombies that appears will throw hand grenades at you. Left mouse button is for normal fire and the right one is for throwing grenades. Ammo is limited but boxes with extra ammo will drop from the sky now and then (red boxes for bullets and green ones for grenades).
