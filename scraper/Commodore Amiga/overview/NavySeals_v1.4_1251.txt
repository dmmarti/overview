 Like many of Ocean's games this was licensed from a film,in this case one by Orion, the company best known for Robocop. You control a succession of the USA's elite fighters with the aim of destroying missiles held by terrorists. You must destroy the missiles by placing bombs next to them and then fleeing the scene.   You will of course meet many more fighters throughout the level, and pick up improved weapons as the game goes on neither of which fit with the film, or real-life logic, but make for Generic Ocean Film License #718. The gameplay is primarily side-scrolling, but the levels are taller than the screen.
