 At the height of the World Wrestling Federation's European fame came this crunching recreation of the elaborate hammed-up action. Hulk Hogan, The Ultimate Warrior or the British Bulldog can come under your control.  You play either in practice matches against the hopefully-misnamed Mr Perfect or in a sequence of 5 matches to win the Wrestlemania Belt. Your opponents have different special moves - watch out for The Warlord's Full Nelson and Sgt. Slaughter's Camel Clutch, for example. Before the fights start, your opponents will deliver a taunt, which you must respond to as creatively as possible.  The game is a beat 'em up viewed from a forced perspective above and behind the action. Your aim is to pin your opponent to the ground for 3 seconds, which can only be done once he has been weakened. Kicks, punches and throws will reduce an opponent's strength bar. When a strong opponent is down, stamping on him will pay off more than attempting a pin.  Avoid leaving the ring for too long - 20 seconds out and the match is void, which counts as a defeat. As in real WWF, the frame of the arena can be used to perform moves. Once players are in close contact, waggle the joystick to ensure you win the grapple.
