 The story in Antheads takes place five years after It Came From the Desert. You are Brick Nash, who has stolen plutonium and prevented nuclear tests in the desert, so the people are mad at you because they didn't get any money but some are friendly like Biff and Dusty. The police are after you and people in Lizard Breath are turning into antheads. Gameplay is similar to the main game, with a sequence of action sections linked movie-style.  Note: Requires original It Came From the Desert disks that install program will 'back up' and replace with Antheads files.
