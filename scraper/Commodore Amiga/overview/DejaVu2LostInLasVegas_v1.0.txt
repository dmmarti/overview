 Deje Vu II: Lost in Las Vegas is the sequel to Deje Vu: A Nightmare Comes True. This time you wake up in Las Vegas with great headache and realize that you are Ace Harding, who has to find $112,000 of recently murdered Chicago's racketeer Joey Siegel for his boss and Las Vegas' mobster Tony Malone. You have a choice to find money in one week or classical or else. Just for formality you are watched by Malone's thug Stogie Martin.  During the investigation in Noir style you can collect and use items, talk to characters and make some decisions. The game has a multiple windows interface, which size and position you can change.
