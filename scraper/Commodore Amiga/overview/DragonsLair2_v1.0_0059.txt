 In this port of the arcade sequel, you once again play Dirk the Daring, the brave and dashing knight who, with a little bit of skill and a lot of luck, must once again rescue his princess Daphne.  This time Daphne has been kidnapped through a wrinkle in time by the evil wizard Mordroc and it's up to you to rescue her before she is forced into marriage.  This game features every scene that was in the arcade version including scenes based on Alice in Wonderland and other classic fairy tales.
