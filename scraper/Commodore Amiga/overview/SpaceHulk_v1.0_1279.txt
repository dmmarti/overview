 Space Hulk is a real-time conversion of the original board game by Games Workshop set in the Warhammer 40,000 universe.  Players control a squad of Space Marines in an maze allowing 90 degree turns which they may view through multiple first person cameras or using an overhead map. Their mission: to wipe out the Genestealers, a vicious alien race inhabiting the derelict ships.  The 5-man squad sometimes accompanied by another, encased in Terminator armors and armed with long range and melee weapons, can be given tactical orders executed simultaneously via map - with an option to temporarily freeze time to give player more room for thinking.  The game features 51 missions, including tutorial and original Deathwing campaign. The CD-ROM re-release adds extra 9 missions and more digitized speech in slightly better quality.
