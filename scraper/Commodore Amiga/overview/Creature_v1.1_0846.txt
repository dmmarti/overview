 Distress calls received from deep space report hostile alien life forms, and you are the only space security captain within range. Responding to the distress call, you hurry to save a spaceship, a space station which has had its reactor put on self-destruct to prevent the station from falling into the enemies hands, and the lunar base that have become infested with Creatures.  The spaceship, although seemingly abandoned by the Creature, has inside, guard dogs and beastoids that fire weapons. They were left behind by their master. You must survive their attack to find life-sustaining supplies and the key to disarm the reactor. Upon receiving these, you must safely return to your ship to start your journey to the terror-filled space station. The space station has much greater danger. You must gather more essential supplies, but more importantly, you must disarm the reactor before it self-destructs. You have the key, but where is the reactor? Once this step of your mission has been done, you must make your way back out while trying to get past the alien attack droids, acid leaks, and more vicious beastoids. The final phase is to destroy the Creature which is underground at the lunar station. You soon discover that it cannot be destroyed by your current weapons. While fending of the Creature, you must look for more provisions and the explosives needed to destroy the teleportation unit the Creature will otherwise use to send for more of his own kind. Queen Creatures will try to prevent your success. Once collected, place the explosives by the unit and set the timer. Make it back to the moon's surface with your supplies and your mission will be declared a victory.
