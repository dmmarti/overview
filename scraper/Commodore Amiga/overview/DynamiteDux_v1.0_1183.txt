 The most beloved playing mode of Dynablaster is surely its multiplayer mode. However, getting enough players together all at once for a full five-player game can be bit difficult. The solution is to play it over the net instead. DynAMIte is a multiplayer network Bomberman clone which connects to various servers, just as with Quake or other more common network games. It has lots of levels, and more can be made by the users. This is one way for the various servers to stand out, by offering new levels. Similarly, new packages of sound effects and graphics may be loaded into the game to give the levels that extra touch. Users may also chat with each other during not recommended and between games.
