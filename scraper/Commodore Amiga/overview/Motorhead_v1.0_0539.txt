You are Lemmy - the leader of the heavy metal band Motörhead. Your fellow band members have been kidnapped by fans of other music genres. Our bass-guitar-wielding hero goes on a Double Dragon-esque journey in this side-scrolling beat 'em up. On each level Lemmy heads right, occasionally stopping to fight a group of enemies who pop up in hopes of beating him up.

Throughout 6 levels, each of them representing a different genre, you'll not only beat up the enemies with your trusty instrument, but also use various powers - such as an incinerating belch or a deadly bass guitar solo. You'll need to collect powerups that come out of defeated enemies - some of them will heal you, some will give you the energy necessary to use for your powers. After each level (except for the last one) you play a short minigame.
