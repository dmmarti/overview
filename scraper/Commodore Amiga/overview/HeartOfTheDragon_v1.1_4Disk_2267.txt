 An interesting game that attempts to mix a simple adventure with a side-on beat-em-up. You play as Tommy Lee, who with the help of Master Chi must defeat the evil Li-Kuan.  As mentioned the game is split into two parts: The adventure section where you wander around the map collection magical items and the fighting section, which is a standard 2D beat-em-up.  The game was noted in its time for pushing technical boundaries by having 192 colors on the screen at once!
