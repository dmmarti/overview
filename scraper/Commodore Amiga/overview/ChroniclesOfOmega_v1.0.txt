 Omega is a new direction in game design. The plot is innocent enough: futuristic tanks battling. There is a twist, however: the tanks are controlled by computers. It's your job, as the player, not to control the tanks in real time, but to learn a programming language designed for the game to build an artificial intelligence that will allow the tank to survive. Omega includes a massive manual that needs to be read before tackling the game.
