Woody is an elf who has to retrieve a magical crystal which was stolen by evil forces. To do so, he has to travel through six worlds with overall 60 levels. The game plays out as a regular platformer in which Woody walks through the level, collects power-ups, avoids obstacles (e.g. blocks with nail traps or others which crash when touched) and defeats enemies by jumping on their head. However, just reaching the end of a level is not enough; there are also a certain amount of chests which have to be found first. Those are hidden within the levels or in the plentiful bonus rooms. Power-ups either reward extra points (which eventually lead to an extra live) or special powers like jumping high or shooting. Those are sometimes required to reach a chest or bonus room.
