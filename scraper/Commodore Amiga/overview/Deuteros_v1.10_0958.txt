 The sequel to Millennium 2.2 released two years prior, is a space strategy game in which you start with a minimum amount of supplies and scientific knowledge, and must expand beyond Earth to explore and colonize other planets.  As Earth has been devastated by war, the available remaining population must be trained either for research, production or as marines in order to be assigned to their different jobs. As your research team discovers new technologies and items, and your mining facilities gather the needed material, your production team can start building the items necessary to your expansion. When your first space shuttle is built, you can launch it to build an orbital factory station which, in turn, allows you to build larger interplanetary spacecraft to reach farther planets with rare minerals.  As you colonize other planets, gather new materials, and mine asteroids, you will be able to build different items not available at the beginning of the game. Certain spacecraft can later be equipped with devices to automate asteroid mining and transportation of minerals from one location to another.   The graphics of Deuteros are dark and consist of mostly static screens with basic animations. There is no background music during gameplay, only futuristic sound effects. The interface uses simple point-and-click on different icons and buttons more functions become available as the game advances.
