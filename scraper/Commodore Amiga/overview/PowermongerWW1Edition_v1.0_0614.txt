 This add-on to Powermonger features 175 new territories to conquer. Gameplay is unchanged from the main game. You settle the land, research new equipment, deal in diplomacy and send your troops to enemy settlements to conquer them. The World War 1 theme shows in the graphics and in designations. The overall game map is that of Europe in 1914, your officers now wear WW1 uniforms, sheep have become deer and weapons are now rifles, bi-planes and tanks.
