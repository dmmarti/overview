 The final chapter of the Phantasie trilogy. This time, the Dark Lord Nikademus has set his evil sights on conquering - not only an island - but the entire world. He must be stopped, and you've chosen to undertake this difficult and dangerous quest.  Sounds like the story in Phantasie part one and part two, but the game got some improvements. Some weapons and spells have been added. During combat, you can move each character to the front, middle, or back of the party. It's also possible to aim your spells at different ranks of the enemy. Wounds are specified by body location and extent of injury.
