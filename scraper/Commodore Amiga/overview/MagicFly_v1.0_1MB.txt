 Your enemy have designed a new fighter craft, the Moth. The only prototype is held in a network of caves within an asteroid, heavily protected by 30 different types of craft. As a pilot of the T2 'Magic Fly' craft, it is your job to find and destroy the Moth.  You fly through a set of tunnels presented in a mixture of vectors and solid 3D, with arrows guiding you as to which way to go. The ship's damage is split into ten areas, and the auto-repair feature can be set to prioritise these. Energy resources are limited, and must be allocated across different areas of the ship.  Accurate steering and shooting are not enough  puzzles protect the route, and these will take some pondering. You are armed with multiple weapons types of lasers, mines, a rear-gunning-droid and various guiding missiles, each of which has its own use. You also have an on-board map and radar, as well as a turbo facility.
