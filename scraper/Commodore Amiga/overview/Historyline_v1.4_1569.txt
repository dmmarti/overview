 A turn-based strategy game set in World War I, using a similar engine and gameplay system to Battle Isle  Both players act simultaneously on a split screen. While one player can move his units, the other can attack and vice versa. The results of battles are shown in animated sequences.  Terrain affects the performance of units, and seasons affect the likely terrain. Different units are introduced as the game and war progress, with more air and sea battles later on.  There are 24 single-player maps in the game, which can be played from either the German or French perspective. In addition, there are 12  two-player maps.  The game also includes a lot of information about the period: after each mission, historical facts about two months of wartime are displayed.
