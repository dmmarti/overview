 In the game you are a noble ninja, who has to prove the honour of shogun Yuichiro by recovering a stolen sword from the evil Toranaga. Walking from a village to a castle, you fight enemies and avoid traps using your skills in martial arts and Japanese weapons, collecting useful items and uncovering the twisty plot of the story.  Using a keyboard you can walk from screen to screen, jump, and pick up items. Using two mouse buttons you can kick or punch opponents as well as use, give or drop collected items.
