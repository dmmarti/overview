 Evil sorceress Zoldrane casted an evil spell upon your Grandfather. As Nicky, you must find a way to defeat Zoldrane, and to get an elixir from her chest that will cure Grandfather.  During the travels, Nicky is able to move around the levels, jump over obstacles, and duck to avoid flying threats. Nicky must collect gems, flying bombs, dynamite, keys, and other specific objects. These are used for tasks such as building a bridge over river throwing logs, climbing ladders, using teleporters, or to break the walls to find the secret areas.   Enemy creatures are taken out by throwing apple remnants at them or jumping on them. Nicky's energy is drained if he makes contact with them in any other way. As you do all this, a score is calculated, and then listed in the high score table. Passwords are offered to allow you to resume from a previously-reached level.
