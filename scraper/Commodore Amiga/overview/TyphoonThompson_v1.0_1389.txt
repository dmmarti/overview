 Typhoon Thompson was an unusual game where you had to fly round an ocean and shoot at various unusual beasts.  The plot was that the Sea Child was stolen and Typhoon Thompson sent in to rescue it, with the guidance of a few strange, cowled ghost-types who would occasionally be nasty to poor old TT.  The game never played like a shoot-'em-up - too much persistant firing was never much use - and required more tactics.
