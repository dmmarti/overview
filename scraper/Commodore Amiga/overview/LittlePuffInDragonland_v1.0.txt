 Puff is a poor little dragon who decides to explore the world beyond his home - Dragonland. Unfortunately, he is now lost and wants to go back home! Puff is too little to do this adventure by himself so you have to guide him through many levels, solving puzzles, avoiding traps and find all four parts of the pass to get back into Dragonland.
