 Conqueror is a polygonal isometric-view tank action/strategy game with an elaborate control system emulating real tank controls on normal joysticks and two-player possibilities by switching the controls to use one joystick each for gunner and driver. The goal of the game is generally to destroy all enemy tanks on the map using a preset squad of tanks of your own. The tanks on the player's side that aren't controlled by the player act on AI, but the player-controlled tank can be switched at will via an in-game map. Alternately, the player can use that map to direct tanks to other places - but even when planning troop movements on the map, the game goes on. To top things off, there is also a limited amount of resources allocated to the player and can be gained by destroying enemies; these resources can then be used to buy new tanks before the start of the next mission..
