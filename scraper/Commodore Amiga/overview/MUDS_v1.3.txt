 M.U.D.S. Mean Ugly Dirty Sports is a slightly humorous but definitely violent game in which the game itself is won by scoring at least 7 out of 14 goals or by killing enough of the opposing team. Tackles, pummelings, being thrown into the moat -where a shark-like thing will eat you if you don't get out on time- are just some of the things that can happen to your team.  Ofcourse, there are more ways to win: bribing the opposing team, the referee, or the creature which is used as the ball are worth considering.  Should your team need a little extra morale, just pick a fight, or buy and sell players on the slave market whenever you like.  M.U.D.S. vaguely resembles Speedball in the sense that you try to throw the ball in the opponent's goal, but that's where the resemblance ends for me.
