In Highway Hawks the player controls a car with a mounted weapon. During each level, taking place on a long road, the goal is to reach the goal without dying. After each level the player can upgrade the car and its weapons with money which is earned by having a low finishing time and causing damage to other cars. Jumping over scaffolds gives a time bonus and shooting a truck may cause additional ammo to fall out. The fuel is limited and constantly drained during play, but extra fuel can be picked up on the way. The camera view is from behind the player's car.
