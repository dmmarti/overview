 Roger Wilco is one of the most important men on the starship Arcada: he is the janitor! Just when he was doing what he does best dozing off in a closet, the shrill sound of an alarm penetrated the air. Arcada is attacked by the evil Sariens! Before you realize what is going on, you discover that you are the only survivor. The Sariens have killed the entire crew and stolen the valuable Star Generator. Your immediate task will be to find a way to leave Arcada, that is about to explode in fifteen minutes. And then you'll have to show the Sariens why they should never mess with brave intergalactic janitors!  Space Quest: The Sarien Encounter is a humorous sci-fi adventure game, made with Sierra's AGI engine. You move Roger around with arrow keys and interact with the game world by typing commands. There's a lot of puzzles to solve, and plenty of situations where you'll have to use your wit to save Roger from death.
