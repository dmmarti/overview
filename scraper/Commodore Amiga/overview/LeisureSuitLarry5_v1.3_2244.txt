 Passionate Patti Does a Little Undercover Work! is the fourth game in Al Lowe's Leisure Suit Larry series. Protagonist Larry Laffer fell off a boat during a cruise and  sustained amnesia, forgetting how he and Patti got separated, how Larry got a job in LA, how Patti got a job with the FBI, and what happened in the never released Larry 4. As in the third game, two different characters with their own story are pursued. The goal is to bring Larry and Patti together while you fulfil Patti's undercover work.
