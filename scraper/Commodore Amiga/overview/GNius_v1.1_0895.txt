Genius is a puzzle game which has a similar principle as the board game Mastermind. The player gets presented with a cube network and needs to find out the colours of the cube surfaces. After making a choice, the game says how well the attempt fared and the player needs to logically work the correct combination out by making more and more attempts. There are various options to set the game, e.g. the number of cubes, an optional time limit, the difficulty level or a limitation of attempts. An option for advanced players are cubes which change their positions between attempts.
