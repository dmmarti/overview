 Atomix is a puzzle game. On each level, you are given a couple of atoms, and your task is to arrange them into a specific shapes.   In a top-down view, you see all the atoms available for you to move, and all the directions they can connect to. Down below on the left side is a small picture of what you must get. That picture represents some molecular structure that you must complete by moving atoms horizontally and vertically. Once you move your atom, it won't stop unless it bumps into something, so you have to use other atoms as blockades to prevent it from going into unwanted areas.   There are over 50 levels, and you have limited time for each level.
