 With a similar gameplay as the isometric Desert Strike, Zeewolf offers arcadesque helicopter-combat in a 3D-surrounding. Despite its mainly action-oriented gameplay, the 32 levels often involve support, transport and rescue missions - dropping or refueling friendly units in the combat zone, for example. In exchange, other units serve you as rearming points or help you fighting the enemy.  The order of the levels can be chosen freely and the game may be played with joystick or - a little unusual - with the mouse. Although the range of sight is somewhat limited, the 3D graphics are very appealing and perform smoothly while playing. Here the game uses a 3rd person-engine looking at the helicopter from the side and displaying a certain amount of landmass in a square around it.
