The year is 3033 AD. Criminals are no longer sent to jail, they are sent to the abandoned planet, Altrax. You have been wrongfully convicted of a crime and sent there. A long life is not likely among the galaxy's worst undesirables. Your only hope is to escape!
On your way to Altrax you learn that a pleasure craft ignored warning beacons and strayed in the electro-security net of Altrax. The craft was wrecked but the tiny escape pod was never found. Your only hope is to find it and escape, unfortunately, criminal gangs are also fighting to the pod.
