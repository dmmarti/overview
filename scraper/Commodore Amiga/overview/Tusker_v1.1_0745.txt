 Finding the mysterious Elephant's Graveyard in Africa was your Father's lifelong quest. When he disappears you are determined to find out what might have happened to him, and what secrets may lie within.  This side scrolling arcade adventure is split into three stages, taking in the harsh and barren desert, an underground network of caves, and a tough tribal jungle. The natives are hostile to your presence, and weaponry must be found to fend them off, although its use does little to put the natives at ease initially. The machete to cut through the jungle is equally important. At many other points you will need to use objects you have found along the way. The backgrounds are in full 3D and can serve to obscure the character when he is behind trees or rocks.
