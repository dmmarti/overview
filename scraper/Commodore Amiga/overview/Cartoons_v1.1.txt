Cartoons is an Puzzle game, developed and published by Loriciels, which was released in Europe in 1993.

Super Angel and Toon are The Cartoons. They're also cousins, best friends and animated characters with a mission. Y'see, the Monsters have stolen six magic rings. In order to retrieve the rings, Super Angel and Toons have to race around, ooh, 21 levels solving puzzles, hitting naughty things, buying good things and finding the bonus levels. Hurrah!
