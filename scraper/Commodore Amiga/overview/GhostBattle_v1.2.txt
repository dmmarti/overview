 Ghost Battle is one of the earlier games by the German company Thalion Software, who later produced such 16-bit classics as RPGs Amberstar and its sequel Ambermoon, and the platforming masterpiece Lionheart. Spanning five short yet brutally difficult worlds, the game borrows its visual style heavily from its better-known contemporaries like Shadow of the Beast and Ghosts 'n' Goblins.  A simple arcade-style action game with some rudimentary adventuring and timing based puzzles thrown in, Ghost Battle casts you as a nameless hero on a quest to rescue his, yet again, nameless girlfriend from a nameless bad guy. Enemies have a horror look and feel to them - ghouls and disembodied heads for example. Initially our hero is armed with rocks, but extra weapons can be collected for specific tasks such as the bosses who end each level.
