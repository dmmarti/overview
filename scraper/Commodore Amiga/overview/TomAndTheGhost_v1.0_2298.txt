 Seven-years-old Tom and his mother are visiting the old castle in Scotland, while evil sorcerer kidnapped the mother. Tom was very upset, but the brave ghost Sir Reginald Arrow appears to help Tom. Evil sorcerer kidnapped his beloved 500 years ago to sacrifice her for Lucifer. Tom's mother may become the last victim in the sequence of dark ritual, and Sir Arrow has only 24 hours to stop the ritual and free Tom's mother.   In the game you are controlling Sir Arrow. He may walk; jump; duck; use weapon; collect, combine and use items. Tom is near, but he should be kept in good mood. He may help you to beat monsters, but his energy is exhausting and he should be fed with Hamburgers and Milkshakes. When he is upset, you should give him a Teddy Bear. All such items as well as many others required to progress in the game such as different weapons, magic harp, or lighter, etc. are scattered within the castle. The huge doors either keep bonus items increasing your score, or monsters, or clues to solve the riddles. Tom may walk on his own, and you should blow in whistle to call him back and do not loose him.   Many enemies are trying to get your life energy out, so kill or avoid them. Do not loose Tom, keep an eye on his stats, and do not allow to scare him to death. Just find his mother, and revenge for all the victims.
