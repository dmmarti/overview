Zombie Apocalypse II is a mouse controlled shoot-em-up where the goal is to kill as many zombies possible before they reach the screen edge and zombie assistants before they perform the shot. At every level the player has to kill a certain number of zombies. The left mouse button is used for pistol fire and the right one for throwing the grenades. Ammo and grenades are limited, extra supplies are falling from the sky from time to time and are collected by shooting them down.
