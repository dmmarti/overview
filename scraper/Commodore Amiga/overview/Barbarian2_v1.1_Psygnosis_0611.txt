 Not to be confused with Barbarian II: Dungeons of Drax - a game by Palace Software - Barbarian II is a direct sequel to an action/point'n'click hybrid released four years earlier. Developed by Pandamonium Entertainment and published by the legendary Psygnosis Shadow of the Beast, Ork, Agony, the game continues the tale of Hegor the Barbarian.  After being improperly defeated some years ago, evil lord Necron has been reincarnated by one of his cult followers. Now only Hegor is strong, courageous, and stupid enough to face Necron and his minions.  Unlike the original Barbarian, which was an action game with a bizarre point'n'click control interface, Barbarian II plays just like a typical action/adventure title with a maze-like layout. During his adventures, Hegor will visit many interesting locales like a forest full of thugs, werewolves and spiky pits, a long, long cave, a semi-friendly human city, a dungeon, and finally Necron's temple. All areas are huge, confusing, and full of enemies and traps.
