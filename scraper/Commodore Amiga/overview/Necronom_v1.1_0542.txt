 A side-viewed horizontally-scrolling space shoot 'em up. There are a wide variety of targets to hit or avoid, some stationary, some with programmed attack paths and others with artificial intelligence to close in on you. The graphics have a very metallic look, similar to Cybernoid in a way. There aren't many power-ups on offer, and you aren't too dependent on them to be able to survive. However, an auto-fire joystick is strongly recommended.
