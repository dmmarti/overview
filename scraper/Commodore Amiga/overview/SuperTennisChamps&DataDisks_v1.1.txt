Super Tennis Champs is a tennis game which allows the player to participate in single matches, tournaments, a league or even the whole Grand Slam event - optionally as double. Each of the 16 available athletes has advantages which result in a unique playing style, e.g. Pablo is fast and has a good back-hand. Three different kinds of court (hard, grass or clay) also have an impact on the gameplay and ball physics. Beginners can use easier controls for serving, but overall the controls are designed for a fast-placed experience.
