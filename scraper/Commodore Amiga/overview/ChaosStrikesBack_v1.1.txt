 The Dark Lord returns in the sequel to the award-winning Dungeon Master. Using 4 player characters created in the Prison or importing your own champions from Dungeon Master, you will have to face Lord Chaos again with a challenge: to destroy 4 pieces of Corbum ore before it shatters the universe!  Comes with a Utility Disk that allows you to personalize the characters by editing their portraits and names, and provides hints if you are desperately stuck!
