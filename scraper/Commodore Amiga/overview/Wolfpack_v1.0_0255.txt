 In this WW2 combat simulation one or two players can take command of one of three different sets of naval vessels. German U-boats, U.S. destroyers or Allied merchant ships are there, waiting for the right commands. They operate in small groups, just as the real things did in WW2. Full status screens tell you what state your boat is in at any time. It's possible to play one of the twelve built-in scenarios or an self-created scenario. The game has no career mode.
