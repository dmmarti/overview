 Galaxy 89 is a Galaga clone. The player controls a spaceship that can only move left and right at the bottom of the screen. The aim of the game is to destroy as many enemy waves as possible without losing all of the extra lives.  Pressing the fire button fires a shot at the enemy attack waves, which enter the screen from different edges. The only other movement possible for the player is a diagonal shot, by moving the controller in the opposite direction they want to fire. The game gets gradually harder with waves appearing behind the player or large amounts of enemy shots the player has to avoid.  Having its roots in an arcade game, the objective of Galaxy 89 is to gain the highest possible score. Destroying waves of enemies gives the player points, as well as the bonus rounds considering mostly of cannon fodder-type enemies that occur after clearing a certain number of waves.
