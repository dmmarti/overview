The game is displayed in high contrast black and white, that's just black and white, there are no shades of grey in this game. Your ship is a small white triangle, in the centre of a black screen. When the game starts, asteroids, large irregular rock shapes, drift gently into view from the outer edges of the screen. Your ship can rotate in either direction, and fire, so this is what you must do, in order to prevent your ship from being destroyed. As your shots hit the asteroids they break into smaller and smaller fragments, and the directions and speeds imparted to them seem to be highly convincing.

Cabaret Asteroids is a near perfect conversion of Asteroids for the Amiga. Its not in technicolor, there is no music, and the sounds are simple but effective. The playability of the original has not been surpassed though. I really can't fault the Cabaret Asteroids conversion, you can play by keyboard or joystick and it feels just like 1980, but without Sting and the guys in the background.
