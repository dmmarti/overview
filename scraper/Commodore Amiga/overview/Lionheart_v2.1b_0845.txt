 As Valdyn aka Lionheart, you will have to travel deep into the territory of your king's enemy to retrieve a stolen holy relic which happens to be named Lionheart as well.  The game itself is a platform/hack'n'slay affair, similar to Rastan. You proceed through the world that is scrolling in all directions and cut everything to pieces with your trusty sword that is cocky enough to come close to you.
