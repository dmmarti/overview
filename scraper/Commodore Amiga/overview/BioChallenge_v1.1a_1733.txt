 The game is set in the future where human existence is threatened. The gene code has become weaker in every generation and is getting close to frailty. Scientists build a cyborg to save human beings. To test this cyborg they send him out for a bio challenge.  You play this cyborg  K.L.I.P.T. and therefore you take this challenge. Your only mission is to survive!  Slightly difficult 2D platform game, with nice graphics and animations and one of the best works from Jean Baudlot in case of music Amiga Version.
