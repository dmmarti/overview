 The six characters under your control in this visually exotic RPG have been genetically engineered so as to be resistant to a virus which has been spread by an evil being in the futuristic land of Perihelion. The character races include Bionecrons, Symbions and various cross-breeds.  The gameplay is controlled from a set of initial icons, with each character's vital statistics accessible from this screen as well as inventory, combat and travel options. Large distances can be traversed simply by issuing directions and letting the characters follow them. The cities have very detailed buildings, but there is little variety between them. Combat is a regular feature of the game, although its occurance is always planned and controlled.
