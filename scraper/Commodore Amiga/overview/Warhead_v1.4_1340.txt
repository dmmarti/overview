 Strategy and action are combined in this 3D space game. The setting involves a mysterious race of beings attacking humanity for an unknown reason, and the FOE-57 Spacecraft being humanity's only hope.  Once you're into space, the craft is directed using the mouse. The keyboard controls offer autopilot modes, multiple weapons including Mines and Stinger missiles, an HUD display, multiple viewpoints, targeting and navigation, all of which must be used as appropriate. The menus feature some cinematic-feeling link screens, and some moody music.
