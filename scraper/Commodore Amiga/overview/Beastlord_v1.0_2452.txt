Beastlord is an action game with puzzle-solving elements. The Lord of Darkness managed to trick the three guardians of the world (a unicorn, a hawk and a beam of light) into imprisonment and now overruns everything with his orc hordes. The player takes the role of a young man, who is called the Beastlord because he can interact with animals, and has to explore three levels with the goal to free the guardians. The levels are side-scrolling in nature, but there are many branches to map out.

The interaction with enemies offers no surprises: the player can perform a variety of combat moves in order to beat them up. Disposed enemies leave items behind, mostly food and money. However, the game requires the player to solve various puzzles in order to progress and to talk to the animals and humans found in the levels. Usually certain items need be found and used at the correct spot respectively traded for another item. Those non-fighting actions are initiated through a pop-up menu. The game also features basic magic, a day/night cycle (some actions are only possible at a certain time) and hunger which causes the need for constant fighting in order to keep the steadily decreasing energy bar up.
