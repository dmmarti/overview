Karate King is a side view single screen beat 'em up in the same style as The Way of the Exploding Fist, as you must either try to beat the computer or another player. Using different joystick combinations, each player has various amounts of moves including punches, kicks and jumping and for every good hit the player gets a point. Once a player has three points then he has won the fight and moves on to the next opponent. A clock counts down and the winner of the fight is the one with the most points.

City Defence is an early Missile Command clone. Your job is to defend several cities against deadly rays (instructions) from outer space. Missiles are fired with the mouse, which allows precise control. When they explode, they take along everything with it in a certain radius. The main goal is preventing the aliens from defeating the cities at the bottom of the screen, but extra points are scored for taking out the alien ships.
