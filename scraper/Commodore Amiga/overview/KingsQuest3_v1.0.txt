 The king and queen gave birth to two children, Alexander and Rosella, and the kingdom was once peaceful. It wasn't long until Alexander was snatched from his crib and things started to take a turn for the worse. A three-headed dragon threatens the ever-peaceful Daventry, and requires a maiden to be sacrificed every year. Rosella is the chosen one.  Alexander, meanwhile, is taken to a faraway land of Llewdor. Named Gwydion, Alexander becomes a slave to an evil wizard called Manannan who prepares to kill Alexander on his 18th birthday, for fear that he would discover the wizard's spells and use them against him.   King's Quest III: To Heir is Human is an adventure game; as in any other game using the AGI engine, you move your hero, Alexander, with arrow keys and control his actions by typing commands which are typically verb/noun phrases.
