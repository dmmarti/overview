 Based on the original classic game Lemmings, Holiday Lemmings was a small stand-alone game that was released during the early 1990s holiday seasons.  It features classic Lemmings gameplay, only with Christmas-themed levels.  The basic objective is to use the Lemmings' special abilities to create a path to the exit that all the Lemmings can follow.  Your goal is to try and keep as many Lemmings alive as possible.
