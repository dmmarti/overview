 Great Courts 2 is the sequel to Great Courts.   This tennis simulation has some nice features. First you create your player. You can distribute some character points for example: speed, forehand, backhand, etc. like a role-playing game. These skills will raise after a few winning matches. Then you must select the tournaments you will play. There are all ATP tournaments for choice-  you can also play the Davis Cup. After every tournament you get some price money. There you must play the single and double matches.  In training you can also play against a ball machine or against a friend. It's also possible to play 1 against 2.
