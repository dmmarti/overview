 Ladiiiieeeees and gentlemeeeeennnnn! Children of all ages! The Greatest Show on Earth proudly presents... Circus Games!  As a tiger trainer, you will have to put the tiger's through their various tracks. You have to do various stunts, like corkscrews and somersaults, on the trapeze.  As a tight rope walker, you need to go from one side to the other, doing handstands and somersaults along the way. There is also a lady daredevil that you do stunts with from the back of a horse.  If you do the international competition, you will have to do certain tricks for the trapeze, tight rope walker, horse trick-rider and make the tigers go through all the tricks in their routine.
