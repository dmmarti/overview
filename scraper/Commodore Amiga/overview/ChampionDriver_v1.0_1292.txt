 Champion Driver is a top-down racing game resembling Super Sprint. Five different types of cars are provided, ranging from Formula One to karts and Sportscars, each with their own handling characteristics. The races are 3 laps long and feature 8 cars. Before each race you can buy upgrades to the engine and tyres, as well as nitro boost fuel. During each race you must refuel by pulling into the pitlane, which isn't always at the start-finish line
