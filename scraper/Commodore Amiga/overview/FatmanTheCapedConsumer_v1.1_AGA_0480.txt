 One night, when Roy Fat was home, thugs from the evil Thindicate corporation kidnap Roy's old lady while she watches television, and the only way that Roy is going to get her back is to trade her for the Duplicator, and the complete documentation that came with it.  There are seven stages to the game, and there are three levels each in the first stage, only two in the rest. The object of the game is to eat all the food that there is in the level. Once all food is eaten by Roy, a tone will sound, meaning that the gate that leads Roy into the next level will be open. Stopping him from doing this is insects and other wildlife, including rats, birds, bats, and many more. Roy is able to fix this, however, by using a variety of weapons like his foot, his fat tummy, carrots, mushroom bombs, and my personal favorite, his burp. He can also jump in the air and land on his ass to get rid of enemies.   If he touches an enemy, he loses one of his lives. If he loses all his lives, the game is over.  Once Roy has collected all the food in a stage, he has to face a boss that is usually much bigger than him. Fatman can also pass flags, which lets him continue where he left off if he loses a life. Besides enemies, other hazards need to be looked out for, including spike, spikeballs, water, and fire.
