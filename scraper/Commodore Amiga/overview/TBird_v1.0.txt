 Players control a Foourd T-Bird, a transportation system capable of great speeds up to 1346 mph. Their job is to destroy the swarms of aliens  including flying saucers, tie fighters, space jellyfish, unidentifiable blobs, and the like  and dodge their fire. This can be achieved by shooting them with the standard zapper or use a smart missile to destroy everything in sight.   When an entire swarm is destroyed, getting the token that appears give the player a roving sight, sideways-firing missiles, extra lives, extra missiles, and so on. Between each swarm, a meteor shower appears, and players need to avoid being hit. At the end of each level, players have to destroy a guardian to proceed to the next, and the smart missiles cannot be used to destroy them.
