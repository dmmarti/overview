 UMS Universal Military Simulator attempts to cover the ground of games like Empire and go beyond, simulating almost every aspect of warfare in a realistic manner. Battles can range from ancient history to a science-fiction future, with famed battled such as Gettysburg and the Battle of Hastings built in. The view system operates at multiple levels, from a single unit up to the whole theater.  However, there is no naval element whatsoever and the design pays little attention to extremely important wargaming concepts like fog of war.  The game spawned a sequel, UMS II.
