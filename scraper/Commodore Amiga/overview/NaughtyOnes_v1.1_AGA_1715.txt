 The Naughty Ones come under your control in this old-fashioned platform game. Each screen is separate from the others, and involves trying to collect a key and then progress through the exit. Enemies are best dealt with by shooting one of your longer-range weapons towards them and waiting for it to hit them - this will release at least one coin, for points. Improved weapons can be collected, each of which functions for a limited number of shots.  Bonus items are often located in the more precarious parts of the level, leading you to choose whether to risk losing a life, and going back to the start of the screen although previously killed creatures remain dead when you lose a life
