Renaissance is a collection of four classic arcade machines. The games are reprogrammed and differently named, but they are closely modeled after the originals:

    Rokstorm: Asteroids variant
    Megapede: Centipede variant
    Draxians: Galaxian variant
    Invaders: Space Invaders variant

Besides the classic versions there are also contemporary versions of each game which offer updated graphics and sound. There are also slight gameplay additions, e.g. extra weapons, new enemies or shields.
