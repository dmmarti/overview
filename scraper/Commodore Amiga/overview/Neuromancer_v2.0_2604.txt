 Based on the cyberpunk novel by William Gibson.  In a grimy future, you play Case, a cyberspace cowboy who finds himself broke in Chiba City.  Find yourself a laptop and the right software for it so you can hack into databases around the city to regain your access to cyberspace.  Buy and upgrade brain implant chips to augment your computer skills, and sell your body parts to afford new technologies.  When you get to cyberspace, you'll take on the nasty AIs that guard the most important databases.  Within all this information is the bizarre secret of this world of inbred corporations.
