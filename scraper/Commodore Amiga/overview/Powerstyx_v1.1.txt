Powerstyx is a Qix variant. The player controls a dot which moves around on the screen and leaves an energy beam behind it. If a closed figure is drawn, it reveals a part of the picture behind. There are also monsters, moving on either the revealed or unrevealed parts, which cause the player to lose a life if they touch the sprite or cross an unfinished beam.

Randomly appearing bonus symbols give extras when they become visible in a just revealed area. The possible effects are an extra life, instant death, acceleration, time, extra points or winning the level instantly. Letters are caught the same way, but they are collected on the bottom of the screen - if a complete word is spelled, the level is won. The regular way of finishing one of the 15 levels is to reveal 75% of the screen.
