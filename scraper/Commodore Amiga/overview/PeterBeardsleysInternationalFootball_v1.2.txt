 Licensed around former England player Peter Beardsley, this football soccer game is viewed side-on. The only playing option is the European Championship tournament of the day, although you can choose the 8 teams from the 26 major European footballing nations of the time so the USSR, Czechoslovakia and Yugoslavia are all still complete. Two players can compete in these groups, but there's no guarantee of getting straight to a 2-player game, especially as tournaments and individual matches can't be quit out of.  The gameplay features variable strength kicks, determined by how long you hold the fire button for. In a break with realistic physics, the ball ricochets back in the direction it came from. Goalkeepers stay on the goal-line rather than using the whole penalty box.
