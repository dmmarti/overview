 As a Defender clone, Anarchy is a sidescrolling parallax shooter, in which you take on the evil Anarchists and their destructive behaviour. Your ship moves left or right on a looping level, shooting the enemies and finally the bosses. You have a single life with gradually draining energy. No less than 50 High Scores are recorded.  There are no surprises in gameplay, except the usual upgrades for your ship - X-shaped pods reveal circles, which can be collected to produce multiple fire beams, multi-directional shots, and drones with advanced cannons  The action is fast and smooth, and anybody looking for a straight shooter might take a glimpse, although the reviews from the magazines mostly ranged from bad to mid-class.  Anarchy was released under Psygnosis label Psyclapse. The manual comes in four languages: English, French, German and Italian.
