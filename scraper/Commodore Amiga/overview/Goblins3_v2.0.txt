 The third in the series of the weird adventure-puzzle games. This time you only have one Goblin to control. This was predictable just by the name of the game the word 'Goblins' lost another 'i'.  This time we control Blount, a lonely goblin travelling through the country of Foliander. Almost at the beginning he will fall in love, but his girl gets kidnapped shouldn't it be goblinapped? and so he has to go through the same kind of mind breaking puzzles to rescue her and help lots of others 'weirdoes' in the meantime.
