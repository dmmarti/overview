MicroProse made a change from military simulations by recreating golf in fine detail. This was the first golf game to operate in true 3D. This means that the player's stance and swing technique can be adjusted, and have a significant effect on the shot outcome. Although the manual's tutorial helps, it's harder to master than rivals such as PGA Tour Golf. There are six courses, an unprecedented number for a computer simulation, and tonnes of playing modes.
