 Wild West World is a strategy game in which you build up an economic empire in the old west of the 1800's. Farming, ranching, mining, and hunting, are all methods for generating cash to buy land and build your economic empire. Employees of various trades must be hired, farms, ranches, and mines established, and all must be kept supplied with livestock, food, and tools. Eventually, the only way to grow, will be to play dirty tricks on your competition, which include the hire of a gang of outlaws to harass or eliminate them, to bribe Indians to burn them out and kill their workers, and more.
