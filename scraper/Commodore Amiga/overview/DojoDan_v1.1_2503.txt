 Control Dojo Dan through 20 massive multi-directional-scrolling levels of platforms, pickups and hand to hand combat in your quest to defeat the evil tyrant VALROG, who has taken over the land of Banzaari. Levels vary from jumping puzzles to hoverboarding, flying and buggy riding.   Some people may find the game hard, due to it's unrelenting amount of constantly attacking enemies. Luckily, the controls are simple and it's combat is very similar to the punch/kick attacks of Kung-Fu Master.    The game was originally titled The Woo-Lan Kid, but was re-named to suit a younger audience.
