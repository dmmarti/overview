 A Hero Quest expansion pack with a set of new quests adapted from a similar expansion to the original board game. This time the quests follow an ongoing storyline. The Witch Lord is back, and the heroes enter the ruined city Kalos to find and defeat him. Return of the Witch Lord plays similarly to the original game, but as the manual warns, is more difficult.  For the DOS version of the game, the expansion pack was only available through the Hero Quest + Hero Quest: Return of the Witch Lord bundle.
