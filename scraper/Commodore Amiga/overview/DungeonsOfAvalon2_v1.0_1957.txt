Avalon II: The Island of Darkness, the sequel to Dungeons of Avalon, is a single player role playing game very much in the style of Electronic Arts’ The Bard’s Tale Trilogy. The plot involves the town of Isla being descended upon by an ‘Evil Force’, and the mayor appeals to roaming adventurers to save his town from the ensuing darkness which will prevail if the ‘Evil Force’ is not vanquished.
