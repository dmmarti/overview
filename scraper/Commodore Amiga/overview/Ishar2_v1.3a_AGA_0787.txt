 Ishar 2: Messengers of Doom is the sequel to Ishar: Legend of the Fortress.  Following the defeat of Krogh and the banishment of the powers of chaos, Ishar became a cultural and intellectual centre in Kendoria. Over time people came to the island and settled there and a city, named Zach's Island developed. Shandar, a monk of chaos, entered the city along with settlers from the northern lands. His trading in hallucinogens soon made him rich and powerful. Eventually Shandar controlled Zach's Island and had many followers and worshippers. He built a strong fortress, a second Ishar, to challenge the empire.  In the sequel you can import saved characters from Ishar, or create your own team.  In the game you have to explore the magic land dungeons, tree-cities, mountain paths with real graded height effect, fight the enemies, join the allies and relax in towns, which even have medieval nightclubs.   Now the area is 3 times bigger, and innovation is your ability  to use pet animals as allies in battles, and create magic potions. There are day and night cycles.
