 In Magic Pockets, you play the cool Bitmap Kid who has really deep ! pockets that can store virtually anything. Your mission is to get back your toys which were stolen by some cute looking creatures.  During your journey, you will travel through four huge worlds where you will blow out a variety of enemies. But this game isn't yet another mindless shoot'em up -- there are a lot of clever surprises awaiting you too.  You can give more damage if you press the fire key longer. Further, your weapon changes its shape and features according to the requirements of each world.  One of the best features of Magic Pockets is the incredible athletic capabilities of the Bitmap Kid. You can jump really high by stepping on your whirlwinds, and can even destroy all the creatures you hit after falling down from a high place. These are no special features -- they are all your normal capabilities. In addition, you can drive a bike, dive, and even fly when you get special items. Best of all, there are a lot of those in the game.
