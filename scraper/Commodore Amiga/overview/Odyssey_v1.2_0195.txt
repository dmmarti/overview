The hero of this game does have his share of family conflicts. His uncle murdered his father who also happened to be the king. Now, after a few years in exile, the obvious goal is to take back the throne by killing this evil man. However, the only way to become strong enough for this challenge is by claiming the power of crystals which are divided all over the kingdom.

Odyssey is a platformer with puzzle-solving elements. There are seven big, multi-directional scrolling levels which need to be conquered by finding all hidden crystals. The first three are available right from the start and the others gradually open up as a more crystals are found. A lot of time is spent with jumping over gaps and fighting the uncle's soldier with the sword, but there are many puzzles to solve. Much consists of the standard "finding an object and bringing it to the right spot", but the big catch is that the hero can transform into animals, e.g. a lion or a bird. Each animal has their own set of abilities which are needed to solve the obstacles the game throws at the player.
