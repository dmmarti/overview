In Tetra Quest the Galaxy is waiting in anticipation for the first Galactic Games, similar to the Olympic Games. But unfortunately an evil alien race stole the Phoenix Tablet and broke them into 64 pieces each. The player's goal is to recover all pieces and save the Games.

Each level (overall 384) consists of four screens which one coin each. The goal is to collect the coins in the correct order, but the player can only travel on interconnected lines - sometimes teleporter or switches have to be used to reach the goal. Also restricted to the lines are the aliens which try to harm the player, but they can be disposed of by shooting them. Some of them leave extras behind which help the player when picked up. If in a tight spot, the player can transform into a bird and fly over obstacles, but this costs an considerable amount of points.
