 Passionate Patti in Pursuit of the Pulsating Pectorals! is the third game in Al Lowe's Leisure Suit Larry series. The protagonist Larry Laffer has finally found the woman of his dreams, and can happily live with her together on the beautiful tropical island... until he gets thrown out of the house by his wife. His boss, who happens to be his now ex- father-in-law, fires him. Larry is all alone, without a woman, without a job, on an island that has long ceased to be a tropical paradise and became exploited by entertainers, lawyers, and alike. But never despair! Dressed in his irresistible leisure suit, Larry is about to conquer the world or at least its female population anew. Watch out, fairer sex, because Larry is back to his swinging self!  Passionate Patti uses the same text-based interface and the same graphical engine as the previous game. Unlike the two previous Larry games, you not only control Larry, but also - in the second half of the game - the enigmatic and beautiful pianist Patti, helping them to reach an ending that will finally bring happiness into Larry's life.
