The Enforcer is a light gun game. It was released with the Trojan Light Phazer in a bundle together with Skeet Shooting. The game shows the side of a couple of houses. In the windows and doorways of the houses several people appear and disappear. If one of them is shooting at you, it's a good time to shoot back. Either with the light gun or with the joystick and crosshair - an option that was not included in Skeet Shooting.
