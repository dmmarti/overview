 In the person of the thief Karadoc, players set out to raid the five stories of the castle Wulf.  Legend has it that it's filled with treasure. What the legend didn't say is that the Castle is also filled with deadly traps, riddles and monsters. Surviving is not only a question of defending your life.  Karadoc also has to prove his wit in collecting objects, putting them to the right use, mastering spells and solving tasks posed by the gods. Quick reflexes and jumping skill wouldn't hurt either.
