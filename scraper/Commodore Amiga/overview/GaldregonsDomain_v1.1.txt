The land of Mezron is in turmoil. The evil wizard Azazael has been resurrected and is now on the search for five gems which will grant him ultimate Power. You are a adventurer that has the task to stop the wizard. On your way you'll face medusas, evil cults of priestesses and many undead foes.

The game features a 3D view of the world, which can be explored step by step like in many RPGs of the time, e.g. Bard's Tale or Dungeon Master.
