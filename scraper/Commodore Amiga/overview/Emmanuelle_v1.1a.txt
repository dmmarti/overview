This adventure is licensed from an autobiography of the rather sordid life of Maryat Rollet-Andriane. It centres around a man's efforts to attract her - suffice to say, he doesn't do so by offering her a can of Pepsi, and the game is not aimed at the young or prudish. Most of the game involves using multiple-choice dialogue to produce the correct outcome. You will visit bars, beaches, and many glamorous cities. There are also several sub-games, as you visit a casino, fend off love rivals, and face down smugglers.
