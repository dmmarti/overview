 As the name suggests, The Cycles simulates International Grand Prix Racing, allowing a player to compete against 9 computer rivals. Choose from three classes of bike 125, 250 and 500cc, and between 8 and 15 tracks depending on the version, at five difficulty levels with the lower ones offering automatic gear changes.   The player can enter single races, or complete in a full season. The action is viewed from the handlebars of your bike, a novelty for motorcycle racing at the time. The game engine is similar to that used by Grand Prix Circuit, but now incorporates hills.
