 In the game set in mid 1930s you are a private investigator Sam Harlow, who has to solve the kidnapping of his ex-wife Rita Sweeney. At the beginning, you run away from two thugs, who want to kill you for some reason. They fail and you begin to search the town for clues, asking its inhabitants for information. But if you make wrong moves then you die - killers come from nowhere and kill you.  You have to type in the verb and the noun to make an action. Location is described in text form and presented by a picture, but sometimes the picture has more information then text provides.
