Cllassic Board Games is a collection of three classic board games to be played against a remote opponent via modem or null-modem. It can also be played taking turns at the same computer.

The games in question are chess, checkers and backgammon. The graphics are colourful, and can be seen both in 3-d from several perspectives as well as in a flat view from straight above. The package contains a phone book to keep track of remote opponents.

On the CDTV version only local multiplayer is possible. Another difference is that it features spoken directions on how to play the game. These are recorded in six different languages: English, German, Japanese, French, Spanish and Italian.
