 Greatly enhanced version of Sensible Soccer. Virtually any important soccer league in the world is included in this game, with some countries not only having premier / first division, but 2nd, 3rd, and more divisions. All important international competitions are also included club- and national-team based. The game has a career mode, where you may play up to 20 seasons as player manager or manager only. During a career as a coach you're not tied to one club / national team, meaning if you're good enough one or more big clubs make offers to you to coach their team. This works both ways. AFAICanProve
