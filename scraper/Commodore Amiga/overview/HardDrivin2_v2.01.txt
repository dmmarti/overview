 Tengen's arcade racing game Hard Drivin' featured bold 3D polygon graphics and a chaotic feeling of speed. By all accounts, the home versions weren't really good enough, so Domark had a second attempt at making a good computer game out of it.  Many of the bugs in the original, such as cars appearing through the hills, are gone. The frame rate of the game increases slightly, with the controls being more reliable. A 2-player mode has been added. There are also 4 new tracks and a course designer.
