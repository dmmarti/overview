 Masterblazer is both a remake of and a follow-up to the Lucasfilm Games classic Ballblazer.  Ballblazer is a futuristic sport played in vehicles called Rotofoils. The play field is a large rectangle made out of squares. The object of the game is to get a ball called Plasmorb into the goal, which moves along the edge of the play field. Otherwise, the rules are simple : Three minutes, two players, one victor!  The game is played in first-person on a split screen and can be played by either one or two players.  In addition to the original Ballblazer game, Masterblazer offers two new playing options: a Tournament Mode and a Rotofoil Race.
