 A Christmas-themed horizontally scrolling shoot-'em-up. Santa is attempting to make his annual gift-delivering journey while battling renegade pixies. As Santa and Rudolph journey over seasonal landscapes, the pixies attack with presents and bombs. Santa can retaliate by throwing his own presents at them. The game is divided into three main sections: Lapland, the Atlantic Ocean, and present delivering.
