 Zeppelin's second game licensed from the successful darts player has a much wider scope than the previous Jocky Wilson's Darts Challenge. The control system involves directing a hand which guides the dart, but this is constantly moving in a random arc, reflecting realistic jitters but making accurate aiming difficult at first. The standard 501 darts rules are among the six games included.  The other games include variants loosely based on football hit the bulls-eye to start scoring, then a double adds one goal to your score and bowls in which a 'jack' dart is thrown by one player, and the aim is to get your darts as close to it as possible. There are also Ten-Dart century score exactly 100 with 10 darts, Shanghai where only darts thrown at a particular area can score and Scram where one player shoots to successively knock sectors out of play, and the opponent must score as much as possible from the others.
