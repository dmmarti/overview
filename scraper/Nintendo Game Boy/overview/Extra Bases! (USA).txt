 Exciting baseball action comes to the Game Boy with EXTRA BASES. Head into a tight pennant race, and try to win it all. You have full control over every aspect of the game: pitching, batting, fielding, and running. It's up to you to determine when to put in a relief pitcher, steal a base, or go for a squeeze play. With all of the control, EXTRA BASES is almost like playing a real game.
