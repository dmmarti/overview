 Although this shares the same name as the second Bonk game for the TurboGrafx-16, this is actually a brand new adventure. It's pretty much the same as the other games in the series, where the player takes on the role of cave boy Bonk. While most of the levels are completely new, the game reuses features from the first two in the series.  In this platform game the Bonk uses his hard head to flip through the air, climb and bounce off of walls, and bash enemies.
