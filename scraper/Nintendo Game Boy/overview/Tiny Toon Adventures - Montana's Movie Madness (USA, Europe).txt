 A brand new movie theater has just opened up in Acme Acres! But, it's unfortunately owned by none other than resident spoiled rich brat of Acme Acres, Montana Max, and he's decided to run movies in which he's the hero, and Buster Bunny is his arch-nemesis! Of course, Buster can't sit too still on that, so he's going to try and enter the movies and change the plots so Montana can't win at his dirty scheme of ruining Buster's reputation!  It's all up to Buster! If he manages to change all four flicks Monty has cooked up, he can try to face Montana rabbit-to...well, spoiled kid, in a final showdown! Time to get rolling!
