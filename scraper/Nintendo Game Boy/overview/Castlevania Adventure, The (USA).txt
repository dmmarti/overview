The Count has risen again desiring revenge even more than blood.  There are four levels of dungeons, chambers and crypts.  At the end of each there is a Primary Evil who is waiting.  Your sole weapon is the Mystic Whip which you can use on enemies or candles to unleash hearts, crystals and crosses of gold.
