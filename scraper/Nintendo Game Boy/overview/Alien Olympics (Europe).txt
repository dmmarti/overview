 Alien Olympics is a wacky combination of track and field games and retro-arcade games that you play as an alien. There are 8 unique alien characters that you can choose and compete against. Each alien has different strengths and weaknesses. For example, Mr. Mune (a caterpillar-like alien) has many legs enabling him be very good at shooting events but also makes it difficult for him in racing events.  You can either compete against a friend by sharing the keyboard or against the computer. There are a total of 15 different events to compete in and you have the choice of tackling a selected few, or going through the whole series. You also have the option of practicing first to get the hang of things.  The 15 events are:  1. 50 Qrbit Dash (Racing) 2. Laser Leaping (Hurdling) 3. The Big Bounce (Long jump) 4. Laser Skeet I (Shooting Targets) 5. 200 Qbit Splurge (Racing) 6. Lunge Leap Splat (Triple jump) 7. Toxophilly (Archery) 8. Flob Flop (Shot put) 9. Saber Launch (Javelin throw) 10. Survival (An arcade/pac-man-like game) 11. Alien Hurl (Another throwing game, but your alien is now the object to be thrown by a giant robot) 12. Laser Skeet II (Shooting Targets) 13. Jetpack Tag (Asteroids-like game) 14. Lizard Leap (Pole vault) 15. Wall Jumping (High jump)
