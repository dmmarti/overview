 Sports Illustrated for Kids: The Ultimate Triple Dare lets the player compete in three different sports.  The player can either choose from snowboarding, skateboarding or bicycling and pick from five different characters (3 males and 2 females, neither of which have any discerning stats and are equal).  The goal of each game is to make it to the end of the stage in the time allotted while avoiding obstacles in order to receive points and advance to the next track.  There is also the "Triple Dare" Triathlon where the player can compete in all three events.
