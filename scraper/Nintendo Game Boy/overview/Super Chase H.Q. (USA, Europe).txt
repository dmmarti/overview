 Super Chase H.Q. is an action-oriented racing game and has - besides the franchise it belongs to - no direct connection to the SNES game of the same name. The player takes control over a police car which has to track down a villain in each of the seven levels. In each level, the goal is to reach the end within the time limit. However, there are many obstacles and slower cars which need to be avoided. Every contact reduces the time on the clock. When the level boss is reached, he needs to be taken down by repeatedly ramming his vehicle - or using the weapons which can be collected in some levels. After beating a level, points are awarded for all accomplishments (time left, passed cars, etc.) which can be invested into car upgrades (speed, handling or attack power against bosses) or turbo boosts which can be activated at any time. There are multiple difficulty levels and gearing can be either manually or automatically.
