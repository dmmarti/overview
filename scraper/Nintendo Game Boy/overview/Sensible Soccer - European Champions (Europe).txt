 Sensible Soccer - European Champions  (known in the US as Championship Soccer '94) is a soccer (football) game similar to the Kick Off series. The graphical view is from a distance overhead, making the players small on screen, but allowing player to view around half the pitch.  The basic control system involves loose control, making running with the ball (‘dribbling’ in football parlance) a skill to master, and putting the emphasis on one-touch passing, which can be easily performed by tapping the fire button.  The game features customisable league and cup competitions as well as pre-set ones including the 1992 European Championships. There are 168 teams in total, 40 European nations, the 64 top club sides, and 64 custom teams with names ranging from self-indulgent to comical, and their details are fully editable. At club and country level, each team has three star players who are more gifted that the others.
