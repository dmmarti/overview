 Goal! is a soccer game where you must beat a certain amount of teams to become the champion. You can choose between the Super Cup, Exhibition, and Penalty Kick modes, but the only way to beat the game is to beat the Super Cup mode. You can choose between a variety of teams including Germany, England, Argentina, Italy, Canada, and France. Unlike other soccer games on the Game Boy, Goal! uses a diagonal top-down view for the gameplay. After completing a game, you are given a 24-character password to continue where you left off. Throughout the game you will also be shown stats of how many games you and the other teams have won and lost.
