 As the Captain of the scout ship StarHawk, your task is to explore the Evil Empire of Axtar. Perhaps the name of the place should have tipped you off, but it's too late for regrets now--a slew of insane alien mutations are now trying to slaughter you. Combinations of technology and flesh, these bad boys have only one objective--kill. Make your way through five massive levels, fending off beasts of all shapes and sizes with any weapon you can get your hands on. Your attackers will come at you with globule-emitting eyeballs, poising-spewing phenocytes, and razor-sharp energy disks. As if that's not enough, a boss character that is even more deadly guards each level. Yeesh. Good luck.
