 Crazy Looney Tunes' character Taz has just escaped from the Acme Zoo and is now trying to find a place to live. He has discovered five tropical islands and starts to go through each to find a suitable place. Along the way, he must fight off numerous island hazards, such as quicksand and enemies, while at the same time avoiding the Big Hat Hunter who is bent to send him back to the zoo.  With the help of his trusty tornado spin and the new Taz stomp, he is determined to find a home even if it means fighting a giant dinosaur on Dodo Island.  This game is completely different from the SEGA game of the same name.
