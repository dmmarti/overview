 Top Rank Tennis is a tennis game. Players can opt to play singles or doubles matches. There are only two game modes: Official or Practice. Normal tennis rules apply. Notably for a Game Boy title, the game's scoring is completely spoken out loud as well as other words such as "play" and "fault".  Player rankings are saved using battery backed RAM.  Multiplayer up to four players using the four player adapter is supported.
