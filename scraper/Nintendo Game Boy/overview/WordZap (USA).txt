 players can choose between 3, 4, or 5 letter words. They can also enable or disable hints, allow or disallow plural forms of words and even choose the level of vocabulary used in the game. Each round has a different theme attached to it (e.g., "Any Letter"). Players have a limited time to solve each round before it ends. They also have a choice between the conventional "WordZap" mode and the "WordHai" mode; which permits players to create 3-letter words from a set of 21 tiles. Removing a tile from the screen requires using it; opening up options for building new words.  There is a built-in dictionary using a complete list of ten thousand English language words. Two players can compete against other using a Game Link.Only the "WordZap" mode is available for two-player play. All types of skill levels are accommodated in this game from novice players to experts.
