 Similar to Kung-Fu Master games for other platforms but with different levels, it is your job to fight your way through hordes of bad guys and ultimately kill the super-villain. To do this, you can use three different moves: a punch, a kick and a somersault. Sometimes you can also pick up bombs that deal a larger amount of damage. Apart from fighting the bad guys, there are also a few levels that feature Jump'N Run elements. At the end of each stage, there is, of course, a boss waiting to be beaten up.
