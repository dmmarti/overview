 Before the flashy graphics, 3D animation and 30 hit turbo combos, there was the simple dragon punch and fireball. In this very scaled down version of the original Street Fighter II arcade game, you can choose from a select group of warriors including Ryu, Ken, Guile, Blanka, M. Bison, Chun Li, Zangief, Balrog and Sagat, each with a unique fighting style and special moves. Play through the one-player arcade mode and fight your way through each character in the game to the final boss, Bison, or play against a friend in two player mode.
