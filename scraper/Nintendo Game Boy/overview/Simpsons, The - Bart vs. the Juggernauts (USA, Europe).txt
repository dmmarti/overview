 Bart versus The Juggernauts is both a Simpsons game and a parody of the "American Gladiators" style TV shows that were popular in the early 90's.   The premise is that Bart is a contestant in a series of goofy contests that pits him against various Springfield characters.  Gameplay is basically series of mini-games that vaguely mimic other sports such as skateboarding, wrestling, and basketball.
