 Boggle Plus brings word-forming fun to the GameBoy. You can play classic Boggle, where you must form words of at least three letters from a board filled with randomly generated letters. Other modes of play include Big Boggle, where there are more letters; Categories, where you must find words that are related to a topic; Anagrams, which calls for you to unscramble words; and Use All, in which the goal is to use every letter on the board. Since there is a dictionary that contains 35,000 words, it is unlikely that you will find a word that has not been included. If that happens, you can override the dictionary for such an emergency. You can also challenge your friends to game via a link cable. Now you can test your brain and your spelling skills with Boggle Plus.
