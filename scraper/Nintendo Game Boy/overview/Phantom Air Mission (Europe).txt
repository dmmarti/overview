As a pilot of a F-4 Phantom II the player's mission is to patrol the skies of the gulf because of renewed hostile activity. Phantom Air Mission is one of the few combat jet fighter games on the Game Boy. It features fully instrumented control panels, HUD targeting, radar and landing displays, complete 360 rotation and many more features. Most missions require the player to take out one or multiple bogeys, without crashing. The game's style is very similar to Flight of the Intruder.
