 Fist of the North Star is a versus fighting game starring 11 characters from the Fist of the North Star franchise. Fights are either one on one or five on five. Each character can punch, kick, and jump, and in addition each has a specific special attack: either a tackle or a fireball projectile that must be charged up. After a fight characters level up and gain stat points.  A two player multiplayer game is possible with a link cable.
