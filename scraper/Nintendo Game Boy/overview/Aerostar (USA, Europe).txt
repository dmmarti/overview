 Aerostar is a top-down, vertically-scrolling shooter. The player controls an aircraft, but instead of going all across the screen, it can only stay on or fly over a preset road. However, it can ascend at the cost of disabling your weapons before descending back onto either another road or the one it was on before. Like most top-down shooters, there are power-up pods which provide an array of missiles, lasers, and guardian pods. In the end of each level there are extremely tough bosses. No storyline is provided.
