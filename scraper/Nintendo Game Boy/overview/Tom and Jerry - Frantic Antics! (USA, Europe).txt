 In Frantic Antics the player can either choose from Tom or Jerry and travel through ten levels of hostile enemies and various traps and pitfalls to save a runaway by the name of Robyn from her Aunty Figg and reunite her with her father.  The gameplay is the standard platformer where the player dodges various obstacles and knocks out various enemies.  Various power-ups include hearts that will give the player an extra life, stars to replenish their health and cheese, fish and pizza for extra bonus points.
