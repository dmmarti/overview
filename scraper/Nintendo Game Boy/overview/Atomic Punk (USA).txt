 Atomic Punk, which was released as Dynablaster in Europe and Bomber Boy in Japan, is a game from Hudson Soft's Bomberman series.   The game offers two single player and two multiplayer modes. The single player mode called "Game B" has the classical Bomberman gameplay, while the mode "Game A" introduces several variations. The levels in Game A are divided in nine areas, which can be accessed in any order from a world map. Depending on the time taken to finish a level and the number of blocks destroyed, the player gets a certain amount of gold, which can be used to buy power-ups (called "panels" in the game) in shop, which in term is accessed from the map. Power-ups allow, for example, to revive Bomberman when he dies in a stage or to increase the length of an explosion. Before entering a new area, the player chooses which panels to use in order to complete the area.  The multiplayer mode are both player vs. player modes. In "Panel mode", each player can place only one bomb at a time and the bombs' radius starts at one, but panels appear in the field to improve this. In "Powerful mode", no panels appear, but each player can place up to four bombs at a time and the radius is four.
