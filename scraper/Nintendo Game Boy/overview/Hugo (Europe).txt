 In the games' story, the hateful witch named Scylla arrives at the home of Hugo the troll and kidnaps his wife Hugoline and their three children (Rit, Rat and Rut) because she needs them for a magical beauty treatment. Hugo must rescue them and defeat Scylla to bring peace to the woods, despite the obstacles the witch places in his path on the way to her lair. The player must complete a number of minigames and guessing games to rescue Hugolina and the children.
