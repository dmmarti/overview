 Skate Or Die: Bad'N Rad is a Jump'N Run that consists of 7 levels, three of which are viewed from a top-down perspective. The side-scrolling levels play similar to other Jump'N Runs, as you have to avoid obstacles and kill enemies by jumping on them. However, since you are on a skateboard, speed plays an important role, meaning that you cannot immediately stop and sometimes need to drive at full speed to manage wider jumps. The top-down levels play more similar to other Skate Or Die games as gradients influence your driving while you are trying to avoid obstacles, enemies and deadly spikes.
