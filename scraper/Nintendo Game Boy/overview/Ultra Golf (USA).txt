 Ultra Golf is a golf game with two courses which can be either played in training or tournament mode. After inspecting the field from a overhead view, the shot is performed from a separate window. First the player gets to choose the direction and club and then the classic "two click" system comes into play: a symbol moves on a circle and its position after pressing the button influences the drift and strength of the shot. It is important to consider the wind direction.
