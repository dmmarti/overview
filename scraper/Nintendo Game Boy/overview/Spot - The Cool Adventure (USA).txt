 In Spot: The Cool Adventure the player takes on the role of Spot, the 7UP mascot. The player is tasked to help Spot get home. The player will find him/herself in the Carbonated Forest on a map screen much like that of Super Mario Bros. 3. Each sub level has baddies such as snails, birds, bats and evil bouncing Spots. Spot cannot come into physical contact with baddies as that is bad for spot and will knock a heart off Spot's life bar. Spot can either jump with A or pick up/throw blocks with B. Throughout levels Spot collects 7UP Spots as well as hearts. Spots add to the Spot count. Hearts add to Spot's life bar. Both Spots and Hearts add to the overall score. If a block on a platform is just barely preventing Spot from jumping high enough to get on it, Spot can pick the block up in mid jump.  The game features two difficulties.  Spot: The Cool Adventure is a reskinned version of McDonaldland.
