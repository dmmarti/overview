 The final (no joke) Final Fantasy Legend title to grace the Game Boy, FFLIII tells the story of a great flood which destroys cities in the past, present and future.  As you control a party of 4, with a choice of human and mutant classes, and travel back and forth through time collecting pieces of the great ship Talon so as to defeat the enemy that has flooded the lands.  The inclusion of a time travel storyline means that whatever you do in one time frame can have an affect on what happens in another time. Other major changes compared to the original 2 in the series are the ability to mutate your characters further and a change to the upgrade system. Items picked up after battle can be attached to your mutants or humans to turn them into monsters or robots, increasing your parties power and abilities. And although the original system of obtaning experience points after every battle has been removed, its replacement allows you to choose which magic stone each character can use, so they learn that specific magic type and never lose it.
