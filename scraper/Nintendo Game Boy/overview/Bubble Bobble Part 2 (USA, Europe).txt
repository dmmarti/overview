 The bubble-blowing dinosaurs continue their adventure in Part 2, where you must catch then pop enemies in the bubbles from your dino over many side-scrolling levels. Special bubbles litter the arenas that unleash special attacks including fire, floods, thunderbolts and more. Only one player can play.
