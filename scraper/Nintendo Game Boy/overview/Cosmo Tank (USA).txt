 CosmoTank is a space tank battle game. You're the commander of the tank 'Tiger a-1' and your mission is to fight on land and in space against the Master Insect and his minions. The game features both top-down levels and first person levels in which you can freely move around in all directions. Settings feature both open outdoor environments, caves and space.  Slowly upgrade your cannon and armor as you progress for more firepower and the ability to sustain more hits.
