 This version of We're Back far differs from its Genesis and SNES versions.  The player takes control of Rex and must save his three dinosaur friends, Woog, Dweeb and Elsa, from Prof. Screweyes who has imprisoned them in his castle and it is up to Rex to save him.  There are 16 levels in all, ranging from jungles and caves in prehistoric times, fighting off various bad guys such as pterosaurs and other dinosaurs while avoiding obstacles and pitfalls scattered throughout the levels.  There are also power-ups to replenish health and obtain extra lives.
