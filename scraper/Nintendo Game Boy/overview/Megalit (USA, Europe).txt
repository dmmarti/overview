 Megalit is a puzzle game in which the player was trapped by a witch who also kidnapped a lot of women with magic crystals. The only way to free the hero is to solve the Megalit puzzles. Those puzzles consist of single rooms in which blocks of varying forms are stacked up; the goal being to have every block touch the ground. To do so, the player moves around a blob-like protagonist who can jump and push respectively pull the blocks. However, they can only fall a small height before breaking which instantly fails the level.  There are two playing modes with 30 levels each. "Easy mode" features easier puzzles and unlimited tries. "Quest Mode" introduces a time limit and more complex rooms.
