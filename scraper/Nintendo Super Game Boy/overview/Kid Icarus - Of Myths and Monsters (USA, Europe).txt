 An evil force is threatening to invade the Angel Land.  Palutena, the ruler-goddess, sends a warrior named Pit on a quest to prepare for the upcoming attack. Pit must find three ancient treasures and face down the evil force.  Kid Icarus: Of Mythis and Monsters is the Game Boy version of one of Nintendo's classic side scrolling platform/adventure games. Throughout the levels Pit will collect hearts, upgrade his strength, collect treasures, and learn to fly.
