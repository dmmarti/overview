 You are in control of the ultra high-performance fighter ship, the SolarStriker.  It is your mission to attack and destroy the main Reticulon base.  There are six vertical scrolling stages that you must progress through in order to destroy Reticulon.  Each stage is under control of a boss which must be destroyed to clear the area.  One of the first shooters for GameBoy.
