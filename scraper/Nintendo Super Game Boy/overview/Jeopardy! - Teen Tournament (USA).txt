 Remember Jeopardy!? That show with 3 adults going against each other in a trivia based game show? This game is based on the Teen Tournament version they would occasionally run.  The same rules apply as in normal Jeopardy!: Pick a question, answer correctly, get money, repeat until victory (or defeat). There are just more teen-friendly questions. Although the answers will be difficult for todays teens.
