 The handheld versions of their console brethren still features the PGA license, but is missing the pros and instead uses generic golfers.  Additionally, only three courses are available for play: Sawgrass, Summerlin, River High and has four game modes: Practice, Putting, Driving, Skins and Tournament.  The gameplay is similar to many others of the genre, the player is shown an overhead view of the map and then taken to a perspective directly behind the golfer.  Using the D-pad to move a cursor on screen to aim their shot and pressing a main button to activate the power/accuracy meter below, pressing once to set the power and again for accuracy.  Each version also has multiplayer capabilities using their respective Game Links (Game Gear has four player capabilities while Game Boy only features two).
