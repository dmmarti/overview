Unlike other console football management games at the time which were ports of existing PC titles, LMA Manager was designed exclusively for the PlayStation. The game is notable for its intuitive control system, where the L1 and R1 shoulder buttons of the controller switch between different sections of the game (e.g. from the Transfers section to the Squad section), and L2 and R2 switch between sub-screens within a section (e.g. from the Select Team screen to Editing Tactics). As a full management sim, players can start an open-ended game, or face one of the ten challenges.

The data is based on the 1999/2000 season player and team statistics. The kits and teams are authentic, with 8,000 players and 294 clubs in 32 countries. As a manager, you control the club finances, take care of coaching, stadium development and player management. During the matches, shown in 3D, managers can make tactical changes and substitutions at any time. There is also an after-match TV show with results, highlights and commentary.
