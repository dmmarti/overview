World League Basketball, part of the Mindscape Sports Advantage series, is a realistic basketball game developed using motion capture and physics of real players. Change the rules of play for arcade, custom or simulation game with control over the difficulty level to time length of actual play from 5 minutes (10-minute default) to a maximum 25 minutes. Players can choose "exhibition play" for practice matches between teams, before committing to one team for a 30-game "season play" or six-round "tournament play" in prearranged series of scheduled games against 36 different countries of various abilities. The latter two allows for simulated games to skip matches - if desired with results automatically calculated by the computer. View statistics of your team before embarking in a match to determine the best on-court positions from point guard to centre of talented team members according to their performance and capabilities. Freely adjust player attributes from height, weight, strength, endurance to ball handling skills.
