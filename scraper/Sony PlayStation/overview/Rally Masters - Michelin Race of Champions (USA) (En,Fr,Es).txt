This is the OFFICIAL game of the real Race of Champions! Take the various authentic ROC cars (22 in all) through different tracks on head-to-head SuperSpecial challenge modes or traditional rally stages as you speed and slide through mud, gravel, snow, and more. Five levels of difficulty will let you learn at your own pace. Multiple game modes (RoC, Challenge Cup, Challenge Trophy, time attack, single race, single stage) keep you challenged. Run races online with other players through dedicated servers or setup your own.
