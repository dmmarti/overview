Once you have constructed a team you can move them onto the field and take part in various modes of cup and league play. There are a wealth of option menus to wade through which allow you to tinker with every aspect of the game. Rules of play, leniency of the ref, injuries, fouls, there is even an option to turn up the on-field violence.
