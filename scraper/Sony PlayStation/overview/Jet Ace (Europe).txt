Jet Ace is another After Burner (a 1987 Japanese arcade game by Sega in which the player control a F-14 Tomcat jet which must destroy a series of enemy jets throughout 18 stages. The jet itself employs a machine gun and a limited set of missiles. These weapons are replenished by another aircraft after beating a few stages. The aircraft, cannon and missile buttons are all controlled from an integrated flight stick).clone. The player controls a plane and have to destroy the enemy ships in a level to advance to the next mission. The big difference in gameplay between this game and After Burner is that in this game there isn't an aircraft that replenish the weapons since the player has to pass through some circles to replenish his weapons.
