The Note is an action adventure survival horror title, you move around the levels in a first person view and can interact with almost everything in the rooms. Curtains can be opened, fireplaces can be lit (granted, if you have any wood) and items such as paintings can be examined for additional info.

The game allows binding functions such as Check, Open or item-based functions such as Shotgun or Match to the shoulder-buttons, so you can use doors and weapons without going through the menu every single time.

In the general fashion of survival horror games, you must lit torches or open curtains in order to access dark corners, ie. to use a key to a nearby door or to examine a painting closely. You must also conserve your ammunition since nightly creatures such as rats, bats, werewolves and zombies roam the levels.

You can exit the levels and visit the city where you can buy and sell supplies, rest or save your game. These parts work much like menu based role playing games.
