Muppet Race Mania lets you race go-karts with the Jim Henson critters, in a game with nods to Super Mario Kart.

The tracks are based on locations from all six movies, so gamers can expect to find familiar areas; ranging from the skyline of Manhattan, to the cold reaches of Outer Space. 

Each Muppet movie, 'The Muppet Movie', 'The Great Muppet Caper', 'Muppets Take Manhattan', 'The Muppet Christmas Carol', 'Muppet Treasure Island', and 'Muppets From Space', has 4 related tracks. Therefore, 24 courses in total.

At the outset there are 8 Muppet drivers available: Kermit, Miss Piggy, Fozzie, Rizzo, Gonzo, Beaker, Rowlf, and Animal. As a reward for winning races more characters are unlocked - with 17 other Muppet stars made available.

Also included, are FMV scenes taken from each movie.
