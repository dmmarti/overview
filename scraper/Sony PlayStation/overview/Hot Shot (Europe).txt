Hot Shot is another game released by Phoenix as a cheap title for the Playstation one console and the gameplay is similar to arcade games Blood Bross or Cabal (but without the 2 players mode), in the part that the character is viewed from behind and the player has to defeat all the enemies in each level to advance to the next one. In the game the player takes the role of the futuristic bounty hunter that have to chase some prisoners in a military facility and you have to shoot the enemies until reaching the number requird to end the level. An enemy gauge at the bottom of the screen decreased as foes are killed. The bad parts of the game is that it looks more like a demo because the player doesn't have a good control method and the tanks energy got full again when the player is killed...
