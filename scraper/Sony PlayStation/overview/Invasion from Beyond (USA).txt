Strange sights have been seen in the sky, crop circles appear on the ground. These can only be signs of an alien invasion. The people are scared and Area-51 is called up to defend the planet.

Invasion from Beyond is a 3D flight combat game. Choosing from a selection of different ships (more of which can be found during the course of the game), the player takes to the skies. Each ship contains a primary weapon, a secondary weapon and a Suk-O-Matic which can be used to retrieve items and people in order for them to reach safety.
