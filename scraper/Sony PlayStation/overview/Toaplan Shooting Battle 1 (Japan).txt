This shooter retro pack from Banpresto contains: Tiger Heli (1985), Kyukyoku Tiger - also known as Twin Cobra (1987) plus the all-important Arcade-vertical mode on all games and some excellent remixed soundtracks.
 Probably more aimed at hardcore retro shooter fans and collectors though due to the extreme difficulty of the titles on offer here - older Toaplan vertical shooters are still renowned for their toughness.
 Also note that the compilation is monikered #1 which at the time boded well for further re-releases of classic Toaplan shootemups.. but alas, as far I know No.2 in the series, or any other further volumes.. failed to materialise.
