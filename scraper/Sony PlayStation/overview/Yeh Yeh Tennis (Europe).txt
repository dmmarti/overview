Yeh Yeh Tennis is an all-new tennis simulation from Sunsoft. The way the game is structured allows players to create their own players from scratch choosing not only the physical attributes of the players and their characteristic styles of play but also their temperament. So for example you could choose a left-handed smash and volley player with a fierce backhand and a fiery temperament who excels on clay. Or a defensive back-line player with a mean forehand drive and an attitude that is as cool as a cucumber and who perhaps favours the more traditional grass surface. Once the individual qualities of your original player have been chosen then the job of steering this player through the modest local tournaments, the more illustrious national tournaments and then the prestigious Grand slam events begins. The player must hone his or her skills using practice modes or match practice to gradually increase their world ranking until he or she is an established seeded player ready to take on the very best. The player has seven seasons in which to become the Grand Slam Champion and thereby the world number one. The tournament pattern itself is taken from the real life structure of competition so players can really immerse themselves in the competitive world of the Pro-Tennis and make this a thoroughly entertaining and absorbing experience.
