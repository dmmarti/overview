Hellboy: Dogs of the Night (also released as Hellboy: Asylum Seeker) is a third-person adventure game in which you play as Hellboy- Mike Mignola's comic-book hero and paranormal investigator.

     The game takes place in 1960's Prague, during Hellboy's early work with the BPRD (British Paranormal Research Division).  Hellboy and Sara are investigating their missing agent Peter, who lost contact with his team somewhere in Czechoslovakia.  It's up to Hellboy to uncover the events surrounding that disappearance, and set things right. 

     Gameplay is similar to Capcom's Resident Evil series, with adventure-game dialogue and puzzles punctuated with fights.  The game is fully 3D, with a bleak artistic style that is unlike the comic.
