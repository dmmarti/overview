Gekioh is an updated port of the classic Saturn shooter Shienryu, itself a conversion of the 1996 coin-op. The game is a standard 2D vertical shooter with a near-future military theme. The most notable aspect of this update is the numerous bonus modes the game offers, which a generally either very difficult or completely absurd, including one which adds a laugh track to the game, and another which imitates the extremely-low-resolution LCD display of the PocketStation.
