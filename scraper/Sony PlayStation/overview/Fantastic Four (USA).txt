In this beat-em up side scroller, you have a choice between five characters from the popular Marvel comics series: the Human Torch, Thing, Mr. Fantastic, the Invisible Woman, and She-Hulk. Each player has four special moves, one of which can only be executed when you collect enough force energy.

One aspect of the game is that you can change between characters at any time. If you can't get past a boss with Mr. Fantastic's stretchy moves, you can switch to the Human Torch and set them on fire.
