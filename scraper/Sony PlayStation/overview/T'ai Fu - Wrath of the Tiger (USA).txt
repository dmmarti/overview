T'ai Fu looks to avenge the destruction of his village by the dragon clan.  He travels through ancient China, seeking out masters in the various animal styles of Shaolin Kung Fu to teach him the skills he needs to defeat the dragon clan. In addition to the various animal styles that T'ai learns, the masters will teach him to focus his 'chi' or inner energy to produce some energy blasts that no enemy will be able to survive.

T'ai Fu uses a blend of fighting with exploration. The player controls T'ai from a 3rd-person view and can simultaneously use all the different Shaolin Kung Fu moves that he knows. During battles, he can complete complex combo chains that will give him 'chi' and health. The game will call out which styles were used and how long the combo was.
