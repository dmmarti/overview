Stock Car Racer is a single player race game.  This is a basic game. There are six cars and the player can choose one of them after which they race around one of eight tracks against the other five cars. There is no high score table, there is no career mode, no car customisation feature, just a straight race game.  As well as changing the sound volume the player can customise the game by changing the difficulty level, the number of laps in a race, and by turning vibration on/off.
