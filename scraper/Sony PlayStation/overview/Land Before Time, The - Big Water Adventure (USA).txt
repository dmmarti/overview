The Land Before Time: Big Water Adventure is a single player platform game based on Disney's film The Land Before Time IX: Journey to Big Water. The storyline is the same, Little Mo is stranded in the Great Valley after torrential rain and must return to the Big Water to rejoin his family. So Littlefoot, Ducky, Cera or Spike and Petrie all help him get there.  The game consists of a series of short levels in which the player runs across the landscape jumping over chasms and collecting tree stars. Every couple of levels there's a challenge such as a race which must be completed successfully in order to progress. These challenges can be completed as either Littlefoot, Ducky, Cera or Spike. Mo has his/her/its own game when the Big Water is reached and Peitrie has a picture puzzle game using pictures that are unlocked as the player progresses through the game collecting tree stars.  There are no lives in this game. The player may fail on any jump multiple times and they are still taken back to a point where they can restart and try it again.
