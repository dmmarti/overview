Based on characters from Fisher-Price's Rescue Heroes toy line, Molten Menace has players saving the town of Misty Peaks from a volcanic eruption. Each of the six levels features a different character whose primary goal is to rescue stranded victims. Special missions can also be attempted on each level, which may involve saving animals, dousing fires, or clearing a path for trapped people. Each rescue attempt earns players honorary badges at mission's end, but running into hazards on a level can take badges away. Ariel Flyer uses her piloting skills to save people on rooftops while avoiding lava bombs, electrical charges, and waterspouts. Rocky Cannon's mission involves using a grappling gun to hoist himself across lava flows to reach stranded people. Air Rescue Specialist floats through the air on a glider to grab people standing atop their homes, while Gil Gripper navigates the town's flooded waters using his jet ski to find potential victims. The final two missions involve Jake Justice and team leader Billy Blazes. Jake drives his motorcycle across a dangerous highway in an attempt to save construction workers. Players can jump across obstacles, such as potholes, to save the day. Billy Blazes uses his fire truck to free people trapped inside burning buildings. As players approach a person in need, they can raise the vehicle's ladder to complete the rescue. Molten Menace offers two difficulty levels as well as an option to save progress using a memory card.
