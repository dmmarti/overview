Muppet Monster Adventure is a action platform game, best compared with Spyro but with Muppet characters and a Halloween or ghost house setting.

The story starts with the Muppets attending the reading of Dr. Honeydew recently deceased uncle's will. Instead of going on a holiday to a tropical resort, Robin and the others find themselves at a rundown, creepy castle. Upon arriving Kermit, Miss Piggy, Fozzy and others are captured and now it's up to young Robin (Kermit's nephew) to save the day.

The gameplay is best described as a collect-and-explore-em-up. You have to explore all the vast areas and collect gems and tokens. The HUD displays how much you have collected in a certain level. To get 100% you really have to find every corner and figure out how to get onto the hard to reach platforms.

In the first few levels, Robin gains four special powers by collecting special Muppet coins. When all coins of a group are collected, Robin can morph into different types of monsters at certain places. An icon will appear in the top right-hand corner, indicating that you can use this special ability. You can fly or float, climb certain walls, do a karate chop to break obstacles, or gain extra strength to push objects.

There are lots of large areas to explore. After every few levels the setting is changed. You go from the castle courtyards to large underwater sections, from Arabian nights setting to icy snow levels. During the game, Pepe the King Prawn appears in lots of places to give you gameplay advice. In each level, there also are a lot of mini games to be found, such as a race against an computer opponent to get to a certain location.
