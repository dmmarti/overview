Zeitgeist is a 3D shooter in which the player controls a futuristic fighter jet flying through space. The lone hero must battle multiple waves of aliens and asteroids, fly across planets and inside space stations, as well as combat large mother ships and other boss enemies. The game only allows limited movement of the jet, prompting the player to focus on targeting and destroying as much as he can on his path. The jet that has two main weapons, and a laser sub-weapon that homes into targets. Unlike most other shooters, this game does not have any power-ups.
