In 007 Racing you can get behind the wheel of James Bond's car.

You must complete missions which range from collecting something and getting out alive to much harder and complicated things. Your car is armed with many weapons including mines, rockets, lasers, smokescreens, and more.

Then, if you get bored playing by yourself you can eliminate your opponent in multiplayer missions where you have to destroy the other car, or a game mode called "Pass the Bomb", where you must pass the bomb to the other car by touching it before you blow up.
