Bubsy 3D is a polygonal platformer, and one of the earlier games released domestically for the Sony PlayStation.  It is a continuation of the Bubsy series, which debuted on the 16-bit platformers back in the early 1990s.  The game's graphics are predominated by flat-shaded polygons.  The gameplay is broken up into a series of stages.  The typical goal is to find pieces of a broken spaceship.  The game supports both password saves and the PlayStation Memory Card, but it does not feature analog support.
