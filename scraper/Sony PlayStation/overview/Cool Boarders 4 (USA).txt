The fourth title in the popular PlayStation snowboarding franchise. 

This time, choose from 16 pro-riders and 34 boards (or create your own rider and board). Pick one of the 30 courses and race through the course as fast as possible in the downhill event, or concentrate on pulling off big tricks in the halfpipe, slope style, and big air events. 

For those who want test all of their skills, there is a tournament mode where the boarder competes in all five events. 

The game also features multiplayer modes, and supports analogue control.
