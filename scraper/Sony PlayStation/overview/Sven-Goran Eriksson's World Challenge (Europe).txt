Sven-Göran Eriksson's World Challenge is a soccer game. It features 204 national teams from all over the world. There are six playing modes: Exhibition match, training, league, play-offs, World Cup qualification or World Cup championship. It uses the same handling as the Kick Off series, which means the ball doesn't stick to the players' feet. There are just three buttons to use: shooting, passing and tackling. The whole technical side of the game is the same as in Kick Off 2002.
