Tail Concerto is an anime anthropomorphic / furry 3d platform adventure. You play as the character Waffle Ryebread, a police office as you track down and try to arrest the black cat gang.

You travel in a mech and can travel between the different lands in an airship. You interact with the townsfolk gathering clues and frequently battling the black cat gang (capturing the kittens).

The game also features anime cut scenes, and voice dialog during important events. This game has a similar feel to the games Mega Man Legends and The Misadventures of Tron Bonne.
