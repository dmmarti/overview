Moon Cresta is a two-dimensional, single screen shoot-em-up in the same mould as Taito's Space Invaders and Namco's Galaxian. The player begins the game with a small spaceship armed with a single laser cannon. After successfully completing the first four waves of alien attacks, the player must attempt to dock his ship with the next 'stage' of the ship. This second stage has two lasers in addition to the original one. (Each docked stage is one of the player's "lives". This concept of docking two "lives" together to increase firepower would later reappear in Galaga.) 

Coupling software faithfully transplanted two titles of old classics arcade shooter manufacturer "Nichibutsu" venerable. In addition to the "Moon Cresta" became a huge hit in the 80s and catchy sound effects, such as by high-packed gameplay to graphics novel idea, it also included "SF-X" of the rare games.
