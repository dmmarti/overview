Reel Fishing II is a fishing game which uses full motion video as backgrounds. Within the different fishing grounds, the player can't move freely but is restricted to certain hot spots. Then the waiting game starts until a fish bites and the camera goes underwater to show the fish and fishing line from the side. The player needs to balance giving lure, baiting and setting the hook to be able to get the fish out of the water. The player can choose between different fishing tools.  The main playing mode involves unlocking new areas by fulfilling requirements for the available fishing grounds within a time limit. Between the fishing sequences, time and seasons advance which has an impact to the areas. Besides this, there is also a free playing mode.
