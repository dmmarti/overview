Barbie makes her first appearance on the PlayStation with 'Barbie: Race and Ride'.

Help Barbie take care of a stable of horses; groom the horses or feed them a variety of foods including apples, carrots, strawberries, and sugar cubes. After the steed is taken care of, go on a casual ride around Secret Valley. 

Explore the beaches, meadows, mountains, and forests to discover new animal friends, mini-games, and puzzles. Find the pieces of the missing postcard and discover the secret of Secret Valley. For those with a more competitive streak, there are races and jumping contests.
