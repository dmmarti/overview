The Madden football series makes a final appearance on the PlayStation with Madden NFL 2005. Compared to its predecessor, it is little more than a roster update: it uses the same menus and offers the same playing modes and features. Besides updated teams, it also offers new music tracks.  The included teams have been updated for the 2004 NFL season and include the 32 regular teams, NFC and AFC all-star teams, more than 100 classic NFL teams, 31 all-time franchise teams and the 6 NFL Europe teams.  The returning modes are Exhibition, Season, Franchise, Custom League, Tournament, Coaches Corner, Situation (including Great Games), and Two-Minute Drill. The Madden Classic mode that puts the current teams into Madden 92 also returns, as does the card-collecting sub-game Madden Cards.
