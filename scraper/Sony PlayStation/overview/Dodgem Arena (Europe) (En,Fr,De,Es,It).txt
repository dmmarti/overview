Participate in the thrilling sport of the Dodgem Elite League.

Dodgem Arena is a futuristic racing game that takes place in 2049 AD. In this racing sport four players controlling so-called dodgems hover in huge bowl-shaped arenas, while trying to shoot an ice hockey puck into a goal at the top of the arena.

You can choose between various dodgems and during the match you can stockpile weapons, ammo and shields to improve your dodgem. There are six stadiums and each match has four rounds. The first round starts with four pucks, the second with three, until one is left in the final round.
