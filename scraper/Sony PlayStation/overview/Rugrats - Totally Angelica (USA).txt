Rugrats: Totally Angelica is a 3D Action game based on the Daytime Emmy-award winning animated television series Rugrats. The game is aimed at girls and prominently features the character Angelica from the series.

Angelica has to star in a fashion show, and on top of that she lost her doll in the shopping mall. As Angelica, you have to enter the Fantasy World Shop to save her. The Mall has six floors and the Fantasy World Shop is at the top. At the end of each level, the Rugrats babies have to judge your appearance in order to let you advance to the next level. The mini-games are in 3D just like the rest of the game. Some included mini-games are: color match, follow the leader, catching frogs, finding bugs and playing hide and seek. Each mini-game is rewarded with jewelry, clothes and make-up. All these are necessary to win the fashion show.
