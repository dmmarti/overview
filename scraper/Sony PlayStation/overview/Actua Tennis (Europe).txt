Actua Tennis features the Actua Sports concept of a fully 3D environment with multiple camera views for both the action and the replays, and motion captured player actions. You can design your player and then put him to the test in a series of tournaments around the world. Drop, lob and smash shots are all on offer, as are singles and doubles matches for up to 4 human players. The former Australian tennis player Pat Cash provides the commentary.
