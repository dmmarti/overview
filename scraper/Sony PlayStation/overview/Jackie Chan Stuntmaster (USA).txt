Jackie's grandfather has been kidnapped. To rescue his grandfather, Jackie must find and deliver a package to the kidnappers.

You take control of Chan as he fights his way through 15 levels filled with thugs and goons. Luckily, Jackie is a Kung Fu master and has no problem with punches and kicks. You can also perform signature Jackie Chan moves like running up walls, cartwheel kicks, and even drunken Kung Fu. All of the moves are authentic, thanks to the motion-capture sessions with Jackie Chan himself.

In addition to barehanded moves, any item that is not nailed down can be used as a weapon, just like a Jackie Chan movie. Should you start to lose some life, pick up the milk, rice, and Chinese take-out scattered throughout the levels for some instant energy. Only Jackie Chan can save his grandfather.
