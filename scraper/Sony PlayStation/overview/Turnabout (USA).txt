In this game, the player is presented with a series of one hundred puzzles containing colored balls, colored target blocks and various obstacles, some static and some capable of movement.  Whenever two or more objects of the same color come into contact with each other, they disappear, and the object is to eliminate all of the colored balls and target blocks.  The trick to the game is that none of the pieces can be moved directly; the player's only options are to rotate the entire playing field either left or right ninety degrees and let gravity do the rest.  As a bonus, the game includes an editor which allows the player to create up to fifty additional levels to challenge friends with.
