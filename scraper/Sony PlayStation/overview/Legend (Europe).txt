Legend is the sequel to it's namesake for the SNES. Despite the conversion to 3D, the game still keeps all the action in a two dimensional plane.  The Kingdom of Tovakia is overtaken by chaos and despair. After several assassination attempts, the king's brother is sent into exile. During his exile, however, he learns the dark arts of sorcery. He summons a demon to support him in his quest to rule over Tovakia. When he manages to kidnap the king, it is up to the protagonists to save him, and Tovakia, from the evil brother.  You can choose to play one of three characters: Axel (all-round character), Tara (fast and good with light weapons) and Karo (slow but strong and good with heavy weapons).  You will find a wide array of weapons and enemies in this 3D Beat 'em Up. Besides the standard medieval weaponry there are various ranged spells you can use to hurt the enemy. There are five stages to play through and each stage ends with a level boss.  In multiplayer it is possible to play the game in two player co-op with increased difficulty.
