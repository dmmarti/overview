In the depths of New York City live two animal cop characters living out their own dreams (Firo, an orange ape and Klawd, an alley cat). But when counterfeit crimes push the city to its limits, the two must knock their differences to the side and clean up the mess that the other cops are yet to achieve. Includes a mix of Isometric platform action, and 1st person shoot 'em up stages, with plenty of laughs along the way.
