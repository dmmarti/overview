Will you dominate the field as world #1 Steve Edwars?  Or perhaps you'd prefer to challenge the top players as the up and coming Andy Legacy? Power Serve 3D Tennis is the first tennis game released for the PSX console and as the players' names show, it was not licensed.

Choose from eight different players and challenge the computer or a friend in this fully 3D tennis game. The player can determine the length of match, playing surface, and camera angle to suit the playing style. There is also an option of teaming up with a partner in doubles action. Full match statistics are available after each match.
