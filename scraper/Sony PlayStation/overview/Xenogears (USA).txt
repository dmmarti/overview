A war has been raging on the continent of Ignas between the Kislev Empire to the north and the kingdom of  Aveh in the south. It has gone for so long that people have forgotten the cause. As a mysterious organization called "Ethos" introduces an ancient technology in form of huge mega-robots, the tides are turning. A new army called "Gebler" is pulling the strings and supports Aveh to regain its authority over Kislev. 

A failed attempt to steal one of Kislev's new Gears, a giant robot named "Weltall", leads to a fight between a group of Gebler and Kislev guards in the remote town of Lahan in the outskirts of Aveh. One of the villagers, Fei Fong Wong, impulsively takes possession of "Weltall" and steers it to fight. As Fei's best friend Timothy is killed during the battle, he releases a massive wave of energy and destroys the whole village together with one of his close friends, Alice.

After this tragedy, Fei is blamed for the destruction of the village and the death of his friends. Pursued by military governments and mysterious forces Fei sets out on an epic quest for answers and his own forgotten past.

"Xenogears" is a traditional Asian RPG with an important new feature. There are two types of combat in the game: standard and gear. In standard combat, your characters fight with equipped weapons, learning and performing different combos that can be executed in one turn. But often you'll have to explore dungeons while piloting giant robots called "gears". Gear combat follows different rules: you perform moves until you run out of fuel, and must concentrate on finishing the enemy quickly. You can equip various accessories on your gears, including those that will let you partially restore your fuel. Gears cannot level up, but can be upgraded in workshops.
