This sequel to the original Destruction Derby offers more of the same no-holds-barred action and mayhem with new tracks and a lot of technical improvements and features not seen in the original, such as a pit stop feature that allows car repairs!

Gameplay is identical to its predecessor -- the objective consists of gaining points by winning races or "creatively" crashing opponents and climbing to the top of the rankings.
