F1 2000 was the last Visual Sciences' F1 racing game to appear on the PlayStation. With an official FIA Formula One license, it includes the full 2000 World Championship season, including the new US Indianapolis Grand Prix and the Jaguar Racing Team.

The game modes features a full championship, quick races, racing weekends, custom grid and time trial modes. In the multiplayer section, you can either go head to head in 2-player split screen sessions, or play a hot-seat time trial mode for up to 22 players.

All cars can be fine-tuned in the pits, and there is clear pit-to-car radio commentary. Full telemetry data is shown for detailed set-up changes. Your best performances can be saved in the replay mode, including race highlights. In this version, the computer opponents now have more realistic racing behaviour, as they make mistakes and have car failures.
