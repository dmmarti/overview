Sequel to Medievil.  Not as open ended to game advancement as the first, as instead of an adventure game it;s more of a action game in which you go through levels and when you win one you go back to a professers hide-out to collect the chalice and get weapons and such.
There are a large amount of mini-games, and the whole game is almost noting like the first, which is good or bad depending on your view.
