Bug Riders tries to put a new twist on the racing genre. You choose a character and his or her bug and race through six tracks that make up the "Great Race". 

Instead of having a normal accelerate button, you must crop your bug to make him go faster. But watch out, you don't want to overdo it because he will become angry and refuse to obey you. You can pull on the reins to slow down.

The six tracks are filled with shortcuts and power-up items, such as missiles and bombs to blast away your opponents.  You must fly through as many time rings as you can to add time to the clock or you won't be able to finish the race.
