All Star Watersports lets you 'Ride-the-barrel' through the most realistic waves yet seen on the PSone. Grab a surfboard, bodyboard, windsurfer or jet watercraft and carve up some of the most awesome surfing beaches along the coast. Play with the seagulls and dolphins as you master the skills required for each sport including barrel riding the surfboard, jibing the windsurfer, jumping the jet watercraft and spinning the bodyboard. You can compete against the computer, or up to four players can compete in contests including: 'Beach Competition', 'Big Air Contests' and 'Extreme Trick'. All Stars Watersports contains dynamic, variable size surf breaking waves ranging from the perfect 5 foot peeler to massive and angry reef breaks.
