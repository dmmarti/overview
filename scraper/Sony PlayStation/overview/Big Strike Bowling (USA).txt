Big Strike Bowling lets you hit the lanes as one of 9 characters. All of these characters can be costumised with unlockable clothes and accessories. You can access 4 lanes: Rockin' Lanes (classic), Hula Bowl (tropical), Starlight Bowl (space) and Alley Alley (back alley). You can play in four game modes: Open Bowl, Team Game, Tournament and Progressive Play.

The gameplay is very basic. You always play one-on-one against an opponent. To throw your ball, you first have to position your bowler towards the left or the right of .the alley. Using the shoulder buttons you can adjust the aiming arrow. Once you have stopped both the power and accuracy meter using the X button, you hopefully haven't thrown in the gutter.
