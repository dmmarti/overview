Test Drive Off-Road 3 is a off-road racing game that features 27 fully-licensed sport utility vehicles to race in (from manufacturers like Jeep, Nissan and Ford), with different attributes such as top speed, handling, acceleration and suspension.

The vehicles are customizable: you can change color, engine, tires, suspension and some special upgrades (which are purchased with credits earned after championship races).

There are 11 off-road tracks in different environments (forests, mountains, etc.), which can be raced in two game modes: Arcade (single-race) and World Tour (championship).

There is no multiplayer mode.

The music is played by signed artists such as Blink 182 and Incubus.
