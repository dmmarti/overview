Global Domination is an action-based strategical wargame that is based on the fictional game James Bond plays against Maximillian Largo in the 1983 film Never Say Never again. Elements of this game are combined with the classical board game Risk.  In this game you play as an agent for a secret agency called ULTRA. You are hired by countries all over the world to protect them from their enemies.  Each of the twenty missions begins with a full motion video briefing. After that you are presented with a spinning hologram globe representing the earth. The world is divided into different countries, similar to risk. It is your job to defend your country from incoming attacks and strike against enemies.  With your keyboard you can switch between weapons and you can aim with your mouse for a target location for your rockets, aircraft and naval vessels. More and more weapons come available as you progress in the game.
