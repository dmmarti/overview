Looney Tunes Racing is a kart-racing game for the PlayStation. There are some definite similarities between this title and Crash Team Racing, both in game play mechanics and depth. Completely immersed in the humor and soul of the Looney Tunes license, the player starts the game with only a handful of characters and levels available, but as the game proceeds features become unlocked including new characters, levels, and challenges.

Each character has an unique vehicle themed just for them, and is accompanied by voice taunts, provided by Warner Bros. licensed voice actors, and character-specific animations that help bring these characters to life.

The weapons the player can unleash onto the opponents include cherry bombs, homing cream pies, thunder clouds with devastating lightning bolts, and giant anvils that drop out of the sky. In addition, each uniquely themed level has a series of amusing booby traps and obstacles that the player can unleash to slow down your foes. The player can make boulders fall, launch giant boxing gloves on springs, and trample the opponents with sheep in the red-rock canyons, get spacecraft to fire lasers in the Martian level, and activate a huge, fat, white horse in the Opera stage to come in and trounce on the enemies. Even Gossamer, the large monster make entirely of red hair (except for those big white eyes and white tennis shoes), makes a cameo in the Gossamer’s castle level, as he comes right out onto the track to take out any oncoming traffic.

Beyond the races, other noteworthy game modes include the Multi-player Battle Mode, where the players basically pummel each other with wacky weaponry, and the ACME Challenges, which include challenges such as Boss Races (against Porky Pig, for example), picking up key items in a certain order, and others.
