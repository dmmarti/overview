Pool simulator which uses an entirely 3d enviroment and physics fine-tested by pro players. Following the tradition set in previous Virtual Pool games you get a pro host, this time Jeanette "Black Widow" Lee, who teaches you the basics of the game via some videos and also plays against you as the "boss" of the career mode. You can also play in tournaments or single games with 21 game variations to choose from, 8 venues and several tables ranging from amateur to championship which you can also customize by selecting their speed, pocket cut, etc.
Includes multiplayer support for up to 4 players.
