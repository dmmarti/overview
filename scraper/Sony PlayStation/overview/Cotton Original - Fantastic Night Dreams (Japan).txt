The Cotton series is a line of shoot 'em up video game software developed by Success with a long history of releases both in arcades and on home video game consoles. With the series debuting in 1991, the Cotton games have helped to establish the visual style of shoot 'em ups sometimes called cute 'em up. Instead of warships and battle fields typical of most shoot 'em ups, Cotton games put players in control of a witch riding on a broom and tasks them with fighting through magical haunted kingdoms. Cotton games have appeared on a variety of consoles including the NEC PC Engine/TurboGrafx-16, the Super Nintendo, the Mega Drive/Sega Genesis, the Sega Saturn, the PlayStation, the Neo Geo Pocket Color, and the Dreamcast. There is also a pachinko game featuring Cotton available for the PlayStation 2. Most recently, Cotton appears as a hidden character in the Nintendo DS game Rondo of Swords.
