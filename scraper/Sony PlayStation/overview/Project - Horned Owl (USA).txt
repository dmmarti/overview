Horned Owl is a rail-shooter that can take advantage of the PlayStation mouse or the Konami light gun. Three main characters are available. The levels are all city-based with multiple mech style enemies to dispatch. The game plays pretty quick as there are only five levels. Masamune Shirow, famous for the anime Ghost In The Shell, was involved with the character design.
