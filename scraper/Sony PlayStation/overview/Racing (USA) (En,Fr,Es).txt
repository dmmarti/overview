Racing as the title suggests is a simple racing game. It features both a short and a long distance race course, a mirrored version of the long course, plus different skill levels. Before a race begins, players select a car (out of 6 total), and then set whether they want automatic or manual transmission, and whether they want a drift or grip setting. 

Races have the player racing against 3 opponent racers. Players try to attain the fastest lap times and the fastest total race time while trying to defeat their opponents. The players fastest times can then be saved.

The game also contains a brief tutorial that explains the controls and some techniques of racing.
