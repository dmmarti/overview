As a young boy, you visited your grandfather's farm one summer, which was one of the best there was. Now, some years later, your grandfather has passed away and you inherited his farm, which is now in a state of disrepair. The Mayor of the village has given you three years to turn things around, and bring the farm back to a state that your grandfather would be proud of. At the same time, you must also think about dating and getting married to secure a place in the village. Roll up your sleeves and get ready to get dirty, because that farm needs help and you're the only one who can make it the best farm anyone's seen.
