Beat the pulp out of your opponent using this fantasy lineup of Capcom Street Fighter characters and Marvel X-Men comic book characters in this conversion of the arcade game.  The arcade giant returns with all of the characters and moves, with all the animation intact including the option to swap characters on the fly. This title required the 4 meg ram cart that shipped with it (although there were a few released without it), but once running, was practically arcade perfect. Zero loading times after the initial start-up load screen, and then instantly into the action.
