By the developers of the realistic Sony Formula One series, Formula One Arcade is also an officially licensed product, but the racing itself is unrealistic with many arcade elements. Players choose formula one cars and race other drivers on various courses, checkpoint-based with the clock counting down. Unlike the other games in the series however, the racing is very hectic and there are power-ups such as speed boosts, shields (invincibility), large tires (more grip) and more.
