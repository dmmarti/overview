One of the earliest in the Shutokou Battle series, where the player took control of 12 different cars and 60 different parts and upgrades available to choose from.

There are a variety of tracks to choose from, all recreated to resemble actual Tokyo roads and highways and featured the "Drift" button that allowed the player to take a turn faster. Players can also earn points through this action as well as from winning races to upgrade their car and go head-to-head against the computer or against three CPU opponents.

Keiichi Tsuchiya, a racing champion from Tokyo and Masaaki Bando, a top automotive expert from Japan both lent their expertise to the game to ensure authentic handling and physics for each game that was rendered in the game.
