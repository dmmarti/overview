The third and currently the latest game in the Pajama Sam Series, part of the Humongous' 
popular "Junior Adventure" titles designed for children ages three to eight. 

You're playing Sam who once again assumes the role of Pajama Sam at times when he needs
facing his fears. This time you suddenly find yourself in the midst of a food squabble 
when you try to chase down some snickering cookies! And you are called to find the 4 
missing delegates of MopTop Island's emergency peace conference that has to be made to 
calm the island population after the incident of the fats and the sweets. They are both 
forcing the healthy foods off of the island.

Pajama Sam 3 takes place in front of beautifully hand-drawn interactive backgrounds where 
each screen has a multitude of fun things to click on like Humongous' other adventures.
There are also some mini-games within the main game to catch more of the player's attention.
The main mini-game is to collect 20 tops from Sam's favorite Chocamok cookie boxes so that
he could get a "Pajama Man Action Figure with Titanic Elbow Thrust"! You usually come
across these boxes since they could be hidden anywhere around the island.

Children are invited to learn healthful food awareness, listening and decision-making 
skills and other educational concepts and lessons in the game. Along their journey, 
they can interact more than 20 different comic-style characters, like a gentle doughnut 
who can help Sam find the way on the water or a professional entertainer called Mickey
Hollandaise who can get the audience into hysterics with his big shoes!
