Endorsed by skating bible Thrasher magazine, this game attempts to capture the spirit, style, and skill of the renegade freestyle street-skating culture. Choose from several skaters, pick an outfit, and then select from one of 12 skateboarding locations, including the Brooklyn Bridge banks or L.A.'s Santa Monica Courthouse. These and other concrete temples are all based on real-life locations.

There are more than 100 tricks to master, which is necessary if you want to unlock secret levels or outrun the donut-eating cops. In addition, each environment is interactive. For example, you will see leaves fall from a tree if you happen to hit it. Of course, you can also interact with objects to show off your skating skills.

Features a hip hop soundtrack, also.
