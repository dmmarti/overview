This was Hasbro's second attempt at recreating the popular game show Wheel of Fortune on home computers. There are 2500 puzzles to work through, and a full roster of prizes. Against-the-clock bonus rounds are also included. You can also attempt an equivalent of the exam given to would-be contestants. Backstage video clips are included, and successful players will unlock interviews with glamorous hostess Vanna White.
