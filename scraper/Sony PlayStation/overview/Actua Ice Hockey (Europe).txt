Another sport was added to the Actua series in this license of the Ice Hockey component of the 1998 Winter Olympics. You can choose from any of the leading teams and attempt to lead them to glory, starting from the qualifiers, with friendly matches (surely a misnomer in the tough world of Ice Hockey) and a practice mode also on offer. Players are motion-captured, and the action can be viewed from multiple camera angles. Paul Ferguson provides a running commentary, and full replays are provided.
