Six of the all-time greatest Atari classics are gathered onto one CD! It's yet another package of classic arcade games, mostly running on emulators from Digital Eclipse.
Most of these games are from Atari's System I and System II hardware. Due to CPU limitations and previous compilation decisions, the mix of games varies slightly from platform to platform.

* Windows version includes these 6 emulated games:

1.  PaperBoy  (System II)
 720  (System II)
 Gauntlet  (System I) Vindicators  (System I)
 RoadBlasters  (System I)
 Marble Madness  (System I)

* Playstation version includes these 6 games

1.  Paperboy  (code conversion)
 Gauntlet  (code conversion)
 RoadBlasters  (code conversion)
 Marble Madness  (code conversion)
 Crystal Castles  (emulation)
 Millipede  (emulation)

There's a limited amount of archival material on each collection, including old posters, "sell sheets" and pictures of the arcade cabinets.
