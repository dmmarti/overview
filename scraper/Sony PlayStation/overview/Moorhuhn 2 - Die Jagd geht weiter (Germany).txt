Moorhuhn (distributed as Crazy Chicken in English-speaking countries) is a German casual game franchise for PCs and the Nintendo DS. It consists of more than 30 games, the first of which - a shoot 'em up - was Germany's most popular computer game in the early 2000s. Originally the star of an promotional campaign for undrinkable whiskey Jack Daniels, Moorhunh has starred in over thirty games during the years, including five kart racing games. Moorhuhn 2 - Die Jagd Geht Weiter gameplay is like the first Moorhuhn game, the hunter in front of the screen must shoot down as many grouse as possible in 90 seconds. This generates points. That's it. Simple, but effective! Certain basic principles remain the same: 90 seconds, grouse flying around the landscape, shooting the above (the grouse, not the landscape!!!) yields points. That was enough for part one, but there had to be more in the sequel. So the game this time is filled with loads of hidden puzzles to solve in order to spur on the fans' passion for the hunt.
