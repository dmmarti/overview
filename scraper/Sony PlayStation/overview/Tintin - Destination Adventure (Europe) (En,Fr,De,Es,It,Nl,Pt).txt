The popular European comic book character, TinTin, has his first game in 3D. TinTin is at a presentation of Professor Calculus' new invention, which isn't working as usual.  His dog Snowy falls asleep and dreams about their past wild adventures. The story is based on 5 books: The Black Island, Red Rackham’s Treasure, Land of Black Gold, Explorers on the Moon, and Flight 714. 

TinTin and Snowy are the major characters in the game through over 20 levels with a boss at the end of each one as well as bonus games. You'll travel to varied locations such as the desert, an exotic island and even the moon. Levels feature races on a boat, plane, jeep, and underwater shark submarine as well as some standard platform gameplay. Tintin is capable of a rather broad variety of movements like: to walk, run, jump, balance himself, grip and climb. It is also possible for him: to scare away certain animals and to capture enemies using the flash of his camera, to use his fists, and to throw chloroform bottles to neutralize certain characters. Another part of the play is to collect parts of a statue of Snowy which will give access to bonus levels if these are all  collected.
