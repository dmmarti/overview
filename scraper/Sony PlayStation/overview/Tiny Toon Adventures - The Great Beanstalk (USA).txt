In Tiny Toon Adventures: The Great Beanstalk, you play as the pint-sized cartoon star Plucky Duck. 

The game is a wacky fairy-tale-gone-wrong, in which you explore eight different areas in a scavenger hunt based on nursery rhymes. 

With Buster Bunny bouncing along at your side and Babs Bunny providing helpful clues, you attempt to make your way up the titular beanstalk. When you obtain an item you've been asked to find, you receive part of a key; get all three parts of a key and you get the chance to steal a valuable prize from the mysterious giant. 

Prizes include the goose that laid the golden eggs and a fabled, priceless harp. Your comical quest takes you through classic nursery rhyme locations based on &quot;Little Red Riding Hood,&quot; &quot;The Three Bears,&quot; &quot;Old Mother Hubbard&quot; and more.
