You've been sitting still for an hour, waiting for something to move. Suddenly, about 20 yards out, you see your prey. Get the deer in your sights and pull the trigger in this realistic hunting trip for the PSX. You'll be tracking Blacktail, Whitetail, Desert Mules, Sitka Deer, Fallow Deer, and more throughout the game's six expansive areas. Choose the time-intensive "Mission" mode, or enjoy the arcade-style play of "Quick Play." Variable weather conditions are among the many challenges you'll face in ULTIMATE DEER HUNT.
