A console version of Backyard Soccer based on the MLS Edition minus the MLS license, the game mechanics mostly follow that of the computer versions -- pick a field, pick a team name and colors, and choose who you want to be on your team. You may also play through a season. Although it may sound like the same game, the ball physics and player movement is entirely different from the PC/Macintosh versions. It can be seen as less realistic; the players and ball move far more stiffly than in the computer versions.
