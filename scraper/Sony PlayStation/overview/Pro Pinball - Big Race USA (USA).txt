The table included in this pinball game has a taxi theme attached to it. As you slam the ball around the screen, you can pick up passengers, drive around USA, and get bonus points through mini games, all related to taxi driving. Even the dot matrix screen gets a say in the action, where you must crash into as many cars as possible as you drive your passenger to his/her destination, all in the name of points of course.
