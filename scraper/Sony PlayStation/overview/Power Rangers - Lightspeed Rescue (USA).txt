Power Rangers: Lightspeed Rescue for PlayStation is one of several games based on the 2000 incarnation of the long-running TV franchise. This version lets the Power Rangers defend Mariner Bay against the minions of the evil Queen Bansheera in a 3D beat'em up.  The game consists of six regular plus one hidden level, with such featured environments as an office building, a dam, the top of a moving train and more. Players can select from the five different Lightspeed Rangers, who each have varying stats for energy, strength and speed and a unique special attack. The game uses 3D polygonal graphics with the camera emulating an isometric viewpoint. The goals in each area include rescuing hostages and beating up bad guys. Updates via comlink from Captain Mitchell and Miss Fairweather keep players posted on story developments and new goals.  To defeat the various enemies, the controls allow for punches, kicks and jumps (which can be chained into combos) as well as blocks. To use a ranger's special power, the appropriate meter must be filled by picking up colored crystals. The powers include a targeted beam, a ground-shaking hit, multi-target somersaults and more. Other pick-ups besides the crystals include health refills and short-time invincibility. Each level includes various bosses with large health bars to pummel down. In some levels, the rangers need to transform into their Megazord mech form to defeat the final boss.  Live-action clips from the TV show set the scene between levels and the actors from the show lend their voices to the game as well. The game features a two-player mode that allows two rangers to take on the enemies at the same time.
