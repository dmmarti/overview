Because of international conflicts and new dangers due to terrorist attacks the Air Force needed to construct a new warplane which can be uses for multiple roles like frontal attacks or stealth operations. The result: a mixture between the YF-23's (high performance airframe), the X- 31's (thrust-vectoring maneuverability), and the F-111's (superior terrain and weapon-guidance systems).

In Agile Warrior: F-111X the player pilots one of these aircraft to solve the mentioned issues in about six missions. To be successful he needs to utilize all of the aircraft's features, e.g. rockets, a radar which uncovers nearby enemies or the ability to cloak. The latter is important during the stealth missions in which the player needs to avoid hostile radars.
