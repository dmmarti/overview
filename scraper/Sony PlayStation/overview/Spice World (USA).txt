This game was released when they were at the peak of their success and before Geri left! 

Choose your favourite Spice Girl and use samples from their songs to create your own great song. The next stage is to practice your dance moves. The final stage is to put both together and all 5 Spice Girls rehearse for their live show. Control who dances which moves and the camera views.

The game is interspersed with FMV footage of the girls.
