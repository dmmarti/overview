NBA ShootOut 2003 offers three separate game modes: Exhibition, Season, and Playoff. Exhibition mode allows any two NBA teams to be selected to play one game against each other. With Season mode, gamers can lead their favorite team through a full (or shortened) NBA regular season and playoffs. During this season, gamers can make trades, check stats, and find out about league news. In Playoff mode, gamers go directly to the NBA Playoffs, where they can customize which 16 teams will compete for the NBA Finals. For special features, NBA ShootOut 2003 once again allows gamers to create their own NBA superstar with the Create Player feature. Additionally, in the Create Dunk mode, gamers can design their own high-flying dunks. In the gameplay department, NBA ShootOut 2003 returns many of its features from previous installments. The game features signature dunks, artificial intelligence, and actual NBA plays. To make controls easier on players, NBA ShootOut 2003 offers 18 one-touch player commands. The game also features the Total Control option to simplify gameplay. Total Control can be used for passing, shooting, and screening. Finally, ShootOut 2003 offers icon passing and icon defense -- where gamers can instantly pass to a specific player on offense or switch to a specific defender on defense. This is accomplished by pressing the button that corresponds with the symbol above the intended player's head.
