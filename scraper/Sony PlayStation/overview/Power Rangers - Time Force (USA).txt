In this game based on the TV show with the same name, you pick your favorite Power Ranger and fight your way through several levels in various eras in time to stop the evil Ransik and his Cyclobot minions from messing with the world's time line, and stealing historical artifacts.  The game plays like a fighter game with platform elements, and every now and then you get to control a Zord and fight one-on-one with more powerful enemies.
