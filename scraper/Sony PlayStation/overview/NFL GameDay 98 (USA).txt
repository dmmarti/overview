NFL GameDay '98 has new and previous features like Preseason, Season, and Training Camp modes. You can also choose to play as a skill player, like wide receiver or fullback instead of mostly being in control of the quarterback. You also get a play editor, a create-a-player feature, and over 100 touchdown dances.
