Test Drive Off-Road 2 follows the path set by 1997's Test Drive: Off-Road as you drive across twelve courses (based on six locales: Morocco, Hawaii, Mojave, Santa Cruz, Switzerland and Wales) in your quest to win races on the World Tour. This time twenty vehicles are available to choose from, but before you can get behind the wheel, you'll have to purchase them with credits earned from winning races. Some of the licensed vehicles include a Hummer, Dodge Ram, Jeep Wrangler, Ford Explorer, Jeep Cherokee, Range Rover, Ford F-150 and a Dodge T-Rex. The World Tour consists of five events divided by class: Hummer, Safari, SUV (Sport Utility Vehicle), Truck and Military. Each class has you competing against five similar vehicles in a series of races, where you'll need to place within the top three in order to advance to the next track. Win the class and you'll not only unlock certain courses, but move one step closer to participating in the Open Class. In order to access this final event, you'll have to place first in all five races comprising the World Tour. Notable features include Dual Shock Analog Controller support, three difficulty settings for single races, your choice of automatic or manual transmission, multiple controller configurations and memory card support to save top scores. As in the original, an alternative soundtrack will accompany you while racing, including tracks from such artists as Gravity Kills, Sevendust and Fear Factory.
