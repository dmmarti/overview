A football management game from the creators of the Kick Off series. Player Manager 2000 lets you coach any team from England, Scotland, Italy and Germany, and there is totally more than 30,000 players. Tactical options are diverse, and the game features pre- and post-match analysis.

What makes the game relatively individual is that you are able to put yourself in the team. There are three ways to play the matches, the first is the commentary mode that works almost the same way as the Championship Manager games. The second is the scanner mode where you watch the matches from a 2D top-down view. The third is to play them in full 3D similar to the FIFA games.
