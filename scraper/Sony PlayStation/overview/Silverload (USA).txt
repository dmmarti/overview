Somewhere in the Old West lies Silverload, an old mining time. It has once been a vibrant, silver boom-town, but now it has become a ghost town, surrounded by perpetual storms. The town’s decline has started with a disastrous earthquake, but it may also be caused by an Indian curse, because the mine was built on land sacred to the Skaedi tribe. 
You play the part of a bounty hunter who has been hired by the people of Silverload to find one of their children. The parents claim that it is kidnapped by "the monsters of Silverload". If you survive long enough, you will discover the town’s dreadful secret. 
Silverload is a 3rd POV, inventory-based point and click adventure that belongs to the genre of horror adventures. It  includes a few arcade sequences: from time to time the player will become involved in gun fights. Silverload was originally developed for the Sony PlayStation.
