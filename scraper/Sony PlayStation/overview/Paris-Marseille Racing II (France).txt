Take control of your DeLorian, police car, Mini or Beetle and race through some of France's most famous (and busiest) roads and cities. With tournament, time attack and single race modes, the game allows you to race within three classes, in each of which you must place first. Your reward is cash to upgrade the numerous cars available with enhanced engines, tires and even a nitro boost.

Paris-Marseille is France's entry in Davilex's "Racer" series, alongside Autobahn Raser II in Germany, A2 Racer in Holland and London Racer in the UK.
