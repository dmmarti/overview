Released three years after Tom Clancy's Rainbow Six, Tom Clancy's Rainbow Six: Lone Wolf is more a standalone add-on than a new game. The story takes place after the events of Tom Clancy's Rainbow Six.

The player is Ding Chavez, a member of the Rainbow Team, who is sent to Norway to infiltrate a terrorist group that illegally imports weapons.
Changes are: 

1. Improved graphic engine
Eight new weapons
No more team work: Chavez is the Lone Wolf, and has to succeed on his own
Improved controls ergonomy, taking advantage of the analog Dual Shock Controller
