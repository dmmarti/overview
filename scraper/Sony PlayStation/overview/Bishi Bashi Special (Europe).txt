Bishi Bashi Special is a compilation (and conversion) of the Konami arcade titles Bishi Bashi Champ, Super Bishi Bashi Champ and Handle Champ.

Gameplay is made up of tons of mini games, all of which use a simple 3-button interface that mimics the arcade originals. The mini games encompass a wide variety of button-mashing, timing and button combination games. The games themselves can be anything from making hamburgers, throwing a pie down a church aisle to balancing a car on a floating narrow gravel road and much more.

The game can be played alone, vs a computer player or play up to eight people using a multi-tap and three controllers.
