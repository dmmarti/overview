Big Ol' Bass 2 is the third part in the Fisherman's Bait series. The game is known as Fisherman's Bait 3 in Europe and Exciting Bass 3 in Japan. Again there are more than fifteen different types of fish, twenty holes and many different lures. Even more exotic fictional fish make their way in the World Monster Fishing mode. The new Surival mode allows you to partake in a knock-out system. Two player splitscreen is supported against a friend or AI.
