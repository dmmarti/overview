As in the first game, Die Hard Trilogy 2 is broken up into three types of gameplay: shootin', drivin', and runnin' around. The game can be played either in Movie mode, which manages to tell what little story there is while alternating between gameplay types, or Arcade mode, which lets you pound through all of the shooting or driving levels at once (complete with extra bonus levels).
