K-1 Grand Prix is a kickboxing game featuring 32 real K-1 fighters.

The game features a 1 player K-1 Kings mode, where the player picks a fighter and faces off against a series of computer controlled fighters, and another mode which is the 2 player K-1 Hercules mode. There is also the K-1 Grand Prix mode which has 16 fighters competing in a tournament to be the K-1 champion.

The K-1 Challenge lets the player create a fighter. Players get to choose their fighters build type, skin color, color of their trunks, nationality, and a gym to train at which best reflects the fighting style they want. Players get to choose a trainer and 2 sub trainers to help condition them to become a fighting machine. To condition, the player selects a variety of exercises like jumping rope or using a medicine ball for their fighter to train in. Training builds up the fighters statistics and also earns them training points which can then be spent on moves such as uppercuts and hooks. Eventually after training for a while, the player will be challenged by a rival and they can choose to accept the challenge or decline if they feel they aren't ready yet and need more training. This mode takes the player's fighter through 8 years of his career trying to become a K-1 champion.

Training mode lets the player practice their moves with a sparring partner.
Finally, the Ring Side mode lets the player observe a match between 2 computer controlled fighters.

Options include setting the number of rounds, the number of downs, how fast the rounds are, whether to have English or Japanese voice types, the difficulty level of the opponent fighters, and whether to turn vibration on or off.
