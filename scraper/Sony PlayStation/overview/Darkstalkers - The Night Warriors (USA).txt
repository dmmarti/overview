Darkstalkers: The Night Warriors is one of Capcom's 2D one-on-one fighting classics.

Select one of many fighters, each based on a classic monster (vampire, werewolf, golem, zombie, succubus, mummy, catwoman, oni, merman, sasquatch, robot, alien.)  and duke it out in various horror-themed locales.

Each character is well defined with lots of obvious character design having gone into each.  Gameplay is the standard Capcom 2D style, with combos and special moves being important to master.
