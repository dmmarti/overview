Number 4, and now there are a few un-familiar titles bundled together:

Pac-Land: Much like classic Mario and Sonic games, this was the first Pac-Man game to leave the familiar top down puzzle genre, in exchange for a side scrolling platform game. And, of course, Pac-Man is the star.

Assault: Simply put this is Xevious with tanks, as that is what you control in another of the many top down shooters that Namco are famous for.

Genpeitoumaden: Most will never have heard of this one. You play a Samurai who must hack his way through many side-scrolling levels of monsters.

Ordyne: Back to the shooters, hear you win cash and spend on powerups and the like, which added something new to the genre at the time.

And finally theres The Return of Ishtar, which is a simple top down adventure game.
