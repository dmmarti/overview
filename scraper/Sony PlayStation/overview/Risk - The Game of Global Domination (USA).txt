Risk is a conversion of the classic board game of the same name. Your aim is to wipe out your opponents and conquer the world by placing your armies and attacking neighbouring territories. The CD-ROM version of Risk features an exact conversion of the Classic board game against human or AI opponents, as well as Ultimate Risk, a more complex game where a completely new strategy is needed, involving Generals, forts and different terrain types.

Other features include new maps, the challenging Blind Risk, fully animated battle scenes and a second CD to allow easy network gaming.
