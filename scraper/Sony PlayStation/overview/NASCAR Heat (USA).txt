NASCAR HEAT has four different modes of play to choose from, based on the 2000 NASCAR Winston Cup Season. 
The game offers Single Race and Championship Season. These modes allow the player to choose their favorite driver and race against a full field of cars at one or all of the NASCAR tracks. Race the Pro and Beat the Heat Challenge are two modes of play that separate this product from the competition. Beat the Heat provides the player with a number of challenges designed around scenarios that actually occur in NASCAR. These challenges deal with everything from the best way to pass at a particular track, to pit strategy for tire changes. Race the Pro offers the player the opportunity to race against Laps actually driven by some of NASCAR's biggest stars.
