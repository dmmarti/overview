A classic shooter with a twist. Aliens have invaded the Martian Colonies and reprogrammed the mining robots into killers. Earth, fearing an invasion, creates the Machine Hunters. They wear special suits that allow them to reprogram and take over the robots on contact. The trick is learning to control 9 different types of robots to fight the other robots. There are many different worlds to explore as you locate and battle the robots. All of the worlds let you teleport to different locations on the planets.
