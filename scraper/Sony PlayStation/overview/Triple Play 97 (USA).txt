Many of the features that players have come to expect in a baseball game are featured in this early edition of the Triple Play series.

A manager mode that allows players to be traded just like in real baseball is included.  Since the game is licensed by the MLB and players associations, it has all the teams and players of the 1997 season.

Game modes include exhibition, series play, all-star playoffs, and full and partial season play - in which players also sustain injuries and go on hot and cold streaks. The Home Run Derby is an additional feature.
