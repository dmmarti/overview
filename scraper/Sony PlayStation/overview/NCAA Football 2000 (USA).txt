NCAA Football 2000 is a continuation of EA Sports' NCAA Football series, about college American football games. This version has polygon-rendered graphics, which were absent from previous NCAA Football offerings on the PlayStation.

All 23 bowl games and the Heisman Trophy are featured in Dynasty Mode. It contains 114 Division I-A schools and 26 from Division I-AA along with the option to create a custom team, along with logos and fight songs. There are also 23 bowls (for more than the previous game) and the ability to edit new plays. The game offers the Nokia Sugar Bowl as a unique stadium.
