There is a disturbance in the force, and the Jedi are there to find its source. There is a whole Armada of Battleships and troops besieging a planet and two Jedi knights come to protect the planet.

This Star Wars title from Lucas Arts is completely based on the movie Phantom Menace. It is basically an action game in which you play a number of characters from the movie, solve a number of puzzles, beat down enemies with your light saber or laser guns and follow the footsteps of the movie. But remember, you will follow a different trail to the same ultimate ending.
