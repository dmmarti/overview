Gameplay consists of two fighters inside a ring trying to knockout each other within three rounds by using various martial arts. If no one is knocked out by then, the fight is decided by a decision which is calculated by the score each fighter received. The score is derived from how well each fighter performed throughout the entire fight.

Players have to pay attention to three different meters while fighting.
A life gauge for that measures physical strength; a stamina gauge that decreases as each fighter uses a move; and a knockdown gauge to show the amount of damage each fighter has received.
