Chill is designed to be the first game that accurately recreates the rush associated with flinging a fragile human body mounted on a half-centimetre thick piece of fibre glass down the side of a death-trap mountain slope. It combines speed, tricks and death-defying jumps into the most exciting, fast-paced game for a long time.   With five different mountains and four different boarders, each with a choice of twenty one different boards, the player will be allowed to play the game their way. The player can take gentle runs down the beginner slopes or scream down the extreme slopes a hairs-breadth from the ultimate wipe-out.
