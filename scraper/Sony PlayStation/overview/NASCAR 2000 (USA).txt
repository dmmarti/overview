This NASCAR stock car racing simulation is a sequel of sorts to NASCAR Revolution. The game features 18 real world tracks plus several fantasy road courses, and 30 active NASCAR drivers plus some "legend" drivers.

Game modes include quick races, full weekend events, a full or abridged championship series, a Race Against the King mode where you race against Richard Petty in a series of events, and multiplayer support for up to 4 players. Updated physics and AI help the game aim for more realism.
