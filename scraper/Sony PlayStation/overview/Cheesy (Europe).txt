CTA's first venture on the Playstation was a platform style game which incorporated several first person elements.  Cheesy the mouse (and the star of the game) has been captured by a mad scientist for his genetic experiments. However, mohawked aliens attack the castle and in the commotion cheesy escapes. He has to navigate through 24 levels of mutated creatures, fight huge spiders, balance a mine cart through derelict tracks and escape flames inside a burning chimney.
