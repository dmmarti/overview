Bass Landing is a fishing game that has a tutorial mode, a free fishing mode, and a B.A.S (Bass Angler's Society) Pro-Tournament mode. In the tutorial mode, players go to fishing classes and learn and practice the basics of fishing starting with casting all the way down to bass ecology. At the end of all the classes the player is given an exam testing them on all they have previously learned. Free fishing mode let's the player fish at their leisure, letting them choose from 5 different lakes and setting its' conditions to their liking, and let's them attempt to catch any of the 14 species of fish that inhabit those lakes. The B.A.S Pro-Tournament mode has the player competing in 7 different tournaments by catching a set number of the most heaviest bass in a set amount of time.

Before heading out to fish the player can choose their type of rod, reel, lure, and line. When fishing the player chooses the way to cast their line, use a power meter to determine how far out the line is cast, and then hope to lure a fish on to their hook.

Options in the game let the player decide things such as the time scale, rod action, and indicator type. Their is also a record option that keeps track of all the data about the various fish that have been caught in the free fishing and tournament modes. The player can also save replays of the catches that they deem to be noteworthy.
