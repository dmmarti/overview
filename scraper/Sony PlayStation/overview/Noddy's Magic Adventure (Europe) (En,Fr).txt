Journey into this magical adventure with Noddy to search for the Wizards' missing magic wand. Help Noddy discover the mystery of the strange happenings in Toyland - can he get the wand back from those naughty goblins who are casting mischievous spells? The racing cars are driving by themselves! Help Noddy drive in his car close enough to the speeding cars and say a magic spell to stop them. The goblins have taken all the batteries out of the robots and now they don't work. Put the batteries back in so the robots can continue building a space rocket. The goblins made the balls bounce high in the sky - and stay there! Fly in the aeroplane and use some magic dust to bring them down to earth again. Step-stone across the stream to rescue Bumpy Dog after the goblins turned the bridge into Jelly with the magic wand. Use the stones to cross the stream.
