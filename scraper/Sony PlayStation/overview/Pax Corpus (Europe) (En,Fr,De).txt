In the game you play an attractive female mercenary who knows little about her own past. You've been hired to discover the secrets surrounding Corporation Alcyon's Pax Corpus Project, and eliminate any threat it poses to the free world.

Pax Corpus' gameplay revolves around shooting, weapon upgrades, and level progression through the acquisition of key-cards. Rave-style music accompanies the player throughout the futuristic world of violence.
