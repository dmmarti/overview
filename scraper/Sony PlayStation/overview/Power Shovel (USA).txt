Power Shovel is an arcade/simulation where you get to drive excavators of various sizes to do more or less realistic tasks. These include; digging holes, loading sand on trucks, tearing down old buildings, destroying abandoned cars and serving soup in a restaurant (using the scoop as a soup ladle), and many more.  There are a few different modes in the game you can choose from, like "License king" where you earn your driver's license. "Arcade king" is where you do will spend most of the time, since it's where most of the games are. As you progress through the many timed games you earn money, which you use to unlock special features like extra credits, photo galleries and sound effects.
