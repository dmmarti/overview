You control a young man named Eon who must save the world of Granstream.  After a great war, the planet was covered in nothing but water.  The continents were then magically made to float in the air.  The floating continents are now slowly sinking, and Eon must save them from doing so.

The Granstream Saga is a fairly linear RPG with an action based battle system.  The game is supposedly the first fully 3D RPG for the PlayStation, and it also features anime cutscenes.  The Granstream Saga debuted at #1 in Japan.
