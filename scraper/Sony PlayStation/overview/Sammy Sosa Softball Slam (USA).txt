For people who think Sammy Sosa's High Heat Baseball is too hard... This is a title from 3DO that uses the same engine, but in a much more down-to-earth manner playing softball. Edit/customize the team players. Choose different playing fields (from backyard to a stadium.) Practice, play a single game or a tournament against seven other teams. If you're good, maybe you'll get to play Sammy's Slammers for the championship...
