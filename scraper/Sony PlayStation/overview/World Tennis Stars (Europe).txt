The volleying action in World Tennis Stars happens on six fantasy courts: grass, beach, stone courtyard, disco, Mayan temple, and New York street. Each of the six characters has a full complement of forehands, backhands, volleys, and lobs. Strengths vary from character to character, though. In Arcade mode, you battle the computer in one-off matches. In Competition mode, you go through each court in turn, competing against the other characters to win a place in the final. During play, the screen scrolls to the player returning the ball, so there are times when your tennis star may go out of view. When this happens, a pointer lets you know where to reposition him or her for the return volley. Features: •Choose from 6 characters, each with a full set of moves - Forehands, backhands, volleys and lobs •Go up against the computer in one-off matches in Arcade Mode -- or work your way through the ranks in Competition Mode
