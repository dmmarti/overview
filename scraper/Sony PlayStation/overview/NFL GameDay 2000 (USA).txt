In addition to all the features you expect from this series, this version of GameDay includes one-handed grabs, diving into the end zone, and running out of bounds and slamming into the coach.  With a multitap controller, seven players can play at the same time. Also new in this edition of the series is the addition of a play editor and general manager mode.  With the play editor you can select patterns for your receivers and running backs as if you were the offensive coordinator.  In general manager mode, you can play through multiple seasons with one team, cut players, sign free agents, make trades, and even draft players.  Also new this year is the ability to play through an entire game as a player other than the quarterback.
