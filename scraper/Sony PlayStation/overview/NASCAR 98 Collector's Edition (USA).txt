This collector's edition celebrates the 50th anniversary of NASCAR. The game is completely identical to NASCAR 98, except that Darlington has been added to the list of tracks and the racing legend Richard Petty has been added to the driver's roster, along with the obvious cover art changes. The game also comes with a NASCAR 50th anniversary key chain.
