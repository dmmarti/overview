Strikers 1945 is a 2D side-scrolling shooter with a WWII theme. Use basic weaponry and many power-ups for real and not-so-real aircraft from the age. To keep in sync with the arcade version, the game is viewed in a letterbox format. The US version of the game is a port of the arcade game Strikers 1945 II. The Japanese PlayStation version of the game is entirely different, as it includes the port of Strikers 1945 but was also released with the PSX title Strikers 1945.
