Dirt Jockey lets the players operate heavy machinery like dump trucks, wheel loaders, bulldozers and high-reaching cranes. There are four game modes: Qualification (play this to obtain licenses for operating specific machinery), Build (the goal is to build a huge Department store with the licensed machinery), Equipment Rodeo (challenge yourself to the events of Treasure hunt, Mountain maker, Overdrive and Spin touch), and Free-play (self-explanatory). The game boasts realistic machinery controls and authentic looks.
