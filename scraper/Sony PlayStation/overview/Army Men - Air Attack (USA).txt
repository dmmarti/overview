Much like Army Men: Air Tactics, except in full 3D. You must pick up any lost Army Men, or shoot down enemy helicopters and ground forces to allow you fellow troops to push forward.

You start with the Huey, with the Chinook, the Super Stallion, and the Apache opening up in later levels. You can also fight it out with a friend in a multiplayer mode, or you can join forces in a co-op mode, and save you fellow troops together.
