A twinkling consciousness became a star that sparkled in the night and banished the darkness. The Mana Goddess acquired consciousness by gazing into the light of that sun. She made Fa´Diel, a great land, but so far an empty one.

In Legend of Mana you control a hero or heroine traveling over the land of Fa’Diel. The game features a land creation system, allowing you to create new locations and story elements by placing mysterious artifacts. Those ancient artifacts are repositories of the land´s long-forgotten memories and the many events that once took place there. As the game advances, you will receive more artifacts and find out more about the land. At home you can raise pet monsters and create powerful golems, forge mighty weapons or refine musical instruments. On your adventures you can meet various interesting characters and fight against gruesome monsters.

The game is extremely non-linear in terms of gameplay. You can explore areas in any order and play through 67 related scenarios. Eventually you will resurrect the Mana Tree and discover the Legend of Mana.
