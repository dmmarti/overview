XTAL has been defeated and the hackers responsible rounded up. However, the leader of the hackers reveals that the group have also unleashed a second artificial intelligence into the data library, known as EVE. The player must take control of one of EVE's attack programs and use them to destroy the other guard programs and then EVE herself.

The first sequel to the early Play Station fighter  Zero Divide features all new higher resolution graphics and higher poly models than the original game.

It adds two new robots, the nurse like Pixel and the crab like Cancer along with a few new bosses and hidden characters.

It adds a variety of different shaped and new arena types (the original game only had standard square arenas) from completely walled in ones to ones with low barriers that the opponent can be juggled over to lead to a ring out.

Rounds are now considerably shorter and the robot's armour easier to knock off. But on the whole, it really does play pretty much the same as the original game.
