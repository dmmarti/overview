Rox is a classically styled puzzle game which is at first look very reminiscent of Tetris, Dr. Mario, or Sega's Columns. The puzzle pieces in Rox are standard (six-sided) dice. Dice of different number values fall from the top of the screen for the player to arrange in place before they hit the bottom. One die must be matched with another of the same number value, aligned so that an additional number of dice equal to that number value are between the two matching die. The game becomes faster and more challenging as the player progresses.
