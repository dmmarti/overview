In Crossroad Crisis you have to help a chicken get home to his family.    The game is somewhat similar to Pipe Mania. The playing field is a 6x6 grid over a pond, and you have to move around and rotate tiles so that the chicken doesn't fall into the water. Each tile is a part of the path that the chicken will walk. They come in these different shapes: curved road, straight road and crossroad. In total there's 10 stages in the game. A stage is completed when you have cleared a number of tiles (which increases for each stage). The tiles will be cleared when the chicken walks over two or more tiles of the same color. Once the clear quota has been reached, a buoy will be placed on the playing field. To end the stage you have to put the buoy at the end of the path so that the chicken can walk into it.
