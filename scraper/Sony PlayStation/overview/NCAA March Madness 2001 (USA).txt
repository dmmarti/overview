This is the fourth in Electronic Arts' college basketball franchise. The game has most of the features from the 2000 edition like exhibition and tournament games, women's teams and Dynasty Mode. New features for the 2001 edition include Coach Mode, where you build your career until you land a job with a Division I team by achieving certain goals like finishing a season with a winning record or defeating several ranked teams. There's also a Dream Tournament, featuring the 64 greatest teams of all time. You can also earn new Dynamic Ball Control moves, like crossovers and dunks, by unlocking them as your skills progress. The game features design input from legendary Blue Devils coach Mike "Coach K" Krzyzewski.
