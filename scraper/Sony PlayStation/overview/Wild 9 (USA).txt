Wild 9 is a 2D platformer with 3D graphics, featuring gameplay similar in vein to the company's 2D Earthworm Jim games. Unique to Wild 9 is the 'rig', a weapon your character wields to carry enemies to torture and maim them to solve puzzles and progress through the game's ten levels. Basically, it's an interesting twist and homage to more old-school Super NES video gaming.
