Big League Slugger Baseball is a cartoonish, big-head-anime-style baseball game. It uses the standard behind-the-catcher viewpoint for batting and pitching and switches to different views when the ball is hit.

One or two players can play a single exhibition game, or a single player can play a 10 or 30-game season, which can be saved to a memory card.  After completing the season you can proceed to the Final Series.

The game is unlicensed and does not include any real teams, players, or stadiums, though you can create your own players and teams.
