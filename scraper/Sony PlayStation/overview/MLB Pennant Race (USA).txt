MLB Pennant Race is one of the many baseball games released on the platform. It features the MLB license with all 28 teams at the time as well as 700 different players. It has a simulation mode where the real rules apply and an arcade mode for players who are less into serious baseball. It also contains quick play, season and home run derby as well as the option to play playoff games or to go straight to the World Series.

As a fully licensed game, it contains the real uniforms, logo and players and statistics based on the actual characteristics. Despite being released late in 1996 however, when the baseball season was already over, all the information still refers to the 1995 season. Commentary is done by Jerry Coleman.

Players can create their own players or compose a dream team from the pool of available players.
