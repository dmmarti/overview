In Rascal, you must rescue your kidnapped father, a professor,  from the clutches of the evil Chronon. Chronon is using Rascal's father to perfect time travel for his evil plans and it's up to you to stop him. You are armed with a bubble-blowing gun to take on Chronon minions as you travel through time. There are six worlds to explore which include a Medieval castle, the Wild West, Atlantis, a Pirate Ship, Prehistoric times and the Time Dimension. Each world has three time zones covering the past, the present and the future.
In each of those levels you assemble an hourglass of six pieces, which teleports you back home.
