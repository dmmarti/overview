Tecmo Stackers is a puzzle game in the vein of Tetris with the objective of the game is to match up four blocks of the same color to eliminate those colors.  When the player eliminates those colors in a chain reaction, those same blocks will be dropped on either the computer opponent or a friend.  There are also bombs that can be used to clear out large sections at one time.

There are four game modes to choose from: Arcade Competition, Time Trials and Chain Reaction, each with their own set objectives and difficulty with more than 20 levels with photo backdrops.
