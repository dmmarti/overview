It's never been easier to play a round - Virtual Golf's real-time 3D course, fly-by previews and spoken commentary offer a bird's eye view and professional advice for each hole. Virtual Golf allows a selection of up to four male and female human and computer generated characters to play a variety of game types. However, if you want to gain that all-important Professional ranking and play the Pro courses, you'll have to finish a series of tournaments under par. With zooming and panning options that allow you to view the hole from practically any angle and six different TV-style cameras, it's virtually better than the real thing!
