Based on the arcade game, Fisherman's Bait: A Bass Challenge lets you fish in four different lakes, each with 15 spots to fish from and with seven different lures to choose from. You can also play against a friend in versus mode and also featured the dual shock, new at the time to the PlayStation, which let you actually feel like you were pulling in an actually fish.
