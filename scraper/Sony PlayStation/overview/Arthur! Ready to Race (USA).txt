Arthur! Ready to Race is a racing game based on the Arthur Read aardvark character created by the American children's books writer Marc Tolon Brown. Arthur and his friends need to make the best race cart they can to participate in a big race. The gameplay is very easy and aimed at young children. They can race alone (against the computer) or with friends, and they can be able to solve problems that show up in the game. To create the cart Arthur needs to solve puzzles at the Sugar Bowl and the Pet Shop, and collect Bionic Bunny cards that can be traded in for racing accessories. There are cameo appearances by Arthur's younger sisters (D.W. and Kate Read) and his mother (Mrs. Jane Read) can also be seen.
