In this surfing game the player can choose from 10 of the best beaches the world has ever seen, and attack them with the help of 8 championship surfers, including Cory Lopez and Shane Beschen. There are plenty of moves to perform with each surfer, but the best points come in the bigger waves (including the half pipe).
