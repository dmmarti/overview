Easter Bunny's Big Day asks children to help the Easter Bunny find and deliver eggs to all the boys and girls of Easter Village. Unfortunately, the floppy-eared rabbit doesn't have enough eggs, so players will have to solve puzzles and play games to find more eggs. Multiple difficulty levels keep the action interesting for children aged four to ten, and several game modes offer additional play options. Parents can play along with children and add assistance with the "helper" feature.
