Championship Manager Quiz is the unexpected result of developer Sports Interactive looking to branch out from their successful football management series called, funnily enough, Championship Manager. If you think a quiz game may not be the best use of their skills then think again. This isn't just a collection of thousands of football trivia questions with points scored for each correct answer - that would be too simple. The football fans at Sports Interactive have managed to create a quiz game that not only mixes football knowledge but also the rules and tactics involved in the sport too. The quiz is played out like a real game of football. You see the pitch and two sets of teams and get to pick who you want to play as at the start. The idea is to pick your favourite team as the questions will really probe your love for the club. From the kick-off, you must pass the ball around the field by answering questions correctly. Below the shirt of each player are question categories. Pass the ball to that player and answer the question correctly to keep possession. Of course, answer a question incorrectly and the ball goes to the opposition. Get the ball to a striker, answer the question correctly and you've scored. Whoever gets the most questions correct is irrelevant; the game is decided on who scores the most goals. There are over 11,000 questions so you shouldn't see many being repeated often - in comparison, last year's Who Wants To Be A Millionaire? game only contained 1,000! The questions cover a broad range of football knowledge too, from domestic to international, third division to golden boot winners. There are five different modes of play, including penalty shoot out, pub quiz where more than two can play and keepy-uppy where you've got to answer correctly for as long as possible.
