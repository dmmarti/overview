VR Baseball '99 is the sequel to VR Baseball '97. In this simulation you can play any of the 30 Major League Baseball teams in their authentic stadiums. Over 750 real players are included in the game.
Gameplay modes include: exhibition, season and home run derby. All available in three difficulty levels.

The developer has aimed to make the pitching and batting more action based, and thus they do not include menu options, but are performed solely with button combos.
