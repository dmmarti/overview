EA's highly customizable golf series moves to the Sony Playstation with PGA Tour 98.  Players can choose course conditions, whether to use special rules like mulligans, and even how much your caddy will assist with setting up a shot.  With commentary by Ernie Johnson Jr., up to four players can play various play modes such as Skins games, Four-ball match play, and Skills Challenge on five real locales.  The power and accuracy of ones shot is determined with a timed meter, which can be represented with a traditional vertical bar or a more realistic arcing meter.
