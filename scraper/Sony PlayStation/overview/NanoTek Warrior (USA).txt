In the 23rd century, nanotechnology does man’s bidding. Anything from curing disease to feeding the worlds population has been taken care of by these tiny wondrous nanobots. But what happens when they become self-aware and decided to destroy their oppressors? To save the human race from extinction by its own creation, you are put in control of a new breed of nano war machine designed to fight – and win – this war. Enter NanoTek Warrior.

A ground-based shoot-em-up by design, the game employs the use of jumping, banking, and strafing as you move forward through 3D tube-like levels. The game is seem from a third-person perspective behind the ship. Some areas place you outside and some inside, but the majority of the game takes place rotating around tubes. This gameplay only differs slightly in boss levels, that allow you to rotate around a central point with no forward motion.

You can obtain different power-ups including special weapons, health bonuses and extra lives as you play through the game’s 9 levels. Each level is divided into 2 stages, one on tubes and a boss fight afterwards.
