In this fighting style game, the player assumes the personas of various character types from the Ravenloft setting of the Advanced Dungeons & Dragons universe. The goal (besides winning each battle) involves a quest for artifacts that will determine whether the "ranks of Chaos" or the "Lords of Law" are triumphant.  Unique to this fighting game (at least at the time) was the introduction of cooperative campaign play for two players at once.
