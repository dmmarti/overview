Silent Bomber is an old school style game which takes place in the future.  You play as a character named Jutah Fate, a genetically engineered man created by the government.  You're an expert at using bombs.  You start out being able to set only a few bombs at a time, but eventually you can increase the number by collecting E-Chips.   It's a fast paced game of blowing things up before they blow you up.
