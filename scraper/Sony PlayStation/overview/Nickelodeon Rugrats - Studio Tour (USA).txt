Rugrats: Studio Tour is an action game based on the Daytime Emmy-award winning animated television series Rugrats.

The Rugrats have lost Dil Pickles. As Tommy, Chuckie, Phil, Lil and Angelica you have to search for him on Hollywood movie sets. There are four sets to explore with each multiple levels for the different characters, for a total of 16 levels.

Each level is different, with various mini-games, such as racing and mini-golf. They can be played in any order and will grant you keys. When you've completed all regular levels (and thus acquired all keys) you enter the Find Dil stages. In each level you have to collect items such as cookies, coins, chocolate milk, keys, aliens, diapers, Reptar bars, rockets, gold nuggets and/or beach-balls.

The game is presented in 3D and supports multiplayer with up to 4 players.
