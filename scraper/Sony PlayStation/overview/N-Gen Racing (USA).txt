N.GEN Racing is a racing game for the Playstation. Instead of a car, like in most racing games, you control a Fighter Jet Plane.

The game features two game modes: arcade and N.GEN. In the arcade mode you play a serious of championships. Winning a championship grants you access to a higher one. In N.GEN mode you start with a poor plane and have to earn money to upgrade it so you can participate in more challenging and more rewarding races. You can choose between arcade or professional controls.

The planes can shoot various weapons, such as missiles, rockets and guns at the opponents. There are 38 jets to fly in on 14 different tracks.

In Two player mode you can play Powerball. Here each player has to try and pick up the ball and score points by flying through drones.
