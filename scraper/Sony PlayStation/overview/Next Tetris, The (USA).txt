It's Tetris, only... new.  The Tetris series returns to its roots, eschewing the Disney characters, 3D pieces, hats, and letters that have been tacked on previous entries.

Contains the standard Tetris game, as well as some variants.  Some of the new features are puzzle pieces made of individual parts- after a piece lands, some parts may be able to break off and continue down; &quot;wiggly&quot; pieces that not only provide trippy eye-candy, but may allow you to squeeze a big piece through a tight spot; challenge modes where you must clear a cluttered playfield with limited time/pieces.

Allows for solo or competitive simultaneous play.  Also links to a global board via the Internet to compare scores and times.
