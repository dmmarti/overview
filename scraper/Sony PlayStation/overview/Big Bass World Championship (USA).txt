Big Bass World Championship is the standard fishing game with two different modes of play.  There is a Practice mode where players can learn the basics of the game including casting, reeling and selection of rods and lures.  In the Tournament mode, the player can choose from either a male or female angler and choose from one of four lakes with over 15 different fishing lures.  It also features the personal endorsement of angler legend, Hank Parker.
