Blast Lacrosse is an indoor lacrosse game. It is officially licensed by and based on the National Lacrosse League and includes all nine teams of their 14th season, including mascots. It is also licensed by the Professional Lacrosse Players' Association. The game features in-game advertisements for Shamrock Lacrosse. The cover features an Ottawa Rebel player wearing #88.

The style of play is very similar to the arcade style of NBA JAM and NFL Blitz where, if a player scores a hat trick they become "on fire" and play better until stopped. The game is voiced by play-by-play man, and sports radio host, Scott Ferrall. Some of the game modes are Last Man Standing, Sudden Death and Survivor.
