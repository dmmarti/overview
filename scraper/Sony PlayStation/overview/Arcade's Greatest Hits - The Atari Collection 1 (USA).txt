Another in the series of Midway's retro arcade compilations, this is the first to feature early Atari titles (in addition to the usual FMV interview segments.)

The games included are:

1. Asteroids (vector space shooter)
2. Battlezone (vector 3D tank shooter)
3. Centipede (insect shooter)
4. Missile Command (missile shooter)
5. Super Breakout (the more varied sequel to Breakout, and the only non-shooter in this collection)
6. Tempest (color vector shooter)
