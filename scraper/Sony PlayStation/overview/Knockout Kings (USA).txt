Thirty eight of the sport's greatest boxers (including Muhammad Ali, Evander Holyfield, Sugar Ray Leonard, Oscar De La Hoya & Lennox Lewis) are together for the first time in one game for you to compete as and against.

Compete for a collection of different belts (lightweight, heavyweight, etc.) through-out the world as the greatest names in the history of boxing, or create your own boxer and go all the way to the top.

Jimmy Lenno, Jr. adds his voice for ring announcements, Sean Ogrady and Al Albert commentate the play, and Mills Lane is your fighting instructor.
