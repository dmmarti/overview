This game is a "next-gen" update of the classic "Pitfall" that was released for the Atari 2600.  Once again, take on the role of Pitfall Harry and swing across pits and battle scorpions, but this time in 3D.  As you try to complete each level and solve the puzzles that will allow you to progress through the jungle ruins, your main objective is to gather crystals.  So pick up your pick axe and start swinging! Adventure awaits!
