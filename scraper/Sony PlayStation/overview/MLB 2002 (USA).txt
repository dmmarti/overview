MLB 2002 was the fifth entry in Sony's MLB franchise with the standard set-up as the previous versions.  A 3-D polygon based look with real-life animations (300 total) and 250 authentic signature moves of top MLB players of the time and authentic MLB teams, logos and stadiums.  To provide authenticity, MLB players and officials lent their expertise to the game in order to create a more realistic and life-like appearance and feel to it.

The standard game modes apply: Exhibition, Season, Tournament, Home Run Derby, etc., along with a two-player mode where friends can compete head-to-head.  There is also a franchise mode where players can not only trade, but also manage finances and other front office decisions to run a baseball franchise.  Vin Scully and Dave Campbell also lend their voices for in-game commentary.
