Roswell Conspiracies: Aliens, Myths & Legends is a game based on the animated TV series of the same name, basically X-Files for kids. The player takes the role of Nick Logan who has the unique ability to see through alien disguises and accompanies him during his work: catching aliens to save the world. The gameplay principle is simple: the player walks through 15 levels with a fixed camera perspective and shoots everything he sees, e.g. werewolves or vampires. To do this he uses one of the many weapons he finds - all of them have unlimited ammo but have to regenerate energy during pauses of fire. But the player doesn't kill his enemies for good: He has to catch them with his alien trap (which is a matter of pressing one button) or they regenerate.

Besides the shooting the game also features its share of puzzles, e.g. activating a mechanism, and bosses. There is also a mini game which comes into place whenever Logan has to disable a bomb or open a lock: basically a series of quick time events where the player has to press the correct button with the right timing. The levels are divided into five areas: London, Ireland, San Francisco, a Maya temple and Roswell.
