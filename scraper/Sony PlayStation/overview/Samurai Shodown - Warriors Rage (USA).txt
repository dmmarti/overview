Warriors Rage is the seventh Samurai Shodown game. The events of the game take place twenty years after those described in the Hyper Neo Geo 64 arcade predecessors.  The game includes new swordsmen like Rinka Yoshino (a daughter of samurai family), Seishiro Kuki (the new protagonist), Ran Po, Garyo the Whirlwind, Jin-Emon Hanafusa and more. Gameplay features a new life gauge system, split in three sections; when the two sections are drained from the opponent, the character performs taunting moves.
