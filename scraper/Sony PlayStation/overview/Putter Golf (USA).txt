Putter Golf is a 3D miniature golf simulation. It features both a "normal" 9-hole course, with realistic courses, as well as a "trick" 9-hole course, with somewhat more unusual features, such as warp zones and conveyor belts. Rounding out the package is a mix mode, with randomly selected holes from both courses, and a practice mode that both allows you to practice hitting on various slopes, and try out the features from the trick mode.

You can compete both against the CPU, on multiple difficulty levels, and against up to three other players.
