In Battle Hunter, you play as a warrior that battles monsters and collects treasures from dungeons. To do this you must go into a dungeon and find the target item that you must acquire. However, monsters are also lurking around plus the boss who will pop out if the game goes to long! You can also fight other warriors to get their items (this is useful if someone else has the target item!) The game can go up to 4 players.
