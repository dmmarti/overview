A baseball sim updated for the 1999 season featuring Hall of Fame broadcaster Vin Scully calling each game. The game features various modes including exhibition, season, play-offs, and home-run derby.  Each MLB stadium is recreated faithfully, as are the players. A new feature for this year's edition of the game is Spring Training mode, which allows one to create a new player and put him in the Minors and see if he can make it to the Majors.
