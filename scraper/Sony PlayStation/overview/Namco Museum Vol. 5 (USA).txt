This Namco Museum series member combines Pac-Mania, Dragon Spirit (which is a combination of 1942 and Xevious), Metro-Cross (a type of skateboarding action game), Baraduke (where you control the hero through many caverns filled with monsters) and Legend of Valkyrie, which combined classic gameplay with improved scaling effects.

And as usual, you can find some great info on each title in the museum.
