Robin Hood (christened Robert) is a heroic outlaw in English folklore who was born in approximately 1290. A highly skilled archer and swordsman, he is known for "robbing from the rich and giving to the poor," assisted by a group of fellow outlaws known as his "Merry Men." Traditionally Robin Hood and his men are depicted wearing Lincoln green clothes. The origin of the legend is claimed by some to have stemmed from actual outlaws, or from ballads or tales of outlaws. Robin Hood became a popular folk figure starting in medieval times continuing through modern literature, films, and television. In the earliest sources Robin Hood is a commoner, but he was often later portrayed as an aristocrat wrongfully dispossessed of his lands and made into an outlaw by an unscrupulous sheriff. The books often had political-cultural undertones, championing Anglo-Saxons as heroes and the Normans (whose conquest of England began in 1066) as unjust tyrants. Light gun shooter, also called light gun game or simply gun game, is a video game genre in which the primary design element is aiming and shooting with a gun-shaped controller. Light gun shooters revolve around the protagonist shooting targets, either antagonists or inanimate objects. Robin Hood the Siege is a gun game in the style of games like Operation Wolf series based on the famous character, the game was published only in Europe in the year 2004 by Phoenix Games.
