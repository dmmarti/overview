E.T., finally having left Earth, has been tasked with retrieving rare species of plants across five planets. E.T. has several abilities to help him out, including healing, which can restore life to plants, telekinesis, which can move inaccessible objects, and heart stun, which can knock out enemies.

In each level, you will explore and collect all the plants, while avoiding or knocking out enemies. Some areas may be locked behind barriers which require switches to be pressed, or objects to be moved. Once all plants are collected, head to the exit.
