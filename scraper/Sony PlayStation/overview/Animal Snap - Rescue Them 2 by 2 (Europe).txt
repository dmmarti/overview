In this children's title based on the Chinese tile game of mahjongg, players must clear stacks of tiles by matching pairs of letters, animals, food, or plants. Each game is timed, and the goal is to clear each of the ten levels within the limit. A record time is also presented in the bottom right corner of the screen. On the right side of the playfield is the word "bonus," which lights up whenever players match the five corresponding letters. Once the word is spelled out, players unlock an additional game called Block Blaster, which is patterned after the classic Breakout. Players are challenged to eliminate a series of blocks by ricocheting a bouncing ball into a wall using a horizontal paddle.
