With 8 courses and a full course architect, you will have plenty of golfing to do. Improved ball physics, improved graphics, even a full simulation mode where aiming and swinging is done for you. If you prefer to do your own "swing", two different swing types are there for you to choose from. All the standard variants like regular, skins, and more. Multiplayer includes LAN play, single-computer turn-based games and the online tournaments (which are no longer active).
