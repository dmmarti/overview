The man with the big bombs is blowing up a completely different type of game in this strange and whimsical racing game. It sure isn't like your typical racer -- Bomberman Fantasy Race has players riding on big loping kangaroos and giant blue rabbitty-dinos as they hop and dash to the finish line with long, bounding gaits. It's a wild race, made even wilder with all the bombs and action of Bomberman. Two can challenge each other to a blast around the track, or run for it on your own in the single-player mode. Buy new bombs and better ride-a-long animals to give the competition something to blow its top over!
