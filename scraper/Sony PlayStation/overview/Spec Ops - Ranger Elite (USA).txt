This is one of those first generation soldier shooters, that was one of the first games to emphazise tactics before total mayhem.

This game let you lead a kind of special forces which you chose out of a bigger group, like in Hidden and Dangerous. The difference in this game is that it's somewhat more action, and that it's played in third-person view.

The game takes you to several places of the earth, where you have to complete the mission objectives rather than just killing everyone (though completing missions often is about killing) to win the game.
