Ubi Soft's Surf Riders will have you shredding the waves using one of the top surfboarders from around the world. In this virtual recreation of the actual sport, you're awarded points based on the quality of your run as you attempt to dominate the world circuit. Points are awarded in various areas including how long you ride the wave, the height and number of turns made in an aerial, how high the spray kicks up and how long you remain in the pipeline. Prior to each round, you will select one of many different surfboards. Because surfboards harness various strengths and weaknesses, you should pick boards based on the current oceanic location and objective. Surf Riders features two modes including the Free Play and World Challenge Cup. In the Free Play mode, you can practice skills without a time limit; this will give novice players ample time to learn control layouts and combinations. The World Challenge Cup mode is for all the marbles -- the championship. A round in this mode consists of three heats: the qualifying, semifinal and final. Each heat has four computer-controlled competitors. You must place either first or second in order to advance to the next heat. In addition to supporting the Dual Shock Analog Controller for analog controls and vibration, Surf Riders uses a memory card to save game progress. Additionally, it features a soundtrack composed of surf-rock bands including Los Straitjackets, The Aquamen and Pollo Del Mar.
