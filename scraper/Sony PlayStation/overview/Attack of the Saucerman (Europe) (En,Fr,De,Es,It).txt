The "NEDCO" have plans to make earthlings their staple food group. It is up to you to make sure that doesn’t happen.

In this comedic science fiction 3D action game you play Ed, a blue-collar worker from the alien world of Grimloid.  In his flying saucer, fly through 28 arcade-like levels and devastate your enemies with a variety of weapons, including one called the "Love Bomb".

Besides the basic forward, back, left and right movements, strafe, jump and shoot the "Neds" for points.
