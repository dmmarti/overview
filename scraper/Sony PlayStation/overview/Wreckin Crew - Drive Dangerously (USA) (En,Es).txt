Mario Kart clone for the PlayStation and PC. Players take control of characters such as a pair of siamese twins, a circus trainer and a mad scientist and race their hot-rods across 10 tracks using crazy weapons such as lighting bolts, body bags and chickens.

A 2 player mode is available, and there are many funny unlockable characters. The tracks are sprawling, with teleports, secret routes and  hidden areas to find.
