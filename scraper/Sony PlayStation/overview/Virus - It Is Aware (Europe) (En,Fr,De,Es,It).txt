Virus: It Is Aware is a loose spin-off of the 1999 horror film Virus, and also the Dark Horse comic which the film is based on. Despite the fact that the game's opening and closing cinematics are set on a boat and space station like the film and comic series, the game itself is totally disconnected from both the source material and the game's own prologue and epilogue, instead being set in a high-tech hotel. In this survival horror game, the player controls the female police officer Joan, who, along with her partner Sutter, investigates numerous murders of the hotel's inhabitants, only to discover that an alien electronic virus uses mechanical items to create robots, who in turn are built into the human corpses, creating zombie-type cyborgs. The game features light puzzle elements along with weapon-based combat, utilizing weapons such as pistols, Uzis and tazers; while the ballistic weapons are replenished by ammunition pickups, the tazer utilizes a depletion-recharge system.
