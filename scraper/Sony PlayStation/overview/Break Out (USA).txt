In this updated version of Breakout, players take the role of "Bouncer", whose main objective is to rescue both his friends and Daisy and defeat the evil Batnix. 

Gameplay is similar to the original game from 1977, but with 3D graphics and multiplayer support. Play through exotic locations like a dark prison cell, a menacing dragon-owned castle, an animal infested farm, and outer space. The game also contains numerous challenging modes, secrets and bonuses.
