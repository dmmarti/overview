This is the European edit of Konami's successful series Beatmania, a part of their BeMani franchise (DDR, DrumMania, Guitar Freaks and more). You get to play well known club tracks on a special controller that looks similar to the original arcade one, with 5 piano keys and a "turntable". Pieces of the song fall down the screen and you have to hit the right key or spin the turntable to nail the melody or drum piece falling. The better you get the higher your rating is, and you unlock more songs as you go.

In this version some of the songs featured are: "Sing It Back" by Moloko, "Jacques Your Body" by Les Rythmes Digitales, "Dreaming" by Ruffdriverz and many more.
