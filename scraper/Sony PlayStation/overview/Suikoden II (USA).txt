A young boy from the town Kyaro, adopted and raised by a martial artist together with his sister Nanami, now serves in a Highland army, in a youth squad, together with his best friend Jowy. Their camp is attacked during the night. The two friends escape and jump down from a high cliff into a river. What will destiny bring to them? What will they achieve in their lives? Will they fight together or will their pathes be separated from now on? 

This tale of friendship, faith, war, and betrayal is a sequel to Konami's  Suikoden. You will have to build an army and to participate in a terrible war, defending the lives of the innocents. You'll be able to recruit 108 characters (Stars of Destiny), and to build your own castle. Together with traditional turn-based party combat, there are also strategic battles, which are quite different from those of "Suikoden": you have to move your squads on a grid field, trying to surround the enemy and not to get surrounded yourself.
