With disregard for a background story, Funcom Dublin offers a Wipeout-esque mix of racing and driving at a very fast pace. Completing laps within the allotted time does not suffice, you also need to destroy a certain amount of vehicles. Contrary to the aforementioned title, you drive ordinary racing cars, if you count out the mounted weapons. These include mines, concussion missiles, smart bombs, heat-seeking missiles, lasers and firewalls. Some are provided by taking out enemies, but power-ups, time bonuses, energy, armor and a handicap that turns the screen upside-down, can also be collected.

Five cars are available, with different statistics and built-in weapons. The initially weak weapon is soon replaced when you collect upgrade icons. To activate these, you have to complete a bonus stage after which you can also save your game. To add to the game's length, each of the twelve tracks, based on the settings "city", "mountain" or "space", has three variations: reverse, at night or the combination of the two. Other features include a small diagram showing approaching cars to time your mines, and pumping electronic tracks to match the game's pace.
