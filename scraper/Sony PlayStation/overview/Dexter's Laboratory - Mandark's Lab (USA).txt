Based on the boy genius rivalry between Dexter and the scheming Mandark from the Cartton Network show, the title is actually a collection of mini-games designed specifically for the PlayStation.

Game challenges are fashioned around a platform 'hub' and include variations on Dancing games ('Dee Dee’s Dance Class'), shooting gallery (Dexter’s Dodge Ball), racing game, ice hockey variant etc.
