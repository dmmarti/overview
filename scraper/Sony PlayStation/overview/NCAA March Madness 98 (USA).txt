EA Sports finally hits the college basketball scene with NCAA March Madness '98 for the PlayStation. Along with a full NCAA license is 107 Division I teams, team-specific fight songs and chants as well as authentic college uniforms and logos. Nine women's teams have also been included, which is a first for a college sports game (or any sports game for that matter). Also unique to this game is the Momentum Meter, which will rise as your team starts to get hot. Once it's maxed, look out -- the crowd will become frenzied and your shooting percentage increases. You'll also have the ability to create your very own players, modify rosters, call plays on the fly and use the give-and-go to outmaneuver your opponent. You can also make substitutions for tired or fouled-out players and check their statistics during the game. While taking your team through an entire 1997-98 season with a schedule of thirty games, make sure you call the right offensive and defensive formations if you want a shot at winning them. The Exhibition mode is the way to go for single match-ups and practicing control setups. If you're feeling game, take on the Tourney mode -- a 64 team NCAA Championship Tournament!
