Join the Crazy Aces stunt flying team at the Sky Ranch and choose from among eight aeroplanes in the hanger, each with their own personality and performance to race through five distinct courses in this air racing game.  The eight aircraft vary in acceleration, maneuverability, aerodynamics and straight-line top speed. Each can be upgraded (and downgraded) with bonuses and power-downs scattered throughout each of the courses. Variable attributes include performance, shields and weapons.
