Rampage was a simple arcade game. There were three monsters and one goal: Smash stuff. Rampage Through Time, the fourth installment, is played in a similar fashion to the previous games with a few new features. 

As the title implies, Rampage Through Time adds a time-travel element. Your oversized mutants travel to time periods such as the Old West and Medieval times, as well as other, more general  historical periods, like "war zone," "alien," and "gangster."
