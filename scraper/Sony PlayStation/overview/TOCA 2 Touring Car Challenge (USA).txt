The BTCC (British Touring Car Championship) was Britain's biggest domestic racing championship in the late 1990s, and this game recreates it. Cars from 8 constructors tough it out over 8 circuits of first-person high-contact racing. 

You can race the full championship or take on single races or time trial challenges. At this time the series required all cars to make at least one pit stop during the race. This seriously affects your driving and pitting strategy.

Besides the TOCA races, each of the venues also features special racing events where all drivers race identical cars. These range from the Ford Fiesta to exotics like the AC Blower and the Lister Storm, and higher, in a format similar to American IROC races. 8 bonus track layouts are also included.
