A cart racing game featuring Disney Characters  Starring Jiminy Cricket, Chip, and Dale, and a few characters created specifically for the game.  The catch is that all of the tracks are actually based on rides at all of the four Walt Disney World Parks (Haunted Mansion, Splash Mountain, Space Mountain, Rock'n'Rollercoaster, Typhoon Lagoon, etc...).
