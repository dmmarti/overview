Winky the Little Bear is a single player game aimed at younger children. There is a big storm in the forest. Teddy and Mi are swept up into the air and land in a very high tree and get stuck in it's branches. Their friends come to rescue them but can they succeed?  The game consists of an animated story with no player interaction, six paintings that can be coloured in and six scenes that can be turned into sliding block puzzles
