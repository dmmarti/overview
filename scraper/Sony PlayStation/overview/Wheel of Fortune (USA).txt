The long running game show hits the PC. All the areas of the show are here to play, including all of the prizes, 2000 puzzles and plenty of FMV of lovely hostess Vanna White. 

There is a new version of the game also available, where you are given a certain amount of free spin disks. If you choose the wrong letter, or land on 'lose a turn' or 'bankrupt', you lose one of the disks. Once you run out, the game is over.
