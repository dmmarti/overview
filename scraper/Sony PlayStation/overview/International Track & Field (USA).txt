International Track & Field continues with the button mashing of the NES games in 11 different sports, now in full 3D! The sports range from 100 meter sprint and 110 meter hurdles to javelin and discus.

The game features two game modes. One where you can practice each sport individually and the "normal" mode, where you can go at it with up to 4 people facing off in all the sports one after another.
