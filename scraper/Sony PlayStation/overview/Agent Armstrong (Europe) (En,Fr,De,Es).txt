Agent Armstrong is a 3D side-scrolling single-player-shooter released in the early days of the PSX. Set in 1930, Armstrong must battle across 4 continents and deep underwater as the Syndicate attempt to control the world. The 30 levels are mission-based with at least 2 objectives. There are boss sequences every 5 levels or so. Whilst the game is predominantly side-scrolling there are many sequences and areas (boss areas in particular) where the action is free form.
