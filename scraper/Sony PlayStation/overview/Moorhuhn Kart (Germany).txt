Moorhuhn Kart is a kart racing game. The game features five generic locations (countryside level, a slippery ice level, a mountain level with dangerous sections,a desert level and the last lap of the Grand Prix takes places in a fiery lava level), five characters and a set of weapons.

While racing, there are power-ups to collect, such as turbo to increase the speed, chewing gum to make the other karts get stuck, and an egg to throw to slow another car down. Players can choose from 5 characters: Moorhuhn, Lesshuhn, Moorfrosh, Pumpkin and Schneemann.
