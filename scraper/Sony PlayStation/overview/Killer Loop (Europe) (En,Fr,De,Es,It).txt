If you need an adrenaline rush, Killer Loop might be just your thing: Step into your magnetic glider and race through lots of roller-coaster like tracks full of curves and loops, psyched up by pumping techno beats.  There are of course power-ups scattered on the track that may be picked up, including weapon systems to get rid of your enemies.  Similar to Wipeout, this is a game for speed freaks.
