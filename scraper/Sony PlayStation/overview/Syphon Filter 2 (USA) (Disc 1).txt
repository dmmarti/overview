The sequel to the previous year's Syphon Filter, Syphon Filter 2 adds new features such as a two player mode, new locations, new weapons, and more.

The game compares to Goldeneye on the N64.
It's a shooter, but you must also use strategy.  You have a health meter, so it's not a "one shot and you're dead" type of game. You must complete missions, or battle it out in a deathmatch with your friends, or enemies.

The plot is about you having to prevent the sale of the Syphon Filter virus to a terrorist nation.
