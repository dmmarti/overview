Essential a basic shoot-em-up game, Eliminator puts you in control of experimental hovering craft, running the gauntlet of various courses, dodging obstacles and blowing up opponents in an attempt to reach the end before an on-board bomb blows you up and out the game.

Interesting premise.

As you progress through the game you gain the standard options of upgrades and the courses become trickier to navigate.

Can be quite fun.
