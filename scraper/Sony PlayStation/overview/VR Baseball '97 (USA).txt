VR Baseball '97 is a baseball game. It prides itself on being the first fully 3D baseball game. You also have complete control over your camera to view the action from any angle. 

The game comes with a Major League Baseball license and thus features over 700 Major League Baseball players, 28 official stadiums, and all the statistics from the 1997 season. 

Game modes include Exhibition Game and Home Run Derby. Both can be played in multi-player mode.
