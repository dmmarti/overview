PO'ed is an action game similar to Doom.
You are a cook who has to escape an alien world. With such weapons as frying pan and a drill, you must bash your way through levels full of monsters, one of them being a walking arse (yes, not kidding).
One of the most useful items in game is a jetpack which you must use frequently to explore levels and get to places where no spacecook has gone before.
