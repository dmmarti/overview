Titan Wars is a 3D shooter that takes place on and near the many moons of Saturn. You are a hot-shot pilot with a troubled past. You've been re-assigned to a new squadron aboard a Tomlinson-class carrier. There's trouble on a mining colony on the moon Janus. Your squadron is sent in to investigate, and uncover a lot more than they went looking for.  Solar Eclipse plays kind of like a sequel to Total Eclipse for the 3DO. Gameplay is pure arcade-style shooter. You can view the game from a behind-the-ship perspective, or an in-cockpit perspective, but the scrolling is on rails. You can only travel in one direction. In each of the 9 missions you will find wave after wave of enemy ships, and a powerful boss ship at the end.  The story in this game is told through a series of full-motion video clips. In addition to between-level scenes, FMV messages from your squad mates appear from time to time while you play the game.
