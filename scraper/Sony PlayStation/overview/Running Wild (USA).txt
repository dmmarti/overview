This original take on racing sets you up as a bipedal animal, jumping over all sorts of obstacles in an attempt to speed past your wild competition. 

Each of the game's six tracks is set in a vastly different locale, presenting unique challenges for every animal on the roster. 

Choose from six beastly characters, each with a different skill set: The elephant is the strongest, the bull is the most agile, and the zebra is the fastest. Hidden boss characters can be unlocked in the game's Challenge mode, while Time Trial allows you to race against your own best time.

There's a wide variety of speed-ups and power-ups out there, and you'll need them to get faster, bigger, or more powerful. Who needs combat cars when you can race jungle animals?
