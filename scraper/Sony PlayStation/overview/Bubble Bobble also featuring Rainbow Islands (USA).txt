Bubble Bobble: One or two players attempt to save their friends in this re-release of the 1987 classic puzzle/action game. Players blow bubbles to trap enemies. When they pop the bubbles, fruit comes out and the players compete for the points. If they don't pop the bubbles in time, the enemies escape and become faster.

Rainbow Islands: one player only. Rainbow Islands is the sequel to Bubble Bobble. Instead of bubbles, you create rainbows. The highly versatile rainbow can be used as bridges, as platforms, or as a weapon. You can shoot a rainbow at an enemy, you can trap it inside, or you can drop a rainbow on an enemy from above.
