A racing game set in the golden era of BMWs and Mercedes, Alfa Romeos and Bugattis, Enzo Ferrari and Sterling Moss, but with all the 3D rendering effects you would expect from a standard Playstation racer.

Putting you in the seat of some of the most well-known racing cars of the time, Mille Miglia lets you try out well well-honed Playstation 'driving' skills on some new, but old, tracks. Letting you take part in full championship mode, the game sets you about some idyllic countryside scenery in the hopes of obtaining that elusive victory.
