The Race mode lets the player race on 27 different courses. This mode lets the player race solo or against one or two other opponents. In the solo race, the player has to keep hitting checkpoints in a limited amount of time.

Trick mode has the player try to do as many tricks as possible within a given time limit. Performing tricks gains the player more time to complete a course
