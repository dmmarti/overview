FA Manager is the first game in a series of football (soccer) management games where the player takes on the role of the manager of a football team. This title is focused on the English leagues and contains the premier league as well as league division 1, 2 and 3. It is fully licensed for the teams and players for the 1998-1999 season.  As a manager the player has to handle the management of finances, transfers, loans and incentives. Matches do not only cover the leagues, but also take into account European cups. Matches for the own team are shown through a sped up 3D view for the highlights and audio commentary. During a match it is possible to manage substitutions, change tactics, and watch the positions of the players and the scorers.  The game can be played by two players taking turns and progress can be saved on a memory card.
