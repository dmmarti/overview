The original Capcom VS SNK gets an home exclusive upgrade with CVS Pro. New additions include Joe Higashi of SNK fame and Capcom's own taunt-master Dan Hibiki, added moves for existing characters, and new modes of play.

A special version was created for the PSOne, with redone graphics and slightly refined speed and play.
