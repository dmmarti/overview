Triple Play Baseball is part of the EA Sports line of MLB Baseball sims.  This edition was released in 2001 and would have been called Triple Play 2002 if they had not dropped the year off the title. 

Like previous editions you can pick from any of the teams in the National League or American League.  Mostly little has changed with this edition except for a world tournament that has been added.  You have to win the World Series however to see this option.
