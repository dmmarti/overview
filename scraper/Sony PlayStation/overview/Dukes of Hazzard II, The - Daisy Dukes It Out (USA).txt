Nearly identical gameplay to Dukes of Hazzard: Racing For Home, this game is 18 more levels of racing around the off-road areas of Hazzard county. From the title as you may imagine, the plot focuses on Daisy and a friend of hers, Missy who are knee-deep in trouble.

In addition to the single player plot missions, there is also Two-Player racing mode, a Scramble mode, a Joyride mode and a mode called Grab the Jug, where the players try to collect an evasive jug on or off the road before the other players.

Choice of vehicles  includes the General Lee itself, Daisy's Jeep, Uncle Jesse's old truck, Missy's spider ride and a farm's chicken truck.
