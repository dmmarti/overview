X2 is the sequel only released on Playstation of one of the best shooters on Commodore Amiga: Project-X.
			Project-X is a scrolling shooter game for the Amiga computer released in 1992. It was also ported to DOS. Developed and published by Team17, it was regarded as one of the best shooter games for that platform at the time, both for its technical excellence in graphics and sounds, and for its difficult and interesting gameplay[citation needed]. The game resembles Konami's side-scrolling shooter games such as Gradius, Salamander and Parodius.
			X2, sometimes known as Project X-2 is a simple but technically impressive, arcade-style side scrolling shoot 'em up released during the Team17-Ocean collaboration era of video games that created the Worms series. It is the sequel to the Amiga 16-bit shooter Project-X.
			Unlike many other games of the era, it was never released to a home computer audience and was fairly poorly received[citation needed]: this was mainly due to 2D scrolling shooters losing appeal in general public eye at the end of the Nineties, in favor of 3D games.
			The game was released in Eastern territories by Capcom, who handle such releases for many Western games including Grand Theft Auto III. Capcom and Team17 worked together to make the game more palatable for the Eastern market.
			The game's plot is about an alien invasion on earth and the player controls the only one (or 2 if he choose the 2 player game) who can stop it.
			The game features 10 levels and a final level of fast paced action and really difficult gameplay. Huge boss monsters at the end of each level. Each enemy wave is different, memorizing patterns won't help you... Team17 claims there is absolutely NO slowdown in this game, even in two player co-op mode!
