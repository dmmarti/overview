Blockids is a Breakout variant whose unique feature is multiple camera angles. Instead of only including the typical top down camera angle, the game also utilizes a isometric camera angle, a behind the paddle camera angle, and a track the ball's movement camera angle.  The game contains an Adventure mode and a Challenge mode. In the Adventure mode players choose from one of six characters and go on a mission to reclaim 5 magic crystals. The accomplish this task, players must beat a series of stages and boss monsters at every 10th stage. Beating stages requires bouncing a ball off a paddle to break blocks, which get arranged in different formations depending on the stage. The player can also make the ball jump over the bricks and try to break them from the top down. Each character in the game has their own special power meter which is filled up by hitting several blocks in succession. Some examples of character's powers include Super-Extend which elongates the paddle, Ball Catcher which makes the ball stick onto the paddle, or Power Ball which makes ball that go through blocks instead of simply bouncing off them. Some broken blocks also unleash power-ups. Power-ups include either speeding up or slowing down the ball, a 1up which gives the player and extra life, and a power-up which instantly clears the stage. This game lets the player only have 2 lives and 3 continues before the game is over. The Challenge mode is similar to the Adventure mode except the player is now given infinite amount of continues throughout its 100 stages.
