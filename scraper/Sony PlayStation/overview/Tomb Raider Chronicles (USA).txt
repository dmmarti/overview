Just when the world had come to agree that Lara is finally a thing of the past, along comes a new collection of levels for our lovely Lara Croft to tackle. Each of the four chapters center around a different area of Lara's past, from the very start of her life (as a teen raider!!) to just before her death. Chronicles also includes a level editor, allowing the player to create new Tombs for Lara to raid.
