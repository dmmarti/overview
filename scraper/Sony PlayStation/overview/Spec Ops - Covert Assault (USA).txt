Covert Assault, another installment of the Spec Ops franchise, offers up action for one or two players to control US Army Rangers, in 3rd-person missions and combat across four different locations. At the beginning of each mission, you choose a two-man team from a group of six rangers. Each has different qualities (a sniper, a gunner, a grenadier), so you need to compose a team fit for the specific task, with more than 10 weapons available.

Singleplayer mode permits the player to control the ranger and his buddy at the same time. Two-player offers cooperative split-screen play. The emphasis is on tactical play, although there's plenty of action.
