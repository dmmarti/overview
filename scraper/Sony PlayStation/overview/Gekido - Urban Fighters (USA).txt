Gekido: Urban Fighters is a 3D fighting game, inspired by the classic 2D beat-em-ups. The year is 2011 and a hackers' antivirus has evolved into an independent entity. Playing as one of the four characters: Travis the policeman, Michelle the military, Ushi the master or Tetsuo the school guy, you have to go after the hackers and find the virus.

The levels are filled with weapons and objects to vary your attacks. Regular moves includes acrobatics, jumps, kicks and punches with combos. You can also activate a short rage boost for additional damage. Next to the regular missions, there is an arena mode and co-operative multitap play with up to 4 players. 

Marvel comic book artist Joe Mad contributed, and the artists Fatboy Slim and Apartment 26 were contracted for the music.
