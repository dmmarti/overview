King's Field is a first person RPG set on a dark island where evil has been emenating from and the inhabitants disappearing.  Movement is handled similarly to Doom and the like but with most weapons being handheld and the pace not quite so frantic.  This game is not an action game though, with many RPG elements such as exploration, interation with other characters, aquisition of items and treasure as well as ataining levels and improving statistics.
