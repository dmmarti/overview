The "3" in the title not only indicates that it's the third part of the Populous series originally created by Peter Molyneux, it also stands for the 3rd dimension. Part 3 is now 3D accelerated, but this is not the only change the game underwent since part 2: you don't anymore simply lower and raise land to gain bigger houses which can defend themselves stronger. Now you have to chop trees to build your huts. Depending on how many men are in the house, the faster its population and the house itself grows. You can train your men as fighters, priests etc. New spells can be added to your spell inventory via shrines scattered all over the world. 

The funny thing is that this world is really a little planet; you can scroll around it.
