Pro Evolution Soccer  has more than 50 international soccer sides and 16 of the best club teams from around the world - ranging from Manchester United and AC Milan to Leeds United, who were briefly a top side at this time.

The player also has a large array of options. The player can play single matches as well as league or cup tournaments, and there is also a training mode. There are 5 difficulty levels, different weather conditions, and injuries are optional, as are extra time and penalty shoot-outs. Players can be designed with a range of physical and mental attributes, as well as different appearances.

Gameplay is not as end-to-end as the contemporary FIFA titles, and finishing is more of a matter of precise timing and skill. Players and officials make mistakes on occasion as well.
