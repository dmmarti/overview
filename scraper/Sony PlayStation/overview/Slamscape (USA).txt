Cyberspace is in danger again, and you've got to save it. Gameplay is reminiscent of Spectre VR; the goal is to pilot a Slamjet (a hovercraft-like vehicle) around futuristic virtual landscapes and collect a series of glowing objects called "Orb-ids" while avoiding a series of enemies and bosses which require some puzzle-solving in order to defeat.  Once you collect all the Orb-ids in a level you clean up the virtual zone, and move on to the next.  Graphics are fully 3D with polygonal enemies and objects, and the game touts a dynamic soundtrack composed by alternative rock band God Lives Underwater.
