The Quest for the Sunstones is a 3D platform jump'n'run game. Like Indiana Jones, Hugo takes on great danger only equipped with a whip. It is a Crash Bandicoot like game - both in graphics style and gameplay. Hugo has to collect three magic Sunstones and place them in the right way and with the sun shining on them he will prevent Scylla and Don Crocos evil plan on causing death to the lovely and sweet creatures called Kikurians and destruction of their village.
