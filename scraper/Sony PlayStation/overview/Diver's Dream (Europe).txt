Diver's Dream is a game inspired by Luc Besson's movie The Big Blue. The player meets an old man named Roberto Meyer, who's life long dream is to explore the wreck of the ship Gigantic Matilda. Together with him and his grand daughter Olivia, the player sets out to start exploring the vast sea bed and finally maybe even Gigantic Matilda...

The player starts out wearing just a pair of swim trunks, and in order to reach the great depths of the sea the equipment needs to be up to date. The game is mission based and the player will have collect treasures and valuables from the sea bed and with the money earned, upgrade the scuba gear and advance to more difficult missions with greater rewards.

The game is semi free roaming in nature, meaning that the player gets to explore a big area at the time. Options are to collect treasure, fight off aggressive underwater creatures or simply play around with the friendly dolphins.
