Disney's Winnie the Pooh Preschool is a point and click educational game based on characters and material created by the author/illustrator team of A.A. Milne and E.H. Shepard. It is a companion game to Disney's Winnie the Pooh Toddler and Disney's Winnie the Pooh Kindergarten.   Waking up from a nap in the Hundred Acre Wood, a puzzled Winnie the Pooh has the feeling he's forgotten something important and somehow arrives at the idea that it must be Eeyore's birthday. The player follows Pooh in his journey around the Wood to spread the news, dropping in on Kanga, Tigger, Owl, Piglet and Rabbit and helping them prepare a party through various activities and minigames.
