Blaze & Blade: Eternal Quest is an action RPG where you control a party of four. Character creation allows you to define a player's behaviour as well as their abilities. Your goal is to venture into The Forbidden Land, formerly known as Foresia, and deliver the land from evil. Foresia has been inhabited by monsters and demons since the time of the twelve Wisemen. These monsters and demons often transform into useful items once destroyed.
