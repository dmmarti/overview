Buggy is a racing game where you drive a small radio controlled car. The player can choose between 12 different cars (some have to be unlocked) to control. The game consists of 16 levels and a number of bonus levels. There are three game modes: Time attack, Challenge 1 and Challenge 2. In Time Attack you compete against yourself for new personal records. At the beginning not all levels are available in this mode, they have to be unlocked by completing certain levels in Challenge 1. Challenge 2 is not available until Challenge 1 is completed. The second challenge contains all the levels from the first challenge plus some new ones.
