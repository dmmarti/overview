Formula 1 was the first of Sony's official FIA-licensed Formula 1 games. All the cars, teams and circuits of the 1995 season are recreated in millimetric detail. Variable game modes and camera angles are included. To widen the game's appeal, it includes optional helpers such as automatic braking.

The game contains a rock soundtrack including tracks by Joe Satriani and Steve Vai, and commentary from UK TV legend Murray Walker.
