A combination of the classic Marvel comics characters and the recent movie release, X-Men. All the characters are here, each with their normal moves (much like Street Fighter in terms of the buttons pressed on the control pad), and plenty of super moves to spice things up.

There are plenty of bonus things to find on the CD, ranging from movie clips of your fighter after you complete the game with him/her, new costumes (each fighter starts with costumes from the comics. The new ones, when unlocked, are much like the ones in the movie) and a movie story if you complete the game with all of the fighters.

Also included is a movie trailer for X-Men the movie, and comic art by Marvel boys Joe Maduera, Adam and Andy Kubert and more.
