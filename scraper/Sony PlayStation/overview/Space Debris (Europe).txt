This third-person perspective space shooter casts the player as UED pilot James Bryant, the brash young adventurer who is humanity's last hope.    Gameplay takes place across 10 levels with 6 different attack ships to pilot.  The majority of the levels are linear with a few alternate paths.  There are, however, numerous free-roaming levels which give the navigation controls over to the player.  Five different power-ups enhance weapon capabilities while medals are awarded based on level performace.
