The aliens have stolen a super missile and will not hesitate to use it unless we pay their ransom demand, which is a large amount of Uranium. You soldier, must enter the enemy zone and retrieve this missile by causing disruption among their troops and then taking out the alien scum. Some alien attack force, calling themselves the 'Varinians' have decided to make life on Earth pretty miserable. You see, they need uranium and they've nabbed one of our Super-Missiles to use as a blackmail demand. Basically, we have to deliver them fifty payloads of the raidoactive stuff, or they'll nuke us with our own weapon. Nice guys, huh? The game is played through three different Worlds, each comprising of many levels. There is also an endgame when the three main worlds have been completed, which must be successfully achieved in order to finish the game. Has a different cover and is censored in Germany: Kill robots instead of people.
