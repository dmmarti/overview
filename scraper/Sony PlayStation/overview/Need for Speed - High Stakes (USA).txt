Need 4 Speed games always took a slight step into sequels, but this time it's like a totally new dimension of playing. There are about 20 or such cars to choose, and you can play split-screened on the same computer, or via modem. You can hunt or be hunted, either way it's difficult, but driving in the moonlight with fireworks in deep distance makes it worthy at least a look.
