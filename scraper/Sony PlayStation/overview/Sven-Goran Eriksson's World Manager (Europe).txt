In 2002 Anco developed two soccer games that were licensed by the Swedish England coach Sven-Göran Eriksson. One was a action football game and this is the manager game. 

Your job is to take control of the England team and lead it through the qualifying stage before reaching the World Cup (and then later Euro 2004). For each match you play you are to take out a 23 player squad. The player database is reasonably large with most english players from the premiership to the conference league. 

The matches are presented with a 3D engine, where you watch the game from an isometric perspective.
