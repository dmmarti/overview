Using the many Dino's from the two Jurassic Park movies, you choose your type and fight it out one-on-one with other dinos to become the supreme Dino in the park.

Each arena represents a place in the two Jurassic Park movies, and there is a museum to visit, with info on all of the Dinosaurs that are in the game.

As usual, the more you complete, the more that becomes available, with new dino's to play with, new arenas and some new play modes.
