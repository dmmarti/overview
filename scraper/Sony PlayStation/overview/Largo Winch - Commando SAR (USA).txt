Largo Winch, playboy billionaire and international crime fighter, attends the opening of a new chemical factory in Venezuela when the complex is suddenly attacked by terrorists. They plant a bomb and take Tania Kournakova hostage, a journalist friend. Use a combination of stealth and hand-to-hand combat to infiltrate high tech offices, desert fortresses and a remote oil rig. Next to regular weapons, Largo can also use a brainwave scanner to scan the position and status of guards, a radio, and a toolbox to hack or modify electronic systems.

This third-person, stealth action game is based on the Belgian Largo Winch comic book series by Philippe Francq and Jean Van Hamme, edited by Dupuis.
