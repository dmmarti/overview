Fang was once a proud and rich city, until Baron Sukumvit took over. Under his rule, the city is known as the City of the Lost Souls. Deep inside the mountains surrounding the city, Baron Sukumvit built a labyrinth, named Deathtrap Dungeon, and used it to imprison his enemies. Filled with vulgarities, traps and disgusting monsters, the dungeon is a very dangerous place. With his enemies gone, the Baron now has opened up the dungeon to sport and sends willing heroes down into it's depths, betting on the likelihood of their survival.  If anyone could survive all levels of the dungeon, and slay the red dragon Melkor,  they would receive 10.000 gold pieces and Baron Sukumvit would renounce his rule over Fang. Two brave heroes: Red Lotus and Bandog, agree to these terms and enter the Deathtrap Dungeon...

Deathtrap Dungeon is a 3rd person action game. Controlling either Red Lotus or Bandog, the player controls the character from behind with a camera mode like in Tomb Raider. To deal with the enemies encountered,  there are three different kinds of attacks: melee weapons, range weapons and magic. The melee weapons include basic fists to normal swords to a magic enhanced war hammer. In the range weapons department are goodies like bombs or a flame-thrower. In terms of spells are magicks such as fireballs or rather crazy spells like the exploding pig. But the real challenge are of course the riddles, traps and abysses that are everywhere throughout the dungeon.

During the journey, players will encounter many locked doors, that require the finding of keys and devices. There are also potions that regenerate health or provide immunity against fire for a limited amount of time. There are also several treasures hidden in the dungeon, finding them will increase the player's score at the end of the level. The player can save this game during a level by finding the various save points.

The game also features the two multiplayer-modes: Deathmatch and Last Man Standing.
