Cute, green-haired yet halfwitted creatures Lemmings this time appear in a platform
game. As the only survivor Lemming that managed to rescue himself from the evil spell
of Evil Ed, you (Lomax) must stop Evil Ed's distracting effect over the LemmingLand.

In your quest most of your enemies will be Hench Lemmings which've been possessed
by Evil Ed's evil spell. You will be mainly using your spin attack or -when grabbed-
your magic helmet to free these imprisoned Lemmings from the spell.

You have also some special abilities like building a bridge, digging horizontally 
through certain obstacles (just like the other Lemmings games) or throwing a flaming
helmet that will help you to accomplish your goal.
