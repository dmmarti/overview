Seadoo HydroCross offers players five different models of fast maneuverable jet skis and eight varied courses on which to race them. Zip across the winding canals of Venice or speed through twisting sewers beneath Paris. For the truly adventurous jet skier there is even a Loch Ness course, complete with sea serpent. The game has two different physics model settings - a simulation mode for a realistic feel and an arcade mode for fast, forgiving gameplay.
