This iteration of Sculptured's baseball lineage  has real players and teams up to date at the time of production. You can play single matches, a full season, the playoffs, or an all-out action Home Run Derby. Team selection and transfers come under player control. Jim Hughson and Buck Martinez provide the commentary. This was the first version to support Internet play on the PC.
