Shao Lin is a Fighting game for the PlayStation. Duels take place in 3D fighting arenas. Between the fights you walk around in a typical J-RPG fashion in full 3D world. You can talk with various NPCs that populate the world. Some will challenge you to a duel, which has to be won in order to progress in the game. Duels aren't always one versus one, but can include multiple enemies. You start the game with a young character which will age throughout the story to an old man or woman. Eating at restaurants restores your health, but also has an effect on the look of your character. Sleeping at inns saves your game.

There are six different fighting styles you can master, with each their own sets of moves and animations. In multi-player you can opt to play with four friends and up to an additional four NPCs in versus mode or battle royal.
