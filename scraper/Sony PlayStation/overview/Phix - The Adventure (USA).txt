The Magnia Stone, the sacred stone of the Magnetic World is knocked off its floating altar in the sky and falls towards a slumbering creature called Phix. He swallows it and starts to attract metallic objects and creatures. This upsets the balance of the world, and evil creatures start to appear throughout the land. Phix must travel to five realms in order to bring the stone to its original place and return peace.

Phix: The Adventure is a 3D platform with a magnetic element similar to the earlier Super Magnetic Neo. The main character attracts or repels objects and enemies by switching polarity (between north and south with the ? button). Touching the enemy decreases the number of hearts at the left bottom of the screen. Falling on pits or water kills Phix instantaneously. The ? button shoots magnetic particles (enemies can be killed by particles of opposite polarity: north enemies are affected by south particles, and vice-versa). Pressing and holding the ¦ activates a neutral field that lasts some seconds and shields Phix from the magnetic activity around him. The X button makes the character jump. To reach higher places, Phix first must connect to magnetic spots on the ground by selecting the opposite polarity and then switch to the same polarity. Activating the neutral field at this exact moment makes him jump even higher.

The game has five worlds, each with three regular levels and a boss stage. It starts with two lives and a timer for each level (the character dies when it runs out), and allows progress to be saved to the memory card.
