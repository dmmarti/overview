Animaniacs: Ten Pin Alley is a bowling game, a sequel of sorts to Ten Pin Alley. The gameplay is basically the same: the player can choose from a selection of characters (this time from the Animaniacs cartoon) with varying statistics, or build a new character from the ground up. This character is then positioned with the digital pad facing the bowling lane and its pins. Pressing X starts the ball launch where the screen switches to a side view of the character holding the ball and three gauges appear: Two tricolored ones for speed and accuracy and a smaller green one for putting a spin on the ball. Initially, the player can fill the spin gauge by pressing both the digital pad and X. After some seconds, a fast meter starts to move on the other gauges. The objective is to press X when it reaches the yellow band on each gauge. If it misses this mark, the character fumbles and drops the ball.
