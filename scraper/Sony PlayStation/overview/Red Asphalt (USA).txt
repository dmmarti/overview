Red Asphalt is a racing and combat game with a post-apocalyptic futuristic theme.  There are a total of 24 tracks and players can choose from 6 characters. Each character has different driving skills, tactical skills and aggression skills. Players start out with a sum of money and can win additional cash by winning the races. Use the money to buy vehicles, 6 to choose from, and upgrade them with better engines, armor, tires, suspension and weapons.  It is a direct sequel to Rock'n Roll Racing, although it features a very different style and gameplay.
