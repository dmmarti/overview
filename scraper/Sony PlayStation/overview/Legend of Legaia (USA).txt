Legend of Legaia is a console RPG who's main innovation is its complex and unusual battle system.

Your initial party consists of three characters: Vahn, Noa, and Gala - two males and one female. You engage yourself on a quest of freeing your planet from a mysterious mist which is floating above the planet and which can turn anything it touches into a dreadful monster. In order to clean the planet from the horrible mist, you have to find so-called Genesis Trees which are scattered around on the planet. 

The combat system, which is probably the most original part of this game, isn't quite similar to the well-known menu-based Final Fantasy style. If you are familiar with the combat system of Xenogears, it's more similar to this one, but more complicated. Your choices aren't just attack, defend or use special abilities: the attack option itself has many choices: high-attack, low-attack, kick etc., a bit like in Revenant. Apart from this system, the game is a typical Asian console 3D RPG with manga characters, map-exploring, etc.
