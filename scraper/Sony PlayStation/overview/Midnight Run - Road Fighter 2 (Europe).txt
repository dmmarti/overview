Midnight Run: Road Fighter 2 is an arcade racer and a modern 3D sequel to Road Fighter.  Players can choose between four different colored cars and three different courses. The courses are the sunset trial (easy), the starlight heat (medium) or the midnight run (hard). You race on a single looped track against 3 rival cars competing for the first place. While racing the player must also reach check points for time extensions and pass as many cars as possible.
