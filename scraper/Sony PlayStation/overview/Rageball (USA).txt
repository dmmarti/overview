The futuristic sport of Rageball, inspired by Speedball 2, is fast, violent and deadly, and played by teams of exiled convicts who have nothing to lose. The year is 2612 and sports hit an all-time low. Therefore, prisoners are sent to the planet IS-326, nicknamed "The Hell", where they are forced to compete in a violent sport with no rules.

In the single player mode, you take on the role of the manager of an up-and-coming Rageball squad, as you coach the players to victory, with strategical decisions and tactics. Up to four competitors can battle against each other through multitap.
