The Mission’, offers gamers the opportunity to play as some of the greatest footballers in the world.

Using a selected team of two footballers, the player must battle and puzzle his way through over 24 levels of action, dispensing with fire-spitting demons and innumerable Ninjas trained in the martial arts along the way.
