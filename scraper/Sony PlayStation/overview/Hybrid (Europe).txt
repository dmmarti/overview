Hybrid is a 3D first-person shooter with a futuristic high-tech theme. Earth is on the the brink of collapse after years of fighting against an alien invasion, and you are among those who remain to fight. Your next mission is to strike a compound deep within the mountains. Choose from one of four characters: cybernetic commando George McKenzie, flame magic user Akiko Tyler, alien soldier Alien, or hard-boiled mercenary Bloodchaser Field. Use your guns and bombs to make your way through the complex and wipe out anything that moves.
