Cube shaped life forms from a parallel universe mistake bales of hay on a farm as captured cubes and Colonel Cubicles sends a demand to the chickens living there that all the cubes on the farm need to be freed. Failing to do this, the cube creatures kidnap all the baby chicks down a well which lead to their world. Now it's up to a chicken with superpowers, named Mort, to head down the well and rescue those baby chicks. The game is broken up into stages in which Mort goes around searching for the baby chicks to rescue. Once he collects the chicks, he has to return them to the well at the start of each stage. He must be careful of the block shaped enemies that are trying to impede his efforts. To attack his enemies, Mort can peck and comb whip them. Mort can also crack open eggs to find power-ups such as springs, invincibility, or even an ability to launch baby chickens at any of the enemies. If an enemy does hit Mort he will lose some health. To restore health, Mort can eat corn and beans which are strewn among the ground of each stage. Mort can also collect stars and coins which will increase the player's score.  In between each stage, two newscasters, Chicken Little and Henny Penny, give up-to-date commentary on current happenings which help move the story along.
