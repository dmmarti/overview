Build your own theme park, with all the roller coasters, rides, food stalls and anything else you can think of.

You change every aspect of each and every ride, event and stall that you place inside your park, from colors to the length of each ride, the amount of people on at a time, and how many fries are in a pack of chips (ok, maybe not that much detail, but you get the point).

The roller coasters are always the main events, and after you complete the construction, you can ride the coaster in a first person view, just to see the game from the view point of the customers.
