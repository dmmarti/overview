From the makers of Balls of Steel and Devil's Island Pinball comes this title based on the popular Austin Powers movies.

Two tables are included - one based on International Man of Mystery, and the other based on The Spy Who Shagged Me.  Tables can be played in either full-screen or scrolling mode.  Sound effects and dot-matrix animations are taken from the movies, while the music is merely in the same style.  And here comes the obligatory tagline - groovy baby, yeah!
