Enter the world of Dragon Seeds!  As a Dragonsage you will need to genetically engineer, and train (essentially "ranch") your dragons for armed combat.  Plus, you can use memory card data from any game to create high powered dragons.  Dragon Seeds features a simple, RPG-like battle interface, tons of weapons and shields, and a two-player mode.
