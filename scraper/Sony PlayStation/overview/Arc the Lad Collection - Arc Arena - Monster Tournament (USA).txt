Arc the Lad Monster Game is a spin-off from the Arc the Lad series and a bonus expansion to Arc the Lad II, as it uses the player's saves from the second game so the player can compete in the tournament with his monsters, visit shops, trade items etc. In addition there is a collection of casino mini-games that complete the package.
