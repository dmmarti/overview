One of the first few games to be developed by SCEE's internal studio, this official basketball simulation is endorsed by the NBA, and features all of the teams from the '97 season. The game features real player likenesses, names and stats. There is also the facility to create customised players.

The usual range of Season play, Tournaments and Exhibition modes can be found. A host of tactical options can be set-up, and 'special moves' are there to discover. The game supports multiplayer modes of up to 8 players.
