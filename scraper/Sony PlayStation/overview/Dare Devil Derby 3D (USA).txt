Dare Devil Derby 3D is a cartoonish-type of destruction derby that lets the player take control of 8 unique characters and over 30 different tracks, ranging from jungles, canyons, city streets, underwater, outer space and various other three dimensionally rendered terrain.  Power-ups can also be picked up and used to give more power and speed to a players car or even a weapon to knock out rivals.

There are a plethora of single player modes, ranging from single one on one races to Knockouts, which consisted of a demolition derby where the winner was the last car still operable.  There is also a grand prix mode where the player races in a series of 10 races and required to finish in the top 3 in order to advance to the next.  At the end of these 10 races, if a player meets a requirement of points they can then compete in a World Series of Racing to become champion.

Eight friends can also go against each other simultaneously utilizing the multi-tap adapter.
