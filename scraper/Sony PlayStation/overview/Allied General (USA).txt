The sequel to Panzer General and second release in SSI's 5-Star General series. This time you play World War 2 from the Allied point of view. Both, Western Allies and Soviet Forces, can be played (Pacific theatre is not included). The game interface is only slightly enhanced, unit and map graphics are the same as in its predecessor.
