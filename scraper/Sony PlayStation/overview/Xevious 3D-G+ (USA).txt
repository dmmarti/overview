Xevious 3D/G+ is a compilation of four titles: Xevious 3D/G (main game), Xevious (Arcade version), Super Xevious (Arcade version) and Xevious Arrangement.  A fighter pilot flying the Solvalou space ship is the last hope for the Earth. Invaders from the planet Xevious have arrived; being descendants of our planet's original inhabitants, they wish to reclaim it for themselves. The Xevians started to build huge ground structures, and it is the hero's job to destroy them while shooting at their space ships and detonating the treacherous SOL bases.  Xevious 3D/G+ puts the classic arcade vertical shoot 'm up Xevious game in a third-person 3D perspective. The game brings some new weapon systems to the player-controlled fighter jet and contains many new enemies, some of which are quite large and pose new challenges to the player. During the game the player can collect three types of power-ups: bullets, lasers and plasma beams.
