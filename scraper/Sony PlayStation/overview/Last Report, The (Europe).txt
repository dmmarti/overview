Evidence: The Last Report is a detective adventure, in which you play Daniel Singer, a reporter for Channel Z. Your former girlfriend and co-worker Sarah Hopkins has been murdered and because you recently broke up with her, you are considered to be the prime suspect. You have a few hours to discover the real killer and your job isn’t easy, as there are people in high places involved that will try to stop you.  Evidence is a point-and-click adventure with some real-time 3D action scenes that can be skipped. Those include shoot-em-up and beat-em-up sequences, and boat and car races.
