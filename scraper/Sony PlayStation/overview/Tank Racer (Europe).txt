Tank Racer is a mixed driving and shooting game in which you race tanks through various courses.
There are 15 normal and secret tanks to choose from, and a total of 22 different maps from a quiet English village to a spooky New Orleans swamp, a bustling Eastern European city to the controlled, sterile atmosphere of a biosphere!
