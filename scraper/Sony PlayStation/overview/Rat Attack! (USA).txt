Play as one of the Scratch Cats, an elite superhero team, who are out to save the world from Washington and Jefferson, two evil mutant space rats who wish to enslave the world in rats.

Explore each puzzle level and wipe out the rat threat. First you need to catch the rat, using the Eraticator. Then you must find the Destructor pad in each level in order for the rat to be taken out. Each level has a quota of rats you must remove, and if you fail to do so within the time limit (which, in this case, is when the rats destroy everything in the level), you lose.
