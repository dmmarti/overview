NCAA Final Four 2000 allows you to control one of 300 Division One basketball teams (the game uses real licensed teams), in either a single game, just the tournament, or though an entire season. One of the new features for this release is "touch shooting". When making a shot, a meter comes up. Leave the meter in the right spot, and you're more likely to make the shot. The game engine has also been improved and in-game commentary is provided by Quinn Buckner.

Other enhancements include playbooks and AI focused on scrambles and team play typical of college games. The player models have been created using motion capture.
