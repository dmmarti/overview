One of the earliest in Konami's franchise, this version featured 300 actual MLB players at the time, but did not feature the MLB licensed teams.  Players can choose to either play against a friend in Exhibition, Season or Playoffs.  The gameplay is geared for more of a simulation style of play with the players stats determining on how well they hit, pitch and field.

Along with the standard modes for a baseball game, this one also featured the ability to customize their teams and choose any player to create their "Dream Team".  It also had a variety of different camera angles to choose from and had meters to show their players progress such as a "Streak Bar" that showed a batters hitting ability and a "Pitching Bar" that showed whether a pitcher was fatigued.
