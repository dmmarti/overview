Black Dawn fulfills a few childhood dreams by putting gamers in control of a military helicopter.

Assigned to a variety of campaigns, you must fly the AH-69 Mohawk (sounds like something Jan-Michael Vincent from AIRWOLF would pilot) as you battle through enemy territory across different global locales.
