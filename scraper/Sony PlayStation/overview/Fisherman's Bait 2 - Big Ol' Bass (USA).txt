The sequel to Fisherman's Bait allows you to fish for over fifteen different types of fish, using twenty different fishing spots and many different lures. The game features five game modes: Beginner, Free Fishing, Tournament, Versus Play and World Monster mode. The beginner mode teaches the player the basics, while the Free Fishing mode can be used to hone their skills at their own leisure. In the tournament you have to qualify in three lakes to participate. Versus Play allows you to compete against a friend and Monster mode features out-of-proportion fish in fictional environments.
