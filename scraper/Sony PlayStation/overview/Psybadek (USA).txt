In Psybadek, you maneuver a hoverboard through jungle, desert, underworld and ice levels as Xako or Mia to save your friends trapped by an evil overlord. While more action oriented than racing, the game encourages you to pull off tricks and speed, all the while collecting stars and solving the odd puzzle.
