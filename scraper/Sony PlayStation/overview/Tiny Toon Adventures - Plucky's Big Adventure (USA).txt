In this adventure game based on the Tiny Toon cartoons, the player starts to control Plucky Duck, and needs to assemble a time machine, subsequently travelling through time to rescue the world from Montana Max' evil plans.

Typical adventure game puzzles involve finding the parts for a time machine (in the form of a bike) etc. Later in the game, control is diverted to Buster Bunny, Hampton and Babs Bunny, allowing for complex multi location puzzles.

The game has no voiceover, but displays large amounts of text in speech bubbles. Progress is saved on memory card.
