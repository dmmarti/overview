Wayne Gretzky's 3D Hockey '98 is basically the same game as its predecessor with only a few minor changes such a updated teams and new statistics.  The game offers two basic playing options: simulation and arcade. While simulation tries to be relatively realistic (but still relatively fast-paced in comparison to similar games), the arcade mode ignores penalties and features a power shot. The player may either participate in exhibition matches, a whole season, play-offs or practice. Thanks to the official NHL and NHLPA licenses, there are 26 teams with real-life athletes available.
