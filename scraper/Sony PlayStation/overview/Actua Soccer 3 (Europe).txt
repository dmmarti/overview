Arcade football action is recreated using motion captured graphics. As well as creating a custom tournament, you can play any of 25 leagues, with a total of 450 teams and 10,000 players featured. You can create your own squad, or customise the existing ones by trading and editing players. Tactics can be refined based on formation, defensive style and attacking approach. Realistic weather effects are incorporated into both appearance and gameplay. Barry Davies and former Celtic manager Martin O'Neill are the commentators.
