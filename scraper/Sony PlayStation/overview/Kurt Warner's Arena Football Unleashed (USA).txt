Kurt Warner's Arena League Unleashed is a modified version of NFL Blitz set in the Arena Football League.  Arena ball is a version of American football played indoors on a 50 yard field with nets behind each endzone and boards on the sidelines.

KWALU is a six on six game (real arena ball is eight on eight) with no penalties so post tackle stomping and dog piles are encouraged.  All 16 teams from the 1999 season are represented including Kurt's former team, the Iowa Barnstormers.
