You are Jack Fremont, an ordinary schmo just trying to get enough money to eat something (by banging on your fridge, yelling "I'm hungry!") when you are caught in a big-city crime ring and hired by the CIA to be an incompetent spy (crude personality, not too bright...) which leads to hilarity and action alike. This game plays like an interactive movie, with a point-and click in the movie interface.
