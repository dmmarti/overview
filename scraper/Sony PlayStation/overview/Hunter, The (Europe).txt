Players battle malfunctioning robots guards and horrendously mutated creatures to recover the lost technology of a near-future Earth in the action-oriented role-playing adventure Battle Hunter, for the enduring PlayStation console. Civilization as we know it was wiped out in the Third World War and the few scientists who survive in the aftermath struggle to make use of their skills to bring humanity back from the brink of extinction before it is too late. As one of several competing "Hunters," the player quests through dangerously twisted post-apocalyptic lands in search of important technological relics and the bounties they will bring. It’s the very near future, and a gigantic war has wiped out much of mankind. The scientists who remain on the Earth’s surface want to create a formula to bring humanity back from the brink of extinction, but they’ll need important information that’s stored in the vaults of the world’s largest cities. The mission of retrieving the facts has been assigned to a highly skilled task force called the Hunters, and you’re among their elite. Compete with other Hunters and avoid deadly environmental elements as you try to become the first post-war hero by delivering the secrets to the right hands. Packed with hidden levels, special relics, and awesome power-ups, Battle Hunter (known as The Hunter in Europe) pits you against evil robots, mutated animals, and even some of your own friends! Battle Cards will help you get a leg up on the competition, and awesome action physics make the gameplay smooth and realistic. If you’re looking for an original challenge that lives up to its premise, check out BATTLE HUNTER.
