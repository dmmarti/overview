This is a 3D action/adventure titled based on the pioneering computer animated cartoon "ReBoot". It's an over-the-shoulder perspective shooter comprised of 19 complex levels filled with diverse enemies. The story in ReBoot PSX is conveyed through the linear video: an original episode of ReBoot created just for the game and positioned as episode 0 of the TV series (i.e. a prequel).
