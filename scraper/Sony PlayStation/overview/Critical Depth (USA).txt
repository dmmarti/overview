A new spin on the whole vehicular combat genre- this one takes place underwater, and features freedom of movement throughout the ocean, instead of being land-bound like its brethren.

Portals have opened up all over the world's oceans- to open each portal, you have to collect 5 pods, while fending off the competition using whatever means necessary.  Once opened, each portal takes you to the next level...

...features mission-based levels, arena-battles, and a Vs. mode.
