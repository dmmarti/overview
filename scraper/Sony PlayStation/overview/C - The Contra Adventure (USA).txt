C: Contra Adventure is a sequel to some of Konami's earlier Contra classics. 

The game's story follows the events of Contra: Legacy of War. It follows Ray, the only surviving member of the Contra task force (who is originally from Contra: Hard Corps), fighting an alien invasion in the jungles of South America.

All the innovations that were introduced in Contra: Legacy of War are maintained in this game: memory card saving, hit-points, three-dimensional fire fights. However, the gameplay varies depending on the level and perspective used.

The nine levels are a combination of mostly overhead with some side scrolling, and third person 3D.  For a different twist in one of the levels your character is weightless.

City Rescue - sidescrolling 
Village - third-person 3-d 
Canyon - overhead 
Pyramid - third-person 3-d
Weightless - Sidescrolling
Hunting - third-person 3-d 
Alien Lair - sidescrolling 

The weapons are the standard laser, machine gun and spread weapon.  You can carry multiple weapons and in this version of the game you can take multiple hits before dying.
