3rd Person Action game based on the hit comic book from J.Scott Campbell.

In Danger Girl, you play as one of three sexy, adventurous, feminine agents with a wide array of weapons and spy gear. Choose between Abbey Chase, the blond team leader; Sydney, a sharpshooter from Australia; and a character who is new to the series. You'll travel all over the world in 14 levels and explore vast outdoor and indoor areas in six different environments. The game features a wide variety of play mechanics and numerous prerendered interstitial scenes that advance a story line that takes place between the first and second story arcs of the comic book.
