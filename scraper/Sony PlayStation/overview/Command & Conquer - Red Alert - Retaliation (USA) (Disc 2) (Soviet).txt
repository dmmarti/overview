Command & Conquer: Red Alert - Retaliation combines the campaigns seen in the Command & Conquer: Red Alert PC add-ons Counterstrike and The Aftermath, into one complete game for the PlayStation. It also continues the same storyline seen in the original Red Alert.

New additions include specially produced cut-scenes, an improved interface for the control pad users, and a special two player mode (where you can plug in two PlayStations together using the link cable and two TVs. Insert one of the disks into one of the consoles, and you can play a 2 player version of C&C, with 100 different missions to play).
