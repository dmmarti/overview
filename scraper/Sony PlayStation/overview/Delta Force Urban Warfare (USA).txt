Delta Force: Urban Warfare is an urban-themed first-person shooter in the Delta Force series. Set in a variety of city locations, the player takes the role of an elite US army Special Forces soldier, using a variety of weapons to tackle missions as diverse as foiling a bank robbery, and rescuing hostages from terrorist forces.

The player must learn to use the full range of weapons at their disposal, and special equipment such as nightvision and heat-sensing goggles. Some tactical thinking is needed to get through, with good use of cover, and the subtle use of light and dark areas is essential.
