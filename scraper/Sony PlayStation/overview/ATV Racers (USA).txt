ATV Racers features a variety of animals who are out to win an ATV racing championship through means of vehicular combat racing. The game features a Tournament, Arcade, and Time Trial mode.  In tournament mode, players get to choose one of the 10 (8 are selectable from the start and 2 are unlockable) animal racers to race with. The tournament offers three different sets of trophy races; the cross cup, dune cup, and the rock cup. Each cup consists of 3 different racetracks; underground, red rock, and atlantis. These 3 racetracks get altered depending on what cup the player is competing for.  When racing, players attempt to beat the five opponents they are up against to the finish line. To help achieve this goal, players can shoot guided rockets, use speed boosts, and lay mines to hinder their opponents. The higher the position the player gets in a race, the more points they earn. The player with the most points after all the races are done wins the championship cup.  Arcade lets the player compete on any of the available tracks so they can practice racing on them. Time Trial lets the player race solo, trying to defeat a track in as little time as possible.  Options include setting the difficulty level (easy or medium), setting the number of laps (3, 5, 9 or 50), and whether to turn vibration on or off.
