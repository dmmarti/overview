The era of dinosaurs is no longer what it used to be After a continuous period of meteorite showers and other natural catastrophes, the kings of the planet have given way to their offspring. These now find themselves left to their own devices, and set off on a search for a better life. It is time to build a new kingdom where their life will be peaceful.However, they have a long way to go. Quarrels between clans are raging, and our heroes are threatened by many dangers. However, this all remains at the level of our baby dinosaurs. They have transformed our little blue planet into a huge playground... In the end, only one will dominate. He will be the master, the chosen one who will have to establish a new equilibrium. Under the control of our cute baby dinosaurs, this world of jungles, volcanoes and mountains has given way to a world where fun and humor are omnipresent. Challenge your friends in arenas which are ever more hilarious, with the help of lots of little monsters, each more fun than the last ! Dinomaster Party gives players a chance to control one of eight young dinosaurs, including a baby T-Rex, Diplodocus, Triceratops, and Velociraptor. The parents of these babies have disappeared, and the kids are competing in a series of games to determine who will be boss. The games include Dino Square (sprints), Rock Push (pushing other characters out of a ring), Meteor Shower (competing for a safe spot in the sheltering caves), and Free-for-all (an arena punching competition).
