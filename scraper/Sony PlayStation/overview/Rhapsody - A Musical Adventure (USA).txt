In this game, you control Cornet, a young orphaned girl who can animate lifeless puppets playing on her trumpet. One day, Cornet meets prince Ferdinand and falls in love with him. She joins a contest, the winner of which will have the privilege to marry the prince. But in the middle of the contest, an evil sorceress bursts in and kidnaps the prince. Now Cornet and her friends must defeat the sorceress and rescue the prince.

The game is in a certain way a parody on typical "save-the-princess" RPG stories, because here you are almost a princess yourself, and it is the prince who requires saving. Instead of FMVs the game uses musical performances to advance the story of the game, which makes it a kind of "game-musical". The battles are turn-based and remind those of strategy RPGs: you move around the battle field, and your attack should be in a proper range to hit the enemy.
