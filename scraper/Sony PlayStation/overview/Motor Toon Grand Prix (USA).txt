In Motor Toon Grand Prix (Motor Toon Grand Prix 2 in Japan), all the familiar characters are back in Sony's sequel to Motor Toon Grand Prix. Very much like Mario Kart this game offers multiple worlds and tracks along with crazy characters and plenty of power-ups for some wild racing.

The available characters are Captain Rock, Princess Jean, Bolbox, Raptor&Raptor, Penguin Bros., Vanity, Billy the Tough and Ching Tong Shang. The colorful worlds are Toon Village, Toon Island 2, Crazy Coaster, Gulliver House 2 and the Haunted Castle.

The Championship mode takes you through all five tracks. For practice you can select from a single race, time attack and free run. You can even play back your races in the Replay Theater. 

The game includes a second disc for a two-player mode where you can link two separate playstations together. While racing, there are 17 power-ups to take out the competition: Bomb, FireBall, Jump, Missile, Crazy Mushroom, Dynamite, 32t Weight, Stealth Field, Turbo, Big Bigger Biggest, Tiny Tiny Tiny, Oil Can, Pandora's Box, Wonder Clock, Magic Hand, Power Up, Super Shield.
