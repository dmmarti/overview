Gold and Glory: The Road to El Dorado is an adventure game very much similar to Monkey Island. This game is based on the Dreamworks cartoon with the same title and has quite the same story as the cartoon: Two lads from Spain are about to go into prison, but they don't want to, so they escape by going onto a ship and search for the legendary City of Gold, El Dorado.
