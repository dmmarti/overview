Contender is an arcade-style boxing game that challenges you to fight your way through three leagues (Local, National and World) in your quest to win the World Championship. The Main Event lets players choose between eight boxers, each differing in life (strength), power, speed and endurance. You'll then have to rise through the ranks and fend off challengers trying to make names for themselves. There are over 40 different boxers in total, including both male and female fighters with unique fighting styles. Building up your boxer's ratings is accomplished through winning bouts and sparring with your trainer Jackal, who may even teach you a few special moves! Seven different camera angles include two first-person views as well as more traditional third-person perspectives. Options include toggling Super Punches, adjusting the game's speed, choosing one of three levels of difficulty (Rookie, Amateur and Professional) and whether or not the TKO rule is enforced. Besides the Main Event, players can elect to take part in an Exhibition Fight or Tournament, where 32 fighters compete through five rounds. Contender supports Dual Shock Analog Controllers for vibration feedback and memory cards for saving both league progress and your boxer's statistics.
