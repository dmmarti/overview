The Swagman, a baddie from The Terrortories, has imprisoned the Dreamflight fairies so no one can wake up from their nightmares. It's the Swagman's plan to unleash his horde of minions and take over the world, unless two eight year-olds, Zac and Hannah, can stay awake long enough to stop him.

This is a character based adventure game with puzzle and platform elements.
