Caesars Palace II is an update of the NES title where once again the player is given $1,000 to either make a fortune from it or bust and go home empty handed.

Once again the stage is set at the historic Caesars Palace and has 19 different games to play in including Craps, Blackjack, Roulette, Video poker, Slot Machines among many others and gambling wins and losses including stats are kept to show the player how well or how poorly they are doing.
