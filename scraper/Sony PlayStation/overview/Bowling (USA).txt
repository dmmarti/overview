A simulation of the classic game of the same name. As you can imagine from the name, this is a no-frills game, but it still comes with three modes, (normal, special, and quest) and multiplayer options. (1-4 players, with computer players as desired.)

Normal mode is the regular bowling game, but special mode sets up 45 pins instead of the usual 10. Quest mode, on the other hand, randomly places 3 pins in the lane, creating a more strategic play.
