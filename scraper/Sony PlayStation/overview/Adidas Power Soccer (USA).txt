adidas Power Soccer is a sports game which simulates soccer. While it has the option to play in simulation mode, it is best remembered for the Arcade mode and the trademark move of the game - the Predator Shot (named after the most popular brand of boots manufactured by the German company). In this mode, all special moves are unlocked, and some of them allow to go way beyond what rules allow.

4 cameras allow to follow the motion-captured action in the best way possible. Commentary is available in English, German and French.
