This is Ankh-Morpork, a city surrounded by darkness, where the cold river Ankh flows, where it is always raining, and where dwarves and trolls co-exist with mysterious societies, religious fanatics, stupid police captains, and bar pianists. It is also where a bitterly sarcastic sharp-eyed PI Lewton tries to earn a living solving bizarre cases. A mysterious woman named Carlotta hires him to find her lost lover. Wandering through the dark city and gathering evidence, Lewton has to solve the case, confront a sinister conspiracy, and once again become torn between love and despair.

"Discworld Noir" differs from other Discworld games not only because of its much more serious tone and dark Film Noir-style atmosphere, but also because of its gameplay. Instead of inventory-based puzzles there are clues, which Lewton writes down in his notebook and which should be then used whenever there is a connection between the clue and the situation in question.
