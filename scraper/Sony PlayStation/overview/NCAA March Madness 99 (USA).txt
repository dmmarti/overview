This basketball game lets the player choose from 107 Division 1 men's teams, 16 Division 1 women's teams (the top 16 from the 1998 season), and 20 of the all-time great men's teams from the past. The license from the NCAA allows for the team's names to be real, but no player's names are allowed, although the players on the teams mimic the real jersey number's and skills of their real life counterparts.
