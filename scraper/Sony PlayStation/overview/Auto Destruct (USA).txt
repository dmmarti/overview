Auto Destruct involves mission-based car combat.  Unlike similar titles such as Destruction Derby and Twisted Metal, this doesn't focus on arena-type face-offs with multiple opponents.

Sometime in the near future, your family is killed by a mysterious cult.  You join an underground organization dedicated to annihilating this cult, and are outfitted with an armed car (customizable to an extent).  The 25 missions vary, from simple search-and-destroy rounds to escort missions and defense missions.
