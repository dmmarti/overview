Shanghai: True Valor is a 3D puzzler based on the classic Oriental games Mah Jong and Shanghai. Each game starts off with a stack of tiles arranged in a pyramid shape. In order to win, the player is required to match up tiles by finding "free" tiles of the same type. For instance, some tiles have numbers and some have pictures; the object is to find a tile not restricted, blocked, or under another tile. Once a player matches up two tiles of the same type, they are removed and the pyramid is reduced. By removing tiles, previously restricted tiles may be opened up. Gameplay flows in this fashion until there are no more tiles or a stalemate. Stalemates are very common and occur when there are no possible matches or moves remaining. Shanghai features two game modes, Classic and Arcade with an option for two-player split screen action. In the Classic mode, the traditional tile game is played from a 3D viewpoint. To get a better view of the free or restricted tiles, the camera can be rotated around the pyramid. The Arcade mode is a bit different in that it features game modifications. Going up against the computer AI or a second player, you choose a character and pick a variation of the classic game, such as playing with four sets of tiles on a rotating cube. The two-player head-to-head feature involves removing tiles and finding power-ups, like Tetrisphere for the Nintendo 64. The game features an online rules listing that can be accessed any time from the menu system. Additionally, players can customize time limits and the tile sets from the options screen. Shanghai: True Valor also supports the PlayStation Mouse for better control of the cursor.
