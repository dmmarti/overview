The American football game contains all the licensed NFL teams, all the players (over 1500 of them) and schedules. Players choose between multiplayer mode or single player mode versus computer AI. Games can be played individually, or players can compete against a series of randomly chosen opponents in the Playoff games. Camera angles can be changed to numerous 3D views that simulate the looks of real television coverage, with a special first-person view also included. Adding to the realism is a simulated voice announcer. The player animations are motion-captured.
