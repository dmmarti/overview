A go-kart racing game based on the popular cartoon character Woody Woodpecker.

Select one of 6 starting characters from the series (including 3 different styled Woodys, Wally Walrus and others) and race in a style reminiscent of Super Mario Kart (including "jump turns" for sharper angles).

Collect items from boxes and try to slow down your opponents as you drive through a 3D environment, with slopes, ramps and jumps, on tarmac or mud.

Select either quest, championship, time trial or single race as you try to hone your skills and unlock new characters and tracks.
