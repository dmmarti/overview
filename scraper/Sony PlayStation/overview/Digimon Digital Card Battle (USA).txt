In this Cyber World, everything revolves around Digital Card Battles.  People from all over the world log-in to collect Cards and challenge each other to Card Battles.

To play, Card Tamers create Decks of 30 Cards, using Digimon and special Option Cards that match their personal strategies.  The winner of a Card Battle earns new Cards.

As a Card Tamer, you should create a Deck that suits your playing style and use it to challenge your friends.
