Bomberman returns to PlayStation for a bargain hurrah with Bomberman: Party Edition. This version of the seminal multiplayer game keeps it simple and classic.  The game features 2D backdrops, bombs, players, and that's about it.  Grab this game, a multi-tap, and some friends, and bomb away like the halcyon days of yore. You'll travel through the familiar grid-like levels, nabbing power-ups as you try and obliterate the competition.
