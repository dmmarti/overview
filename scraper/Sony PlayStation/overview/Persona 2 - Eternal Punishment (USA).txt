In Eternal Punishment, you play the role of Maya Amano, a young journalist who lives and works in a modern-day Japanese city called Sumaru. A series of mysterious murders have been troubling the city lately. Maya has to make a report and goes to a high school where the murders have taken place, together with a fortune-teller Ulala and a detective Katsuya. When they arrive at the school, they find the principal murdered. A man appears - a man with a bag on his head, who calls himself "The Joker". He says Maya and her friends will never defeat him unless they call upon their Personae - their other selves who can appear as mythical figures and help them in battles. The investigation continues, but now the young people have to face real demons... and perhaps the demons that live within their own hearts?

Eternal Punishment belongs to the Megami Tensei (Megaten) universe, and like in all Megaten games, it allows you to communicate with the random enemies. You can choose a party member to talk to the demons you encounter, flatter them, threaten them, make them give you Tarot cards that will allow you to summon more powerful Personae, or make contract with them in order to get information or rare items. You can also spread rumors around the city and see how they influence its life.

This is a direct sequel to the game  Persona 2: Innocent Sin.
