An update to Gunship 2000. This updated game now includes full textures on all 3D objects. The game features two game modes. The Quick Fire game mode has the player piloting a helicopter, trying to take out as many enemy targets as they can.

There is also a campaign mode where players can tackle various day and night missions in either Central Europe or the Persian Gulf. Missions range from destroying enemy convoys to taking out enemy platoons. Players start out as a greenhorn and can only do training or single scenario missions at first. The player can eventually get promoted to campaign scenario missions where they can also get to control a complete squad of five copters.

The game features flyable versions of the AH-64A Apache, UH-60K Blackhawk, AH-66B Comanche and four other authentic U.S. Army attack helicopters. Copters can be equipped with unguided weapons like rockets and machine guns and guided weapons like Hellfire, Sidewinder, and Stinger missiles which are used to take out both air and ground targets. Copters can be flown from either a cockpit view or from a chase view. The game also has other camera views such as the remote view or the tactical view.
