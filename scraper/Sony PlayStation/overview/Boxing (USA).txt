The aptly-title Boxing is a relatively simple budget boxing game. The game offers an arcade-style boxing experience with ten colorful characters to choose from. Three modes are available: Ranking Mode, which has you fighting to become the top ranked boxer in the world; Scout Mode, which has you seeking new talent in order to unlock characters; and Battle Mode, where two players can fight an exhibition match against each other.
