A group of high-school students decides to visit their sick friend, Mary. But once they exit the girl's room in the hospital, they see their home town has changed. They can't leave it, and it is infested by demons. At first, it seems that the giant Sebec corporation and its manager Guido are the ones responsible for the terrible accident. But Guido is not the only one the young heroes have to confront - they must look deep into their hearts, and perhaps find the truth there...

Persona is the beginning of a sub-series in the Megaten universe, and one of the few Megaten games to be released outside of Japan. Like all Megaten games, Persona makes it possible to contact demons during random battles. In this game, demons can award the player with a spell card. If the player combines spell cards from different demons they can fuse more powerful creatures (personae), which can then attach to player characters, changing their parameters, strengths and weaknesses, and teaching them new spells. While important locations are isometric, dungeons are explored from a first-person perspective.
