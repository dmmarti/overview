A 3D puzzle game where you across a gridded landscape (Tron-cycle like) leaving a coloured trail behind you. Any square on the landcsape that you managed to colour on all sides gets claimed by you and earns you points. You're up against a varied number of opponents and the game covers about 50 levels, with the landscapes having different properties and shapes (e.g spherical world landscape). Add to this a bunch of pickups and bonus abilities, and you've got a retro- puzzle game that's a bit fun.
