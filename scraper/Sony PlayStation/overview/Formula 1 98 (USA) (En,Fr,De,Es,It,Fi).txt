All 22 drivers and 16 tracks from the 1998 Formula One season are included in this racing game. It has an Arcade mode & a realistic Grand Prix mode, with car setups and trickier handling. Split-screen and four-player link options are offered. There is a new in-car view and more overall camera views than before. A rear-view mirror is available as a separate view, triggered by holding a d-pad button. This version adds the ability to tour the track, with TV analyst and former driver Martin Brundle directing you. Brundle and TV legend Murray Walker commentate on the races.
