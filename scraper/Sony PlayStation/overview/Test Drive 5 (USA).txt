In this installment of the Test Drive series, you get to burn rubber in 28 vehicles from both recent and classic eras, including the classic Ford Mustang, Aston Martin Vantage, and more. You will be doing some wild jumps and having some big contact in these.

Race against other cars in 17 locations ranging from Russia to Hawaii. To further challenge you, they include shortcuts and alternate pathways, as well as police, variable weather effects and civilian cars. A heavy rock soundtrack spurs you on.
