From the same team that developed Porsche Challenge for the PlayStation, this is a high-speed racer where the user controls a number of adrenaline-pumping speedboats.

Choose from a selection of teams and powerboats, with lightning fast gameplay and true handling dynamics, so be careful how you accelerate and turn - these things aren't as stable as cars.

The game has a number of different game modes, (including championships - battling against 20 other competitors),  bonus games, and multiplayer modes.
