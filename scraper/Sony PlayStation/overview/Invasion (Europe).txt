The game begins in 17-October-2093 when an alien army (the Keseits) enter the solar system and in a brief battle they defeated the Earth armies. After the attack weapons, items and pilots are really few, and as being one of the few members of the resistance (called El Roy) the player will have to pilot his ship through different missions to destroy the aliens forces. The gameplay is a classic 3D shooter with different camera angles and a high difficulty level.
