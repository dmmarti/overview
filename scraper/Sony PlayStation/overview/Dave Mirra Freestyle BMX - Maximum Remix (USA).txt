This is the original Dave Mirra Freestyle BMX but it adds 8 new levels, new music, new challenges for the original 12 levels, new characters and a soundtrack to the game comes with it.

The basic play is as follows: Grind, jump, and pull tricks like never before in 20 free roaming levels across 5 environments: Hometown, Greenville, Woodward, Pro Tour, and the Acclaim Max Games. Some levels give you challenges, such as to jump something, pull a certain spin, etc. The other levels are "competition runs" where you have 2 minutes to perform a cool runs with the greatest of tricks up your sleeve. There are many, many secrets in this game.
