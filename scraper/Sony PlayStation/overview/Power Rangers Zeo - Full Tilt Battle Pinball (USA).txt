Pinball, a game that has been around since the 1930s, has been translated into video game format once again, this time via the Mighty Morphing Power Rangers, those multi-colored ninja heroes of low-budget television. Comprised of 5 different 3D play fields, this one-player simulation takes place in fifteen locations around the world, including Japan, New York, and Africa. Each play field consists of the usual pinball trappings such as ramps, targets, flippers, bumpers, and multi-ball specials. Before and between each level of play, a cinematic storyline plays out involving the invasion of Earth by aliens and the Power Ranger's attempts at stopping this dreaded scourge. Along with the Rangers, several other characters from this juggernaut franchise are featured including: Zeo Zords, King Mondo, and Queen Machina.
