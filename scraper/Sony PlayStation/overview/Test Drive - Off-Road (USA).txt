The Test Drive series of racing games traditionally involve driving cars on tarmac. However, a sub-series of games involving hazardous racing on less prepared surfaces was commenced with this title.

Choose from one of four monster trucks (Hummer, Land Rover Defender 90, Jeep Wrangler, and Chevrolet K-1500 Z71), each of which has its own handling as well as realistic damage modeling. Take them through 12 tracks incorporating sand, snow and dirt. In the single-player mode your task is to progress through increasing challenging leagues. 

An assortment of camera angles are supplied to play from. 3 exclusive remixes of Industrial band Gravity Kills make up the soundtrack. Up to four drivers can race against each other.
