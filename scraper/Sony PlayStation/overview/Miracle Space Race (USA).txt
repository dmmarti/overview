In Miracle Space Race, you choose from one of six different characters to try to win one of three available space kart tournaments. You have several weapons to choose from, including missiles, mines, turbo boosts and shields.

The game also features unlockable characters as you progress through the stages and levels. Also included are an Arcade mode (play through any race level you've already unlocked), and Time Trial mode (try to beat your own race records!)
