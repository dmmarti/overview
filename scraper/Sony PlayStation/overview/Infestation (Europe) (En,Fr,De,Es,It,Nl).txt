In the game you drive an upgradeable buggy, an experimental vehicle, named ACAM. It can be transformed into six different shapes; you can turn it into an aircraft, or even a hovercraft. You have to shoot aliens with flashy weapons, collect resources such as Crystals, Energy Spheres and lost scientists. So you as single human hero must put evil aliens in their place and introduce them to his plasma cannon.
