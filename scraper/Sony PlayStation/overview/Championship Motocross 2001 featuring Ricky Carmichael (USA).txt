This motocross game offers 9 customizable dirt bikes in three categories: 125cc, 250cc and 250cc. The six main modes include championship, split-screen head-to-head, single races and time attack modes. There are 12 tracks available and these have been divided into motocross, supercross and endure tracks, both indoor and outdoor, with different surfaces. On top of that, each course can also be reversed. An additional touch is added by dynamic weather effects.

Each bike, with different performances, can be fully tuned based on suspension, brakes, gears, tires... If racing for the finish line is not enough, you can also perform stunts with the trick system to wow the spectators. As the game’s title implies, you are able to race as or against motocross star Ricky Carmichael.
