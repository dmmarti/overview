Match the moves shown on-screen in this Simon-like game to dance.  Keep up with the continuing commands and your persona will be able to do combos and other fancy moves.  Dance different styles as a disco throwback, a breakdancer, a robot, and others, either alone or with a partner.  When dancing with a partner, coordination is important so you can gain a clear lead on him.  When dancing together each character gets an opportunity for a dance solo.  Don't waste it as it's a great time to rack up points.
