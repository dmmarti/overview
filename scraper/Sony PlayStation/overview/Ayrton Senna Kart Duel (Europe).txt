Ayrton Senna Kart Duel is a 3D kart racing game named after Ayrton Senna. Playable modes presented in the game include: "Race", "T.T", "VS", and "Beginner".  The Race mode is divided into three different classes: S Stock, SS Stock, and A Stock. Each class has three races. Before every race there are four different karts to choose from, each of them with its own characteristic (different acceleration, grip, maximum speed, and handling). The number of race laps can also be chosen: three, five, or ten.  The player must win every single race in order to advance in the game, and therefore be promoted. Finishing below the first position only drives the player to the Game Over screen.  After finishing successfully all the nine races, the player will receive the final challenge: racing against the greatest Ayrton Senna. If the player wins it, Senna will give the car he drove as a reward.  The game also features a Senna Memorial Data where it is possible to view some of the Senna's career records and photos.
