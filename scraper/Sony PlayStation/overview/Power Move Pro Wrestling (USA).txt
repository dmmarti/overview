In Power Move Pro Wrestling, you can choose from one of 11 fictional wrestlers to duke it out.  At your disposal is Agent Orange, Malibu Mike, and Chaingang, to name a few.

When in the ring, you have a wide array of moves to pull off, from body slams and piledrivers to head butts and shoulder breakers.

You can compete in various matches, such as 1-on-1, 2-on1, Royal Rumble, or King Of The Ring.

There are two main camera modes; one from ringside, the other from the second floor, giving you a higher view.  You can also rotate the ring 90 degrees, so you can see the action from any side.
