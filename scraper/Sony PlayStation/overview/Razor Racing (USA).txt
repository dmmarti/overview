The sequel to Razor Freestyle Scooter, Razor Racing has the same Tony Hawk-inspired gameplay but more of a focus on racing the small scooters carrying the Razor brand. The game includes 13 different characters to play and six areas in three cities. Each city has a track and a park. Once you successfully win the track race, you then have to beat a specified score in the freestyle park, which will then unlock the next city. Players can also collect token, to make available new characters.

By performing tricks and adding to the score, players can unlock new tricks and upgraded abilities such as better and increased speed. The multiplayer modes include Time Trial, Trick Parks, Freestyle Race and Circuit.
