Your Dad just got you an RC Helicopter. Play with it, or take it outside to complete various missions for friends and family. The missions range from cutting the grass in your backyard, to filming ghosts. With each mission, you earn points to upgrade your helicopter, (or even get new helicopters) and unlock more missions. Just be careful; your helicopter is somewhat fragile, and has a limited battery life.

RC Helicopter is a flight simulator of radio-controlled toy helicopters originally released as part of the Simple 1500 budget line in Japan. The helicopter is maneuvered with the analog sticks of the DualShock controller. The left stick controls the movement while the right stick makes the aircraft go up and down. A battery meter and a hit counter at the top right corner show the remaining energy left and the number of bumps that the helicopter can sustain. When the battery is drained or the machine received too many hits, the game is over and the mission has to be restarted.

The main objective is to complete all the missions available from the city map screen. At the beginning of each one, a character asks the player to perform a specific task with the helicopter. In some cases, the toy is equipped with special tools to complete the mission, like a squirt gun and a claw that can be activated by pressing the R1 shoulder button. In the first missions, the aircraft has to be used to transport soda cans to a garbage pail, cut grass with its blades, splash birds with the water gun, blow baseballs from a roof, recover document folders from train tracks and other challenges.

After completing a mission the characters give money as a reward, that can used to repair any damage to the helicopter and recharge its batteries. The mission money can also be spent on items from the RC shop. The player can purchase new helicopter models and upgrades, like a more resilient body for the machine, and more durable batteries.
