Atari's Red Baron game is a one-player game with an X-Y or vector-generator monitor. The game depicts a first-person's view from a World War I biplane cockpit. The player's goal is to destroy as many biplanes, blimps, tanks, pillboxes, pyramids and buildings as possible." "Players can maneuver their airplanes with the joystick control. Moving the joystick in its four directions creates a sensation of diving, climbing, or banking to the left or right."
