This driving game is very intense. Your perspective is somewhat overhead and behind the hood of the car. A very fast game. In fourth gear you are moving extremely fast and control is difficult, making for exciting and hectic manuevers. The oncoming traffic is always the same car composed of 3-dimensional "wireframe" vector graphics -- very impressive and ahead of their time -- similar to the enemy tanks in Battlezone. The stationary objects are not as impressive and usually crudely rendered.
