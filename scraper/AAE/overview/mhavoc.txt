You are Major Havoc, a clone and leader of a band of clones. "All from one, one from all, fighting for humanity..." Long ago, the Vaxxian Empire overran the galaxy and enslaved most of humanity. Only a few scientists escaped. While the Empire has largely decayed, their robot-controlled space stations still keep humanity enslaved. You need to set the reactors of these stations to destruct. This game is part space shooter and part platformer. You begin the game in your ship, fighting through a space stations defenses. In the first couple levels, these are just drones you must shoot out of your way. In later levels, this defense is a maze of energy walls. Spinning drones create the walls. You can shoot the drones to prevent them from completing some walls. After that, you travel up through the maze, the walls of which are deadly to the touch. You can shoot a wall out of your way, however, this requires lots of shots and you are constantly moving forward. You can only move left and right and fire. After you have breached the defenses, you must guide your ship left and right to successfully land on the stations landing pad. Next, the game becomes a platform game. Your fire button is now a jump button. Following the direction of the red arrows, make your way to the reactor and touch it. You now have a limited time to make your way back to your ship and escape. You have a shield that can get you past an enemy but there is only one per station.
