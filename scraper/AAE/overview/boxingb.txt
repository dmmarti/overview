This is kind of like a reverse of "Star Castle". In the center of the screen is a player-controlled rotating cannon, enclosed within an octagon. The cannon shoots fireballs from one end and has a boxing glove on an extension arm on the other end. The octagon is a protective wall for the cannon. Fireballs and the boxing glove pass over the wall to targets outside.Bombs are randomly located outside the wall. Each bomb has a lite fuse. Three bugs are also randomly scattered outside the wall. The player's score, the number of cannons remaining, and the number of bugs that must be knocked out to complete the round are shown at the top of the screen.
