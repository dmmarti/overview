Space Duel is a sequel to Asteroids and Asteroids Deluxe. Instead of shooting lumpy asteroids, you are shooting colorful geometric shapes and several new enemies. There is also a bonus round where you can earn extra points. The two player game has two styles to choose from. 'Competitive' allows you to shoot everything of the screen, including your opponent. It's all for one and that one is you. 'Team' in the same except your shots will not harm the other player. You are working together to destroy the enemy.
