There are five controls which need to be mastered, including a Tempest-like rotary knob for directing the course of the ship, a Phasers button which shoots limited range phasers, an Impulse button for forward motion at slow speed, a Photon Torpedo button that fires torpedoes capable of wiping out large portions of the galaxy and a Warp button that allows forward motion at super speed. The Photon Torpedo and Warp buttons are placed at an awkward position which may take some time to get used to. The game play involves a simulation of the powers and perils of piloting the Enterprise against The Klingon Empire. You have only one ship to command. If it is destroyed, the game is over. At the beginning of the game, you are given a certain number of shields and photons and during the game play, you can gain additional shields, photons, and warp power by docking with a Starbase. When your ship is hit, you lose a shield. If you run out of shields, the next hits will take out your photon torpedos, and next your warp power, and finally your ship, thus completing the simulation. There are six different enemies, including red, purple, and white Klingon ships, blue anti-matter saucers and the tricky yellow Nomad during special rounds, which plants dangerous space mines. The game has 40 different simulation levels, all of where you pilot the Enterprise and try your best to destroy all enemies to protect the Starbases throughout the galaxy.
