Black Widow is an arcade game where you control the titular spider trying to protect its web. You move the spider around the web with the left joystick, and use the right joystick to shoot in different directions. Your web is being attacked by other bugs. You must either shoot them or avoid them. Avoiding them means leaving them to the Bug Slayer, a creature that's harmless to you, but is invulnerable and competes with you. After it defeats a bug, you can go after its prey to steal its points.
