Volcano is a video game written by Michael St Aubyn and published by Acornsoft for the BBC Microcomputer.
Four men are stranded on the side of an erupting volcano and it's up to the player to rescue them with his emergency helicopter while avoiding or shooting the erupting boulders. The player has to work quickly since lava is pouring from the volcano down towards the stranded men. If a man dies he will turn into a ghost which will go after the player. Ghosts have to be avoided since they are indestructible. The player has three helicopters and gets an extra one after 5,000 points scored.
