Rally Pop is an Strategy game, where each character (they're cellphones, for some reason) has a base weapon and it's own strengths and weaknesses. You basically smack your foe with projectiles until they die, or destroy the platform they're standing on so they fall to their doom. Every once in a while a plane comes by to drop one of 8 or 9 other special weapons which you can use.</Notes
