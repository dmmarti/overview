Are you destined to survive, or fated to a watery grave?

In sixty minutes you'll find out. Meanwhile, you'll have to keep your head above water. Of course, with the ship capsizing, you may not know where "above" is. You may be tempted to save your own life, but saving others may have its rewards. Whatever you do, do it quickly, because time is the difference between life or death.
