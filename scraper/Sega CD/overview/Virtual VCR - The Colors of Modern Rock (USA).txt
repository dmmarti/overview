 The Colors of Modern Rock is a disc containing six music videos, published by Sega and Warner Custom Music, which can be played through the Sega Mega-CD, and was available through a special mail-in offer from Sega. It was developed by Digital Pictures as part of a planned series of titles called Virtual VCR, with the only other known announced title being Prince and The N.P.G.: Diamonds and Pearls, featuring videos from the album of the same name, which was featured at the Winter CES 1993, but was later cancelled presumably due to legal disputes between Prince and Warner Music during that time.
