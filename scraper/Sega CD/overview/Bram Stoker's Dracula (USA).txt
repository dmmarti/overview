 Loosely based on the 1992 film of the same name, players take the role of Jonathan Harker whose mission is to destroy "the horrible creature known as Dracula once and for all" by visiting many of the locations from the film and fighting the enemies located there.   This SegaCD game is a side-scrolling action title that makes use of digitized backgrounds (sometimes with interesting effects), digitized actors/objects, voice breifings before each level and full motion video cutscenes from the film.   The top of the screen is taken up by a stylish display showing the player's score, health bar and the health bar of the enemy boss of the level (should there be one). Players, controlling Jonathan Harker can move left and right on the screen, jump in the air, perform a high kick and rapidly punch. Using these skills, Jonathan must defeat all manner of enemies including bats, zombies, vampires, . Powerups can be found at various points, usually descending from the top of the screen. These include: an invulnerability powerup which also instantly kills enemies, a heath restore powerup.
