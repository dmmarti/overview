 AH-3 Thunderstrike is a helicopter sim/shooter. You will pilot the AH-3 over 10 operations all over the world. Each operation is composed of several missions, such as destroying tanks, or destroying bridges, or escorting trucks, and so on.  Thunderstrike's graphics consist of scaled sprites arranged to create a 3D environment. It makes use of the Sega CD's scaling and rotation hardware to create this effect with a smooth frame rate.
