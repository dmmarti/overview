 A virus has infected the world's computer network, which effects all electronical devices on the earth. However, a special program called "Panic!" is designed to counter the effects of the virus and restore the network back to working order. You play Slap the Boy and his sidekick, Stick the Dog(they're not actions, it's their names) who set out to restore the network back to working order.  This is not a conventional video game; it's more like an interactive movie/cartoon in which you press certain buttons to advance the plot, or make different stuff happen.
