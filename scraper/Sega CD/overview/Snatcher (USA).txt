 December 2042, Neo Kobe City, a city of madness and decadence...  Mankind is facing its gravest crisis. A mysterious bio-roid life form has appeared. Its true nature and purpose are unknown. Is it some country's secret weapon, or an alien from another world? They appear in the winter, killing people and taking their place in society. They wear artificial skin and can sweat and even bleed. They are called "Snatchers" because they "snatch" their victims before they take their place.  A new police force, specifically trained to fight the Snatchers, has been formed. They are JUNKERs (Judgement Uninfected Naked Kind and Execute Rangers). Every time you encounter someone, a difficult question must be asked â€” IS IT A PERSON OR A SNATCHER?  You are Gillian Seed, one of the JUNKERs. Your mission is largely adventure-based, with manga-style graphics and voice acting. Each room has objects to pick up, examine and use. Conversation with other characters is a key plot element. A few short shooting gallery type scenes add an action element. While the game is generally scary or comic, a few moments border on the sensual.
