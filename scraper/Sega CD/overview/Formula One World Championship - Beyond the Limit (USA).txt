 Beyond the Limit is a racing sim based on Formula One circa 1993. It features real-life cars, tracks, and drivers from the world of F1.  The graphics in Beyond the Limit are created from scaled and rotated sprites that create a 3D effect. It also features a lot of full-screen video clips taken from Fuji TV's coverage of actual races.  There are two main game modes: Grand Prix and 1993. Grand Prix mode is a points-based championship spread out over 16 races. 1993 mode lets you re-enact specific challenges in that year's races.
