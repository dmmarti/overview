 The year is 4001. The evil Luna has stolen a time machine and plans to use it to take over the world. You are the Time Gal, a skillful and pretty scientist, and your mission is to chase Luna through different time periods, to get the time machine back, and to save the world.  Created during the first age of "full motion" style, Time Gal is a conversion of an early arcade title. You watch animations of your heroine while she travels through levels, and overcome obstacles by pushing the correct button at the right moment. You can change directions, jump, shoot, etc., but everything is controlled during the never-ending fluent motion of the Time Gal. At certain points the heroine stops the time, and you have three choices to choose from.
