 Compton's Interactive Encyclopedia is a 1994 software program developed by The Learning Company for the Mega-CD; it was only released in North America, both as a stand-alone product and as a pack-in with the X'eye.  CIE is, of course, an multimedia encyclopedia licensed from the Compton's series of print encyclopedias, sporting a comparatively impressive 34,000 subjects, 5,000 pictures, and 30 video articles from the American Library Accociation. It is part of a sizeable series that presumably started in 1989 and had a number of entries throughout the '90s; a possible relation between this Mega-CD product and the similarly titled 1992 CD-i product is unknown.
