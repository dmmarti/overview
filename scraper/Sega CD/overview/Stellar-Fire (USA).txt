 The dreaded Draxon race has been at it again, pushing the human race around, working to either enslave all 10 billion humans or wipe them out completely. As the last surviving pilot sent on a mission to thwart the Draxons' plans, all hope rests on you. Invade each of the fortified moons orbiting the Draxons' homeworld of Arctaurus and then aim for the mother planet itself.  The action takes place in your hovermorph craft. In the game's introduction, the ship proves to be a deadly starfighter. When it enters the moon's atmosphere and approaches the surface, the hovermorph transforms into a powerful hovership. Blast away Draxon enemies, both ground- and air-based, from a first-person perspective on a 3D polygonal battlefield.
