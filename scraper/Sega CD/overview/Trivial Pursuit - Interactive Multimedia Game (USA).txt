 This is the first multimedia version of the classic Parker Brothers board game.  It uses photos, animations, videos and voice clips to pose over 2000 questions and answers to Trivial Pursuit questions.  In the Classic Game, up to 6 players roll an on-screen die and move their 'pie-dish' marker around the spoke-and-wheel game board, just like the board game.  The square you land on is color coded to one of six trivia categories:  People and Places, Sports and Leisure, History, Arts and Entertainment, Science and Nature, and Wild Card.  Answering the trivia question correctly lets you take another turn.  Further, if you are on the 'prize' square at the end of each spoke (1 spoke end for each category color), the correct answer grants you a colored pie piece in your pie-dish marker for that category.  Once you have all 6 pie pieces in your dish, you need to head back to the hub for a final random question to win the game.  In the Fast Game, up to 6 players can forgo the die-rolling and board movement.  It's a race to answer correctly a question from each category first!  Categories are randomly selected in this mode.
