 Sega Classics Arcade Collection is a collection for the Mega CD that includes five of Sega's biggest hits on the early life of the Mega Drive. These are Golden Axe, Streets of Rage, Columns, Super Monaco GP and The Revenge of Shinobi. While only taking a small part of the game CD, none of them was enhanced in any form.  It was never sold in stores, but remained a bundle title with both versions of the Mega CD.
