 This is a compilation of two strategy RPG titles from Shining Force titles:  Shining Force Gaiden (the original version released in Japan only), and its sequel, known outside of Japan as  Shining Force II: The Sword of Hajya, both for GameGear. In those games you control Nick, the Prince of Cypress. In the first game his task is to rescue Arni, the princess of Gardiana; in the second game, he has to conquer his kingdom back, that was captured by the evil empire of Iom. The re-release includes re-mastered graphics and higher quality music.
