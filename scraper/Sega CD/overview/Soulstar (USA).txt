 Soulstar for the Sega CD/Mega CD is a 3D shoot-'em up that combines several different types of gameplay into one game.  Some levels in this game are on a fixed path, similar to Space Harrier or Star Fox. Other levels allow your space craft to hover freely around a 3D environment, and in other levels your craft transforms into a walker robot for close-up attacks.  In Soulstar the player takes the role of a warrior pilot known as Bryk Hammelt.  It is your mission to prevent an alien aggressor known as the Myrkoids from draining the Soulstar system of its energy resources.
