 Wirehead has you controlling Ned Hubbard, a man with a wireless controller implanted in his brain, via your Genesis joypad.  The bad guys are chasing after Ned for his "mind implant", and of course, the only way to get it is to open his head. Reminiscent of Dragon's Lair, a path will open up, and you have to choose the right direction or Ned gets it.   The sets and locations are probably the largest scope ever for a FMV game, with real life chase sequences and stunts that take the player through areas like the Queen Mary, a saloon fight, an airplane, a water raft, multiple car chases, and even wrestling with a bear!
