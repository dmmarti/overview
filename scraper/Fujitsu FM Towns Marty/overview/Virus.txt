You've got the horrible virus. You may not have realized it, but you are seriously ill. Some of your organs have only been touched for 1, 2 or 3 years, and you will be able to heal them with your vaccine quite easily. But other organs have been affected much longer, sometimes 9 years, and it is really incurable. All you can do is fight relentlessly against viruses. But it is a fight all the more desperate as the oldest of them are the fastest and the most ferocious. Viruses gangrenent your cells which, in turn, generate new viruses, and these gather together to give birth to terrible Super-Virus that will jump on you and will devour you! Your chances are low, unfortunate!</Notes
