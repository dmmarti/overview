Especially repugnant, because the blue pyramid destroyed in a collision!  Mirrored Pyramid: how and blue are destroyed in a frontal collision.  That's just not try to shoot them!  Fireball it flies off at an angle, and reflected can kill you.  The steel pyramid that somewhere between concrete and purple pyramids.  In case of contact, they are heated, and after about 7 hits melted into the lava pit.  Keep in mind, they quickly cool down, so that would destroy not so simple.
