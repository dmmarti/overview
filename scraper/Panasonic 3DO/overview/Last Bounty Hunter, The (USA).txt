 The Last Bounty Hunter is a simple shooter in the tradition of American Laser Games's Mad Dog McCree. Fairly simple in design, it features a video background with which you interact - you use your mouse or a light gun to literally shoot your foes and protect the innocent.The story is this: you're a bounty hunter, one of the last, who come to a crime-infested Wild Western town to aid its Sheriff in getting rid of the criminals.
