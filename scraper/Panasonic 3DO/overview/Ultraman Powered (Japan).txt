 The player is cast as Ultraman, a Japanese masked super hero who has to fight the weirdest creatures that arrived from somewhere to destroy everything. Some of them looks like giant dinosaurs and the others are too odd to describe. This title is a one-on-one fighting game. The player has the option to fight in versus mode or story mode. Also, a two-player mode is included, to battle against human opponents.
