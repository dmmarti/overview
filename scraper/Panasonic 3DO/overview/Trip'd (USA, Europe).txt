 Trip'd is a falling block puzzle game similar to Puyo Puyo.  Instead of blocks, alien eggs of multiple colors fall down and the player must arrange them in a line of four of the same color in order to dispose of them.  However, if eggs of the same color are arranged into a square, they will hatch and form a giant alien that can instantly end the game for the player.  Players must complete the stage within a certain time limit or prevent the eggs to reach the top of the screen or else their game will end.  They also have the option to either play solo, against the computer or against a friend.
