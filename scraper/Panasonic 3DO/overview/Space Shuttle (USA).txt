 In Space Shuttle, the player can learn the history of the NASA's Space Shuttle program including the Enterprise, Discovery, Atlantis, Columbia, Challenger and the Endeavor.  Players can learn the history of them including the astronauts, their missions and the outcome of each mission.  Players can also train astronauts, launching them into space and watch them complete their mission and put their well earned training to good use.  The actually only gameplay consists of a first-person shooter where the player can get into a satellite and by using mounted lasers, blow away waves of space debris.
