 In Mazer, the player can choose from one of four soldiers tasked with freeing Earth from the oppressive rule of an alien race known as the Semag-Resal, who have a network of bases located all over Earth.  To make matters worse, they have developed cyborgs that can perfectly mimic human beings that can infiltrate their rebel hideouts and exterminate them.The gameplay is similar to Project Overkill in some respects with the view being isometric and the main goal of the game is to wipe out any alien life form within the bases and free human captives to receive bonuses.  As the player progresses, the enemies will become more numerous and harder to kill with the final boss of the game being a giant alien robot.
