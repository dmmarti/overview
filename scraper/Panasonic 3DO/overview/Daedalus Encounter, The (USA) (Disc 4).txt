 The interstellar war is over leaving you, a casualty, as a disembodied brain inside a life support system. Your buddies rescue you from the lab so that you can go exploring - scavenging the galaxy for wreckage and artifacts left over from the war. In due course you stumble literally into an alien craft. With your own craft disabled, and the alien ship on a collision course, you must explore it to find out what has gone wrong and to make a course correction. So that sets the scene and the scope of the game, it's an 'explore alien ship' adventure game.Gameplay consists of a lot of video sequences in which you talk to your colleagues, animated exploration sequences, and, static door opening and 'how do these alien controls work' type puzzles. There is also a maze and a bit of shooting, a timed sequence or two, most of the usual culprits. There's no inventory to speak of because being a brain in a box you have no pockets.All the action takes place in an in-game window that's your view of the world. It takes up only a small part of the screen and the rest of the screen is taken up with a kind of fleshy 'inside of your head' background that's there to remind you that you're inside a machine.
