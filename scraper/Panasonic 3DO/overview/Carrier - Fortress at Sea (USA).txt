 This title is one of many pieces of 3DO software that are in fact, not games at all. This title is a documentary piece about life on an aircraft carrier at sea in general, and specifically about the general workings of day to day activity on the aircraft carrier Carl Vinson while at sea in the Pacific. Included with the basic tour of the vessel, you get general ship statistics such as weight, size, speed, etc... Mission briefings and a very poorly executed game of landing the jet fighter on the deck of the ship
