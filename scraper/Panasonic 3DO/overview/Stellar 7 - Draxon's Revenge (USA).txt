The game puts you in the tank's cockpit as you traverse different alien landscapes shooting your weapons against all enemy forces you find in each level. Enemy tanks and turrets have the same firepower as you, so you must make use of the terrain and strafing tactics if you hope to survive.The game features enhanced, texture-mapped polygonal graphics as well as 2D sprites for specific objects, and also makes use of full CD sound and music, including fully narrated cutscenes.
