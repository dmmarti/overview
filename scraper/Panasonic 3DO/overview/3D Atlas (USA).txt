 Another one of those interesting educational pieces of software available for the Panasonic 3DO system, 3D Atlas (Electronic Arts, 1994) is not so much a game with the typical qualities to constitute a 'quality video game' in the traditional sense, rather it is an atlas-styled database of information regarding certain countries, cities, continents and so on. By selecting your criteria on what you wish to discover about certain regions of the world, you'll be able to find out some interesting information on the environmental, political and physical aspects of the location you are looking up in the game.
