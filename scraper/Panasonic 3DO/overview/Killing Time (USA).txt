 In the early 1930's, Tess Conway, obsessed with ancient Egypt, and her guests vanished without trace... right in the middle of a wild party on the Conway island estate. Sixty years after this events it's your mission to investigate the strange events that took place in those days.Though Killing Time is graphically a typical Doom clone, there are some differences: the game has one huge level instead of many smaller ones which allows you to return to old places at any time, i.e. to pick up health packs or ammunition. Also the spirits of Tess and her guests appear occasionally and bring the story of that evening to light helping you to find keys, to unlock doorways, to locate secret passages and to solve puzzles.Killing Time was originally developed for the 3DO, and was later converted to the PC.
