 Want to see some naked women? Then you are part of the target audience of this game. The premise: the NeuroNET features three NeuroDancers who are eager to remove their clothes for you. But like in real life they want to see credits for it. To earn these credits you have to hack the NeuroNET by solving a 3D maze. But when you achieved your goal the interactivity doesn't stop! No, you can use a virtual hand to click her shirt off even faster!
