 The game is a FMV-based shooter like Star Wars: Rebel Assault. There are first person levels where the player is limited to shooting the enemies with a somewhat awkward aim, but also stages played in a 3rd person view with obstacles to avoid. More than half of the game takes place in "cyberspace" which makes for some way-out looking graphics, in a 1990's sense. For what it is, Firewall is a fairly competent game, but the action grows unreasonably hard fast.
