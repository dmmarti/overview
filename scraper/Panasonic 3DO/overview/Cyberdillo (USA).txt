 Yet another disco armadillo first-person shooter. After being run over by a car, our hero Armadillo is brought back to life by an evil cyber-genetic company.  He sets out to stop their evil plans in psychedelic 70's era levels when disco was king.  Gather items such as bell bottoms, platform shoes, 8-track players, and lava lamps to keep your shield and funk levels up.  Rather than guns, you shoot plungers and throw princess wands at various enemies such as flying eye balls and laughing gas containers. Open doors as you move through each level (of 4 stages each) and find the specific item needed to advance to the next stage. Stop lights hang from the ceiling in certain areas and will drain your health if you pass under them when they are red.  When green, you can pass them with no consequence. There are different special weapons, health (such as crickets and grass hoppers) and shield items in each level. If you run into a Relax laxative box, you will have to find a toilet in 20 seconds or you will die.
