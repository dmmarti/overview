 This version of Fun 'N Games is a bit different from this version of the game. The paint, music, and style portion of this game are basically the same as the other version of the game, so the main difference is that there are a few more and different games in this version. The games included are:"Max and Maxine" is a Pac-Man  type game in which the player controls a mouse trying to collect all the cheese in the maze while avoiding getting hit by enemies. If the mouse eats a power up, it doubles in size and can now eat the enemies for a limited amount of time before it returns to normal size."Space Cadet" has the player shooting enemies from the cockpit of a spaceship."Aquashark" is a typical horizontal shoot-em up with the setting of the oceans of the future."Whereabouts" is the typical memory match game where the player flips over cards trying to match them to other flipped over cards. "Sliding Puzzle" lets the player choose a picture to get scrambled and it's up to the player to slide the tiles into the correct positions to get the picture complete again.
