 World Cup Golf takes the player to Puerto Rico's own Hyatt Dorado Beach Golf Course as they can choose from a bevy of fictional golfers or create their own in 18 rounds of golf.  There are 15 types of tournaments to choose from including skins, medal and stableford to name a few. Players can also practice their swing on the driving range.Players can also customize weather conditions as well as choose from a plethora of camera shots including the "Ball Cam" that follows the ball to its location.  Like many golf games, a meter is used to determine the accuracy and the power of the players swing and also features in-game commentary.
