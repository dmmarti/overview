 The action takes place in the old Old West town of Tucson, Arizona. The game's plot is based around gunfights with villains, much like that of its predecessors Mad Dog McCree, Mad Dog II: The Lost Gold and The Last Bounty Hunter.Like similar releases, it involves aiming a light gun correctly in order to eliminate successively appearing villains, simultaneously attempting to avoid hitting innocent civilians.
