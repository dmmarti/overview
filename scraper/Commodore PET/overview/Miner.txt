MINER! In this game you are a gold miner, facing the normal hazards of a deep mine: there are cave-ins, (which sometimes cause you to lose all your gold!), as well as underground springs that will flood your carefully dug tunnels. You move by using the numeric pad [2] is down, [4] is left, [6] right, [8] is up and [5] means "stop". Naturally, the first thing to do is get in the elevator and move down. When you get to the level where you want to work, press [4] and start digging with your pick. Gold (or hazards, such as springs or hard rock) will occur at the dots. When you find gold, get in the elevator and deposit it in the bank! You have a drill [D], explosives [E], and a pump [P] at your disposal. However, using these tools costs money! You'll win the game when you amass $10,000.

Miner! was published in Cursor Magazine #19 in April, 1980.
