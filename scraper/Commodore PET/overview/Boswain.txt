In Boswain the player has fallen through a trap door and is locked inside a room. A figure by the name of Boswain appears and offers to release the player at the cost of ten rubies as a tribute to Yakban. Boswain will take a ruby in one of his hands and the player must pick a hand. Every time the player selects the right hand he wins a ruby, but every time he picks the wrong hand the player loses a ruby, or when he doesn't have rubies anymore, a finger. The game is totally random.
