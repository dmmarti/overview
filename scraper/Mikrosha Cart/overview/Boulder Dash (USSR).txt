The ultimate underground journey, but be forewarned - nothing less than perfection is required! Boulder Dash will challenge your mind and reflexes like no other game. The objective is to search throughout each cave and collect as many jewels in as short a time as possible. Once the indicated amount has been collected, the door to the mysterious escape tunnel is revealed and you go to the next level. Boulders drop predictably enough, but you and Rockford also have to block growing amoebas, transform butterflies, outmaneuver fireflies, and overcome other numerous obstacles.</Notes
