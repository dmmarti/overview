The Way is a 2D cinematic platformer, inspired by games such as Another World and Flashback. The player takes control of Tom, a space explorer grieving over the death of his wife. Remembering strange writings about eternal life on a planet he explored, Tom sets out on an adventure towards the alien planet in search of a way to restore his wife back to life.

While The Way is primarily a platformer, it includes aspects from many genres, including stealth, puzzle, action, and even shooters. The gameplay consists of Tom exploring different areas and solving puzzles, while also battling enemies and avoiding traps. Tom starts out wielding a laser pistol, but eventually gains an alien sphere that can move objects telekinetically, shield him from projectiles, and even teleport him to an earlier location.
