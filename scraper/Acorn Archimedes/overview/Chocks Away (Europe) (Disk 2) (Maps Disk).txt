Chocks Away is a flight simulation game for the Acorn Archimedes. It was written by Andrew Hutchings and published by The Fourth Dimension. The game is loosely set in the First World War, though many elements are simplified and anachronistic. The player flies a single British Tiger Moth aircraft (despite the design dating from peacetime and being a trainer) on various missions against German forces. Free movement is allowed around each mission's map, though the aircraft does not have the fuel capacity to allow infinite roaming - instead it must return to the home airfield to refuel. The Tiger Moth carries a single fixed forward-firing machine gun with infinite ammunition. The player pilots the plane from an in-cockpit view, though a chase camera is used if they are shot down, showing the helpless demise of their aircraft.</Notes
