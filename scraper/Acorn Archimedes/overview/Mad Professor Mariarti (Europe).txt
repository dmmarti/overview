Professor Mariarti is, as the game title suggests, a mad scientist. Not all of his experiments worked out the way they should and now he needs to shut down the power in five of his labs (the first four can be tackled in any order). This plays out as a standard platformer: Mariarti jumps over gaps between platforms and dodges enemies (he can take a few hits before dying) until he reaches the end of the level, i.e. the off switch.
