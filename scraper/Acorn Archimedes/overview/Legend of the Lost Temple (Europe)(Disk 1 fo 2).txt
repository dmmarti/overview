The Legend of the Lost Temple is a platformer that takes place in the rain forest of Peru where an ancient tribe has lived in peace for thousands of year until a group of archaeologists stumbles upon it. The visitors carry a virus that the natives have no immunity to and soon everyone but the young and strong members of the community falls ill. The player takes control of one such young man, Kanu, who sets out to find a temple located deep within a mountain. It is believed that entombed in the temple is an elixir that can save the natives. It is the player's task to find this elixir.
