Jet Fighter is a variant of Jetpac that is largely the same as the original game but features a larger play area and different types of enemies. The player controls an astronaut that first has to collect all three parts of his rocket and then fully fuel it so that it can take off. The rocket parts are located on various platforms that the astronaut has to use his jetpack to reach. After the rocket has been fully assembled fuel will start falling from the sky and once enough of it has been collected the rocket will automatically ascend.
