Poizone is a Pengo variant with an ecological theme. The player controls the penguin Zozo as he attempts to decontaminate each of the game's 50 levels. Like in Pengo each level contains blocks that can be pushed or destroyed. It differs though in that the main objective is not to kill the enemies but to destroy a number of toxic blocks. To complete a level 90% of these blocks have to be destroyed and it has to happen before time runs out.
