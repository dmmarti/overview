StarFighter 3000 is a space combat simulation featuring air-to-air and air-to-ground combat with over 50 varied missions spread across 4 levels.  There are enemy fighters, heat seeking missiles and space cruisers to deal with, not to mention enemy SAM sites and radar installations.  The laser can be used to destroy defences by targeting the ground they are on.  By picking up crystals the player is able to upgrade his craft and obtain more ammo, and by combining colours, get more powerful weapons, some also obtainable from parachute drops sent by FedNet.  The player starts the game with three lives, and earns one every 250k points. Losing all lives means a game is over, but the game can be resumed freely from the last savegame.
