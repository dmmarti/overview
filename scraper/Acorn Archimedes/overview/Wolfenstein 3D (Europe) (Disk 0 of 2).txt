Wolfenstein 3D is a first-person shooter and sequel to Castle Wolfenstein.    There are six episodes and each episode has nine levels (eight regular and one final boss), plus a secret level activated by a hidden switch somewhere in the first eight levels. Regular levels often have the appearance of a maze or large areas with many enemies where the player must reach the exit elevator. To do this, he must kill the enemies and, depending on the level, activate "push walls" and / or obtain silver and gold keys to open certain doors.
