E-Type is a racing game similar to Outrun where the player gets to drive the titular sports car (although without the Jaguar license). The goal of the game is to drive as far as possible before time runs out. The game has five stages that differ in difficulty and length, from six to eighteen miles. Each stage has its own time limit. The tracks can be played separately or in one session. The stages are then unlocked by beating the time limit in the previous race. The roads are full of objects and most of them (rocks, trees and bushes) have to be avoided as crashes and collisions slow down the player. Exceptions are warning triangles which are worth points and suicidal boys who the player gets extra time for killing.</Notes
