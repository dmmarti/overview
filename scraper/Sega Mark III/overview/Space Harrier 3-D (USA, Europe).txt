Space Harrier 3-D is more like Space Harrier  1 1/2.  While it's not a direct sequel to Space Harrier, it was designed to take advantage of the 3-D glasses available at the time.  This game is considerably darker than the original and the sequel in both look and feel.  Even the digitized voices are deeper in tone, creating a sense of urgency about it.  Things are obviously not right in Space Harrier's world.  But if you're familiar with the original, the premise is the same; blow everything up and fight the boss at the end.
