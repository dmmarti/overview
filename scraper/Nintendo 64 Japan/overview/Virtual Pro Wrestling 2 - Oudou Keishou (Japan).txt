Virtual Pro Wrestling 2: Odo Keisho is a professional wrestling game. The game was only released in Japan and is the sequel to 1997's Virtual Pro Wrestling 64. The subtitle, Odo Keisho, translates to English as Royal Road Succession, which is also the name of the game's single player mode.  The game features the same engine as WWF WrestleMania 2000 but the two titles otherwise differ considerably and feature entirely different rosters. WrestleMania 2000 was released in Japan as well, unlike previous AKI-developed WCW titles.
