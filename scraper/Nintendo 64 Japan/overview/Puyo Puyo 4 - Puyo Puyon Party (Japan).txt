With the advent of the Puyo Puyo Circus, Arle and Carbuncle have come to visit and take part in festivities. Arle makes her way to one of the tents to watch a show, led by Satan as the ringmaster. As part of one of the acts, Satan requests a volunteer to come down to the stage. With Carbuncle as said volunteer, he performed a disappearing act, making him vanish before the crowd. After Arle leaves the tent after the show has concluded, she realizes Carbuncle is nowhere to be found. Thus, Arle begins to explore the circus grounds in search of her friend.
