In the 22nd century a special form of robotics known as Telerobotics allows robots to mimic human body movements, has become prevalent. Dr. Edward Maki Jr., a prominent scientist in the field, has brought new life to the sport of boxing using this technology. Robots that are remotely controlled by human controllers now duke it out in the ring. Similar to the boxing game Punch Out!!, the player ducks to the left and right avoiding blows from the robotic competitor, getting jabs in when they’re off guard. Each of the 8 or so opponents has a different weakness for the player to exploit. A special variety of “Machine Gun” charge attacks can be utilized to help the player make it up to the top of the Teleroboxer circuit.
