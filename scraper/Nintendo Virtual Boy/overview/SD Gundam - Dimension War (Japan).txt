SD Gundam: Dimension War brings together Gundams from every Gundam series, from Mobile Suit Gundam to Gundam Wing, to fight an equally diverse range of foes. Each mission in the game, which takes place after a text story segment, begins with both armies arranged on a square grid. The player can move their Gundams in close to attack, try to hit a target from long range, or hide in an attempt to ambush the enemy on their turn. If two units close to melee range then the game switches into a third-person action mode, which both units flying towards and away from the camera. Each unit has unique ranged and close range attacks, and is controlled by the player while fighting another MS, or controlled by the CPU when attacking capital ships.
