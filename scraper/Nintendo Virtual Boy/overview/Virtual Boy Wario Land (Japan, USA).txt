On a vacation in the Awazon river, Wario stumbles across a hidden cave filled with treasure. Of course, being Wario, he wants it all to himself. But the treasure is guarded and soon he finds himself deep within the Earth as the floor crumbles underneath his feet. Now Wario must find his way back to the surface, all the while collecting the treasure he believes rightly belongs to him.  This 3D style platform game, following the tradition of the Mario and Wario platform games of the Game Boy, will have you using Wario's unique abilities (butt stomping for one) to crash his way through the earth to the surface. His other abilities depend upon the hard hat he wears, and different ones are available that can come as an advantage.
