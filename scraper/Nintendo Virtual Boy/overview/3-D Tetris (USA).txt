A 3D Tetris game with a supply of three modes:  A. A three dimensional well appears, large enough to hold five layers of Tetris blocks. Every time you complete a layer with you falling blocks it will vanish and you will be rewarded by a hefty dose of points. If you ever stack over the five layers you will lose one of your layers, once all five are lost your game is over.  B. In this mode you place blocks around the center of the well, any blocks placed in the center will vanish, unless the block completes a layer in which case it will vanish.  C. In this mode a shape will be shown before the game begins. You will have to replicate this shape perfectly, even one block out of place and your game is over. Succeed and after a short animation a new shape will be given.
