Space Invaders: Virtual Collection features both Space Invaders and Space Invaders Part II along with a few frills. Both games are available in their original format, although Part II's multiple colors are lost seeing as how the Virtual Boy can't display any colors other than red. The two games are also available in a "3D" mode where the camera is tilted down 45°, although player and enemy movement remains unchanged. Finally two challenge modes are available for both games: Time attack, where the player is tasked with clearing a screen as fast as possible on a single life, and Score attack, where the player aims for the highest score possible on only three lives, with an extra life awarded every 1,500 points.
