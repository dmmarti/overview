This game is essentially a single-player sequel to Mario Bros. While the Super Mario Advance games would later contain a graphically-enhanced version of Mario Bros., Mario Clash contains many more additions and changes to gameplay.  As before, the goal is to clear a screen of enemies and move on to the next level. However, rather than doing this by flipping an enemy upside-down from underneath and kicking them away, you throw shells at them. Also, taking advantage of Virtual Boy's added depth, there is a front area and a back area which can be traveled to and from using pipes. Shells can also be thrown at enemies on the other depth area.
