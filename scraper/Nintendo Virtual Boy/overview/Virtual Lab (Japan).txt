Virtual Lab combines the falling blocks of Tetris with the linking pipes of Pipe Dream. After selecting the game speed a game field is generated with randomly placed and shaped worms. More randomly shaped worms drop from the top of the screen, and the goal is to link them together so that all open orifices are linked together or shut. If worms get linked together in such a way as to make it impossibly to close then off then a fairy will cut away all worms on the bottom of the screen. The game is over if any stack of worms reaches the top of the screen.
