Up for a game of tennis with Mario and his cohorts?  You get to choose from seven different characters, (Mario, Luigi, Princess Toadstool, Yoshi, Toad, Koopa Troopa, and Donkey Kong Jr.) all with different ability levels, to play against each other in either singles or doubles matches. You can also play in an exhibition or tournament mode.  In regular mode, you play against an opponent that you choose yourself for either one or three rounds.  In tournament mode, you get to play against three others in a tournament to see who is the greatest at tennis in a given game.
