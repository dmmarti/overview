Once a year, on Halloween, the portal between the World of Fairies and the human world is open, allowing the fairies to come and visit the children for one day. However, they must return home before the end of the day; otherwise they'll never be able to return to the World of Fairies again. It's up to you to get Jack back home before Halloween is over.  You start the game by choosing one of the three Jack Bros: Jack Frost, Lantern or Ripper. You then must make your way through six levels consisting of sixty floors of play. The core gameplay is very much like Namco's coin-op classic, The Tower of Druaga. Within the time limit, you must locate all the keys on a floor, which opens up the exit and allows you to venture to a lower floor. In your way are both obstacles and enemies, which you must avoid or take out if you are to reach the exit. On the lowest floor of each level is a boss enemy whom you must defeat if you are to get Jack home in time.
