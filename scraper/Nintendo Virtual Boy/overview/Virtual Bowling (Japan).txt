Virtual Bowling is a, of course, bowling game not too dissimilar from the only other bowling game on the Virtual Boy: Nester's Funky Bowling.  The game includes Standard Mode (10 frames of 10-pin bowling), Training Mode (The player can place pins where they want before taking a shot), and Tournament Mode (Four games of 10 frames each in which the player can move on only if they score higher than their competitors). Before a game the player can choose a name and make adjustments to the ball such as size or amount of wax applied. The player then chooses where to toss the ball, and sets the spin and strength with a sliding gauge.
