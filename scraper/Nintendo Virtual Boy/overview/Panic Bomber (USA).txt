Panic Bomber is a Tetris-style game set in the Bomberman universe.  The aim is to form a chain of 3 identical blocks to make them disappear. This causes bombs (not lit) to drop in your play field. These can only explode if you can place a lit bomb (which drops regularly from the top of the screen) close enough.  Doing well at this will fill your opponent's field with rubbish and make his life that much harder.
