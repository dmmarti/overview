Nester, once the mascot of Nintendo Power, and his sister Hester have decided to star in a bowling game As with every other bowling game in existence, you roll a ball down an alley in an attempt to knock down 10 pins. To do this in this game, you have to try and match up two gauges: Spin and Power. The Spin gauge determines how far left or right the ball will go, and the Power gauge determines how hard your character throws the ball.
