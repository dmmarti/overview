At its core, this is just another version of Tetris with its own set of graphics, sounds, and other quirks. Rotate blocks, and when you've formed a complete line they disappear. Mode A is the familiar endless mode of play, where you'll keep going until you've let the pile reach too high. Mode B is another common mode, where there are a set number of lines you must clear before victory is declared. Mode C is the most unique in this game. The game field is twice as wide, but you only use half of it at once; the other half is displayed further away in the background. You can scroll left or right at any time, creating new possibilities for creating lines and strategies.
