Bound is a platform and art video game featuring a dancer as main character. The game takes place inside the mind of a woman who is revisiting her childhood memories. In the game's world, the main character is a Princess who is following the orders of her mother, the Queen, to vanquish a monster that is destroying the world. According to the game's creative director, "everything in the game is a big metaphor", and there are scenes in the game that show real life and not the game's world.
