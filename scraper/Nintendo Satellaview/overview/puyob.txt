Puyo Puyo Tsuu BS Ban is a Downloadable game demo for the Satellaview. It is designed as a preview of the Super Famicom retail release Super Puyo Puyo Tsuu. As such, it is basically a smaller, more limited variant of that game.    In the demo, the mode of play is limited to to a VS. Match between Arle and Satan, which can be played either single player (with Player 1 as Arle) or a 2-player competition.
