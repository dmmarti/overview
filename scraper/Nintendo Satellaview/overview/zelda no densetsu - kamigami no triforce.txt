Zelda no Densetsu: Kamigami no Triforce is a view-limited Downloadable game for the Satellaview that was broadcast in at least 10 distinct runs between March 2, 1997 and May 29, 2000. Unlike BS Zelda and Inishie no Sekiban, Kamigami no Triforce did not use SoundLink narration or an enhanced orchestral score. Apart from its physical form and the addition of Satellaview headers to the code, the game is identical to the hardware version released for the Super Famicom on November 21, 1991.
