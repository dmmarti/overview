Paaman (or quite possibly Parman) is a comic in Japan which is done by Fujiko Fujio who did Doraemon. Like that wasn't already obvious just by looking at them. All of the four characters that you have the choice of controlling have the amazing ability to fly in an amazingly awkward fashion.  There's a side view, where you can fly, like what I was just talking about, and there's a top view, where you walk around inside of buildings and stuff. You can't fly though, but you can jump, which is pretty useless. What's cool about this game is the sheer amount of fun crazy bonus rooms you can go into and sometimes at the end of these rooms you can earn neat stuff, like new weapons or weapon upgrades.
