Great Deal combines a pack of cards and Tetris. You must dispose of a 52-card pack(with joker) into a 5x5 well. At the end of the round, you get a bonus if all cards are cleared, and you lose points for each card not cleared. You also get a bonus for stoppage time remaining. Pushing one button shuffles you between four cards, and pushing the other lets you eat up any part of the two minutes' grace period the game awards you per level. You can use it to make sure you drop something in the right place, or to get an idea of what to move next. It's an innovative concept among early Tetris games, trading time for points, and given the potential complexity of the game, it offers a fair amount of relief without spoon feeding the player. Great deal gives you points for 3 suits in a row, or any straight, or 3 of a kind in a row or on a diagonal. You get big points for 4   or 5.
