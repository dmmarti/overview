A girl in the year 2100 uses a robot suit. If the player is hit once, then the suit is lost and the player must play as the little girl. One more hit and the player loses a life. Although the game was only released in Japan for the Nintendo Famicom, the game's text is in English and is completely playable by English speakers. This game must be played through twice in order to see the true ending, just like in "Ghosts 'n Goblins".
