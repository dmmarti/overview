Exciting Boxing is a very unusual game in that it was sold packaged with a special controller. This controller was actually a plastic inflatable stand with the image of a boxer depicted in the front, and several sensors located on the inside. To play the game, players must inflate the stand, and literally punch the boxer on the front. The sensors inside would register the hits and transfer the information to the game, where the results of the player's punches would be shown on the screen.
