In "Bird Week", you control a mother bird, and your goal is to find food for your baby birds. The two babies are sitting on a branch, while you fly around and try to catch some butterflies or other things to feed your children. There are also hostile birds flying around, who try to kill you or take away your food. Once you have given your children enough food, you proceed to the next level.
