Blodia Land: Puzzle Quest is a colorful, active slide-puzzler with the emphasis more on fun than abstract brain-crunching. Each level has a twisting path, which vanishes as the little lost dragon-duck walks forward. If the player shuffles tiles wrong, the dragon spins and dies. Eight diverse SMB-style maze worlds with ten-plus levels each and mini-games in dead-ends make for one of the most colorful, expansive puzzle games the NES has to offer.
