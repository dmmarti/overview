In "Bloody Warriors", you play the role of a nameless young man from an ancient village, which suffers from attacks by a vicious monster. You are assigned to find the monster's lair and to defeat it. However, upon your return to the village you find out some people were abducted by the imperial troops. Now you have to find out the Empries's true motives and to solve a grand mystery.  The gameplay in "Bloody Warriors" is similar to  Dragon Quest series: you travel on the world map, fighting random monsters in turn-based, first-person-perspective battles, and visiting towns and dungeons. The major difference is the addition of strategy battles. At certain points you'll have to recruit knights and to fight whole armies of enemies.
