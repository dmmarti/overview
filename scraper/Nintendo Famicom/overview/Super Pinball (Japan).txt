Super Pinball is a NES pinball sim, providing six inter-connected tables for the player to explore and get high scores on. The overall goal of the game is to actually find and collect certain Mahjong pieces to complete a winning hand, but the Mahjong game itself has little to do with the actual gameplay besides providing a winning condition.    The game was published by Coconuts Japan, a company best known for publishing the Pachio-kun pachinko games. Pachio-kun himself makes a brief cameo on Super Pinball's title screen.
