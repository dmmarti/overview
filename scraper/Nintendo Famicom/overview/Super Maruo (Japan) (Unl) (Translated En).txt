Super Maruo is an unlicensed game released in Japan in 1986. Although very rare, this game is the first unlicensed Famicom game and the first unlicensed adult Famicom game as well. Despite the name, it has no relation to Mario at all. (with the exception of the main character being an edit of Mario from Super Mario Bros.).  The gameplay is very simple. You're a man and you have to go after the woman running around on the screen. At the same time, you have to avoid the dog that is chasing you around. After grabbing the woman, you are awarded a scene of her stripping or posing. Later, your character and the woman also begin to lose their clothes during gameplay. If you grab the woman for the second time, the game will display an erotic animation of the woman in sexual practices. After that, you have to repeat the whole process again. There are currently four erotic animations within the game.
