The game allows the player to control a shape-changing robot named R-10 (and his human controller Lance) as they fight evil robots. On the land, the player is a freight train that must follow the railroad tracks to the boss of the level. However, the robot turns into an airplane when the player is forced to fly to the next mission. Sea missions require the player to transform into a submarine.    The player has three lives and three continues as he struggles to liberate the world of Robocco from evil.
