In this casino game, you can choose one of two game modes: "game" and simulation. In the simulation mode, your character, a funny-looking egg-like creature, directly walks into a casino where he can exchange money for tokens and try his (its?) luck at the slot machines. In the "game mode", you are brought in a helicopter onto a top-down "world map" area. You are told that this is Brooklyn, New York, and begin to roam the area, gradually gaining access to different casino houses. There are also random encounters, during which you'll be able to bet some money and operate a slot machine directly from the world map.
