Just Breed is a hybrid of traditional console-style RPG like Dragon Warrior or Final Fantasy, and strategy RPG. During confrontations with the enemies, the battle screen occupies the entire location, and large parties of allies and enemies fight each other in turn-based style, moving on the field to perform physical attacks (melee as well as ranged) or to cast magic spells.
