Choujin Sentai Jetman is based on the Japanese TV show which resembles the Mighty Morphin Power Rangers.  The game was developed by Natsume and plays quite similar to their other title - Shatterhand. Itâ€™s a sidescrolling action game where the player has to shoot, kick, jump and duck to overcome a plethora of baddies. Before the player selects a stage, they have to select one of five heroes, each with their own amount of health and weapon type. They also have a limited use special attack that can clear the screen of enemies. At the end of each level the hero jumps inside a giant robot and engages in a one-on-one duel with the boss of that level.   The game features four difficulty levels (2 hidden),  a password system, and a "Battle mode" in which the player can practice fighting against any of the bosses.
