In a coup d'etat, a general deposes the king and it's up to a young hero, Alm, to join up with a rebel army and fight against this unjust rule.  Game takes place on battle maps in which the player moves all characters in his turn (or lets them assault/group via menu). If the characters enter close combat the display changes to a side view and the characters attacks the enemy once or multiple times (usually provoking a counter attack) for which the character receive experience points.
