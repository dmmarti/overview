It is the year 2061, and Halley's Comet is coming towards Earth. A crew has been gathered from eight different countries to man a pair of space probes sent to investigate the comet. The two probes, Comet and Corona, are to launch from Space Lab Jesus and collect a sample of the gases in the tail of the comet, and determine if life on Earth was brought by this comet as some have speculated. However, communication has been lost with the probe Comet; what could be going on?  Jesus is a Japanese-style adventure game. Each area is shown with an image, and you have the option of several commands. The player takes the role of Japanese pilot Hayao Musou, a member of the crew, and attempts to solve the mystery surrounding Comet and Halley's Comet.
