Aeons ago, two dragons and their follower were fighting each other. The  "Black Mages" worshipped the three-headed Chrome Dragon, and the "White Mages" worshipped the glimmering Gold Dragon. The wars fought for territory and ideals where endless. After ages of fighting, the god Narume put the Chrome Dragon to sleep in the mountains and the Gold Dragon to sleep in the desert, to stop the wars. Then he took th magic away from the mages, and sealed it in the 8 Magic Books, which he hid in the sacred desert tower. 
 
Hundreds of years later, three thieves stumbled upon the desert tower, and found the Magic Books. They split them up amongst themselves and every one of them, walked his own way. Now that the Magic Books were gone, the Chrome Dragon awoke from his slumber. Narume then infused the Gold Dragon with the spirit of justice, summoning him forth in the form of a hero named "Feram" 
Now it is up to him, to find the Magic Books and put the Chrome Dragon to sleep again.
