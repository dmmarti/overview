You play as a cherub on a mission to rescue his friends. Your point of view is from the side as you scroll the screen horizontally. You fly through the levels eating several different food items to keep your flight meter powered. You also have to dodge various enemies such as dogs,birds, and balloons. You can also shoot the dog type enemies with hearts from the cherub's Gau-Gau cannon.
