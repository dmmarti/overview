Silva Saga is notable for being a very Dragon Quest like game in the look of the game, but it does feel like a very different design philosophy. Minelvaton Saga, Silva Saga and Silva Saga II (Tthis third episode was on SNES) are all part of the same series.  Silva Saga is a game that would be boring to someone who doesn't like the Dragon Quest games on the NES.  After all, the game is basically Dragon Quest, with some easier mechanics and a different design philosophy.  If you do like the Dragon Quest games, however, you get less grinding, some pretty nice music, pleasant graphics, and a new world to explore.
