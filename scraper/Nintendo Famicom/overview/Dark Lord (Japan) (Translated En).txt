Dark Lord seems inspired by the Dragon Knight series, of which we got a random handful translated into English such as Legacy of the Wizard and Sorcerian. Dark Lord is really a lot like Sorcerian, it just swaps clunky action-based side-scrolling combat for clunky overhead-view RPGing with Shining Force-style battles.
