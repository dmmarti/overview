In "Columbus: Ougon no Yoake" you take control of young Columbus, who is dreaming to sail the seas and explore the world. You start at the age of 14, becoming a apprentice aboard an old ship, where you learn the basics of combat. Your ultimate goal in this role-playing-game is to discover the continent America, just like the original model Christoph Kolumbus. 
The Game can be played in two different modes. Either in "Normal Mode" or in "Historical Mode". The only difference of the historical mode compared to the normal mode, is that you have a limited ammount of time to complete the game. You start in December of 1465 and the game then ends by the end of 1492. The time ticks off, based on the number of steps you take, what means that you'll want to keep your steps as low as possible. 
Discover the new world and take your place in history!
