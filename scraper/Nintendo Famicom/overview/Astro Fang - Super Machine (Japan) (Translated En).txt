Somewhere in the galaxy lies the planet RS-121 – a desolate planet that has suffered terrible disasters which made life impossible. Only one construction still remains on the planet – a highway called Black Line. It is said than an ancient legend is somehow connected to this highway. You, a man named Riber, decide to participate in a racing competition on the Black Line. But be ready – the competition can bring deadly results...  In this racing game, you drive your car on the highway through pseudo-3D environments. The opponents will not hesitate to push you outside the road. You can either squeeze between them (pressing the Down button will make your car smaller), or shoot at them with a limited amount of missiles. On the way there will be shops where you'll be able to repair and upgrade your car.
