JaJaMaru no Daibouken is a Family Computer video game that was released exclusively for a Japanese market in 1986.    The concept of the game is that the player controls a red ninja as he progress through a series of Japanesque levels defeating evil spirits that have spread across the land. The player can even ride his faithful frog if he can recover it from hiding.
