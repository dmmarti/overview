Bonk has his revenge on King Drool III in his second game for the TurboGrafx.  It's not exactly clear why Bonk is so vengeful, but it appears that King Drool is responsible.  Bonk uses his over-sized cranium as a lethal weapon in this sequel.

The gameplay in this adventure is very similar to the first game.  Bonk has  head-butting, head-stomping, and fire-breathing moves when he eats some spicy meat.
