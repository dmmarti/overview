Very similar to the famous  Zelda games, "Neutopia" is Turbo Grafx' answer to Nintendo's king of action adventures. You roam freely the vast land, fighting many different monsters in wilderness areas as well as in dungeons. Dungeons also require some puzzle-solving (pushing stones, blowing walls with bombs, etc.). The game has a slight RPG flavor, allowing you to power-up by collecting various items, and equip different weapons and armor.
