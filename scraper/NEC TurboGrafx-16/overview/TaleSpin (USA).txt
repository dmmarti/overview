Tagame, based on the early-90's animated series of the same name, allows you to play as Baloo, star of Disney's Jungle Book movie and ace cargo plane pilot.

At the start of the game, Baloo's old friend Louie tells him of a stone artifact that points the way to a treasure in the clouds.  Unfortunately the artifact has been broken into 4 pieces spread out over the island. Baloo must make his way through 4 levels to recover them.  Along the way Baloo will be challenged by familiar enemies from the TV show.

Most of this game is side-scrolling action. Between levels, you get to play a sky-surfing bonus game played from a top-down perspective.  There is also a short side-scrolling shooter level near the end of the game.
