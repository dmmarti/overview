Sonic Spike is a beach volleyball game. The player takes the role of a volleyball team with two athletes (which have different strengths and disadvantages) and tries to win a tournament. The second athlete can also be played by a second human player. The controls offer no surprises: players move an athlete over the field and use two buttons for jumping and hitting. Single players also have to switch between the two athletes.  However, each athlete has a n energy value which decreases over the course of a match. By using a water bottle the energy gets filled up again, but there is only a limited amount available. When using the training mode instead of the tournament, players can choose between one of three fields and an easy mode which is basically a slow motion mode.
