The peaceful village of Anoraff is threatened by the evil Orb Gamut, who terrorizes the villagers with his army of undead. Someone has to travel to his manor and destroy the overlord, a job falling to young Arthur.  Ghost Manor is a horror-themed platform game in which players control Arthur on his quest for the manor. It consists of several large levels, including the road to the manor and various rooms inside, including hallways, storerooms and cellars. To move on to the next stage, Arthur usually has to find a key that opens the exit door. This might be hidden in some corner or only appear once a certain monster is defeated. To defeat enemies, Arthur uses a magic orb that fires projectiles. Ammunition is limited but can be restored through a power-up. Arthur can also find stars which increase the shot power, hearts that restore lost health, extra lives, and various special items used to tackle obstacles in his way. Not all enemies are harmful: some can be utilized to carry Arthur around the level or catapult him to a place he can't otherwise reach.
