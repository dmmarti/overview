As a member of N.I.C.E. (Nations for International Citizens of Earth), Keith Courage takes up the fight against the aliens of B.A.D. (Bad Alien Dudes) through seven levels in this side-scrolling action platformer.

As Keith Courage makes his way through the various zones, he attacks various forms of enemies in order to gain coins.  The coins can be used in the shops for various power-ups, equipment, and other helpful items.

When he makes it to a certain point in each level, Keith Courage is given access to the Nova Suit, an armored suit with a powerful sword that is used to dispatch the end bosses of each level in the Underworld.  Once Keith Courage defeats the boss, the returns to the Overworld sans armor to complete the next set of challenges.
