Samurai Ghost is the sequel to the Japan-only Genpei Toma Den. You start the game as the undead ronin Kagekiyo, who sets out on a quest for revenge to defeat the demons and mystical monsters that haunt the Japanese countryside.

The game is an action side-scroller, in which you control Kagekiyo as he scrolls through several stages slashing all the enemies that cross his path. Your ghostly nature also grants you energy-based attacks and several supernatural abilities which are mostly used to take you to surreal stages in which you can levitate and walk on water.
