 Makai Prince Dorabocchan is a platformer in which the player takes control over the son of a mighty vampire. Unfortunately he opens a seal which causes monsters to come into the world. Now he needs to cross six levels (each with a boss) while avoiding to lose all life energy. The levels are side-scrolling with horizontal movement involved. Besides dodging by jumping, the player character has two standard ways to deal with enemies: using the unlimited vampire breath (works like a gun) or using tomatoes as bombs which have to be found first. The enemies leave behind various power-ups when killed, e.g. energy, extra lives or armor.
