 F1 Circus '92 - The Speed of Sound takes you through a year in the World Championship, on all the courses with all the teams (remember when Hakkinnen and Shumacher were yet-to-be superstars and Damon Hill or Nigel Mansell were the kings?....this game does!). You'll start by trying to qualify in each race, beating a certain time and gaining a 1/2/3 race finish. As you race further on and beat each track, you will begin to amass points and challenge for the lead in the World Championship.
