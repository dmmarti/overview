 While screenshots may make this look like a straightforward platformer, it’s actually a little different. It is (for most levels) an auto scroll platform shooting game, where you are constantly running, dodging and building up different ‘powers’ accessed by holding down the fire button. These range from whirlwinds to multiple genies and can get quite destructive when fully powered.
