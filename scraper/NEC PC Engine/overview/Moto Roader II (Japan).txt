 Moto Roader II is a racing game shown in a top-down perspective. Five vehicles compete on a course with the goal to finish first. However, the screen always follows the leading vehicle and if a vehicle is left behind, it gets replaced on the current screen. Every vehicle has a fuel counter which gets a penalty if the vehicle is hit or needs to be replaced. Reaching zero ends the race. Players can choose between three vehicles which drive differently (car, tank or hovercraft) and, if they have gathered enough prize money, can upgrade it between races (including weapons). In contrast to the predecessor, the game has a futuristic look.
