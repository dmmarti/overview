One day, Hani (sometimes known as Honey), who is a phallic objet d'art from stoneage Japan, is summoned by the god Izanaki. Izanaki is worried because his wife Izanami's heart has been invaded by a demon. His once peaceful wife now kills thousands of humans each day and threatens to destroy the world that she once created together with her husband. Hani must fly into Izanami's heart and destroy the demon.

Once Hani has entered Izanami's heart, and you are put in control, it turns into a vertically-scrolling shoot'em up. One button fire the gun, but the other one rotates the gun clockwise, so that you may shoot at enemies coming from any direction. Hani is thus reminiscent of a flying tank. Hani starts out with only one life to spare and a weak weapon, usually giving few minutes of play before game over. However, each enemy shot gives spiritual power to Hani. Pressing the run button puts you in contact with Izanaki, who will let you trade in those power points in exchange for the usual assortment of power-ups, such as multiple shots. Izanaki will also grant you teleportation abilities, so that you may travel back and forth between levels.
