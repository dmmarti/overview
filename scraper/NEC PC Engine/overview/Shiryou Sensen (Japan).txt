 Due to mysterious circumstances, a flourishing city called Chany's Hill was cut off the rest of the world. Investigators found out that most of the buildings were destroyed, horrifying creatures are roaming the wilderness, and the few survivors have no means of escaping. The SSWAT (Supernatural Special Weapon Attack Team) sends an agent named Laila to the city. The young woman has powerful psychic abilities, which can enhance her firearms, helping her deal with the monsters. She must rescue the survivors and escort them to safety, at any cost...****Shiryo Sensen - War of the Dead is an action role-playing game. The player navigates Laila over the top-down "world map" (the ruined city has basically turned into large wilderness areas with a few buildings that are equivalent to "dungeons" in other RPGs), fighting randomly appearing enemies. The battles take place on separate side-scrolling screens, and are fully action-based. Laila can jump, duck, and attack with melee or ranged weapons. Typically there are several enemies on the screen; Laila escapes the battle if she reaches the end of the short side-scrolling area.****Enemies leave orbs of various colors and chests upon defeat; these serve to heal Laila, grant her experience points, "mind points", or ammunition for the firearms. Laila starts with a knife and a pistol, but later gains access to more powerful firearms. These weapons can be enhanced with Laila's psychic techniques, which, in their turn, require mind points.
