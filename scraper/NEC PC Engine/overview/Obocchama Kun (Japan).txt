 Obocchama-kun is an action game based on the TV anime of the same name (which itself is based on a manga). Winning the game is basically achieved by getting to the end of each level and beating the boss (sometimes replaced by another special challenge). Of course there are also a variety of enemies (two different per level) running around which try to harm the protagonist. He has two weapons to use against them: either shooting them or, well, jumping in their face with his buttocks. There are also power ups to collect, e.g. weapon upgrades or summoning an ally which supports him through the rest of the stage. The protagonist also has the ability to transform himself, e.g. into a dog or a blind man.
