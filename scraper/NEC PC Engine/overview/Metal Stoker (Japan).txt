 Metal Stoker is a 2D top-down, multi-directional shooter. The player controls a female pilot (presented only in several cut-scenes) controlling a prototype CS-05 tank. The tank can freely be moved around the screen in any direction and the game scrolls along until the edge of the area is reached. The tank needs to destroy enemies and locate the exit. There are several weapons such as lasers, homing missiles, mines, a force field etc. The tank's turret can be locked into one position to shoot, so it is possible to strafe. Sometimes the player must destroy all the enemies or a boss to progress. The game has seven levels in totals and many parts of the levels are mazes.
