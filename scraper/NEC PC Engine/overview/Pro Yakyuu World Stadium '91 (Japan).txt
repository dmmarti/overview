 Pro Yakyuu World Stadium '91 is a baseball game released for the PC-Engine. The general gameplay as well as the graphics style closely resembles that of Namco's own "Family Stadium/Famista" baseball series for the Nintendo NES/Famicom. Game options include a one or two-player mode as well as watching two computer opponents play against each other. Players can choose from one of ten non-licensed teams.
