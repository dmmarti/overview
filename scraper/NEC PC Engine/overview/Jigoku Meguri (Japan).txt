 Emma, king of the underworld, has gone crazy and brought his domain into chaos. Your mission, as Bonze Kackremboh, is to get rid of the evil spirit from Emma and annihilate his followers such as snakes, giant eyeballs, ghosts, and other enemy creatures. His only weapons are bubbles of various colors that can be powered up until they become almost as large as Bonze himself. He can also use these bubbles as special attacks, but once he uses it, the bubbles decrease in size and he must get some items that are the same color as the bubble to increase its size. Occasionally, an angel will appear who will give Bonze other items that will help him in his quest.
