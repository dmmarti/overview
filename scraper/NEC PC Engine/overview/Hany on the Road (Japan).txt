Following on from Hany in the Sky (released the year before), Hany on the Road is a scrolling action game and bears a strong resemblance to Shockway Rider, a game released a few years before on the Spectrum, C64 and Amstrad CPC. You control Hany (or Lemon if you are playing a two player game) who must run the length of the 'road' to reach the goal. The road is divided up into four walkways, which you can instantly switch to by pushing up and down on the pad. Depending on the stage, the walkways have various behaviours: some auto scroll, with the faster at the bottom of the screen, others are push-scroll and some even scroll in multiple directions just to shake things up. They are also littered with enemies and obstacles, such as the fiery rocks that rain down from a volcano in the background.  Unfortunately for Hany and friend, he's not blessed with a weapon of any kind, so to protect yourself you have to rely on dodging and jumping to stay alive. There are also plenty of items to collect that give anything from points to lives and some that clear the screen of enemies if you can get to them in time. Once the level is complete, you are on to the next one and are sometimes given a choice of which route to take.
