 Although it looks like the PC Engine (TurboGrafx) version of Momotaro Densetsu for NES, it is still a different game, with different map layout, events, etc. The story follows the classical Momotarou plot: an old couple found a boy inside a giant peach, and named him "Momotarou" (peach boy). Later, the boy decided to rid the land of the evil demon tribe. Help Momotarou to reach the Demon Island and to defeat the demons!****Gameplay-wise and graphically, this is a typical Momotarou RPG: navigating the little hero through the rop-down world map, you visit towns, descend into dungeons, equip Momotarou with weapons and armor, buy items, and fight random enemies and monsters in turn-based combat viewed from first person perspective.
