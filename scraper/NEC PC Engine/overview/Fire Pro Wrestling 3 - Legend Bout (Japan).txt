 Fire Pro Wrestling 3: Legend Bout is the third game in the long-running Fire Pro Wrestling series. The game is very similar to the first two. There is a significant increase in the amount of wrestlers, however, and there are a few new modes, such as wrestler editing mode and "hidden mode". There are 28 regular wrestlers, and 4 hidden wrestlers. As usual, while fictitious, they are based on real wrestlers, such as Hulk Hogan. This was the last of the series for the PC Engine as a stand-alone console, with one more being released for its Arcade CD-ROMÂ² add-on.
