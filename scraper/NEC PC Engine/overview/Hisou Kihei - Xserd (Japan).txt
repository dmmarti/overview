 Hisou Kihei X-Serd ("Flying Mounted Cavalry X-Serd") is a strategy game where the majority of the units are mecha, or robot suits. The game was exclusive to the PC Engine and was released soon after another mecha strategy game from Masaya: Gaiflame.  In each scenario, the Serds - a league of specialized attack mecha - are deployed from their HQ ship Altea. The Serds all have single-letter code-names and different specializations: for example, the G-Serd wields a laser sword for devastating melee attacks and can move quickly, while the B-Serd is capable of long-range mortar attacks but has limited movement. The eponymous X-Serd is the most powerful of the team.
