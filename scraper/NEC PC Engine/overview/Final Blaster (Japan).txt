 Final Blaster is a vertically scrolling shooter with seven levels. As usual, the player mans a space ship, has to kill the enemy opposition and a powerful boss enemy at the end of each level. A speciality is the dynamic difficulty: if the player offers a good performance in a level, he gets ranked up which affects the difficulty of the next. There are four of those ranks. The game features two power ups which are represented with different colours: weapon upgrades and drones which accompany the player. Those can be upgraded twice each and are compatible to each other. If the player dies, the extras are evacuated into a green capsule. It can be then picked up when using the next life.
