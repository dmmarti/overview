 In this platformer, loosely based on the classic Chinese novel Xi You Ji, players take control of Son Goku who has to rescue his friends from a mysterious villain. In seven levels, Son Goku has to survive various jumping puzzles, fight off enemies with his staff and collect money in form of fruit. Along the way, he can pick up various helpful items that can either be bought in stores or found hidden within the levels. They include: Medicine that refills Son Goku's health, a magic lamp that allows him to continue after losing a life, keys that open doors, a glove that breaks certain walls and a cloud that Son Goku can use to fly during boss-battles. Additionally, Son Goku can buy longer and more powerful staffs if he finds somebody who sells them.
