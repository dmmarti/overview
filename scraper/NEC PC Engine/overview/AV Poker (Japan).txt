 AV Poker is a simple strip poker game, different in many aspects from another title with the same name. There are no actual opponents: the player bets certain amounts of money (up to the allowed limit), is then dealt a five-card hand, and given the option to hold any of the cards and deal the rest again. Anything less than two pairs is an automatic loss; the monetary value of other combinations is always pre-set. A "special" mode takes the player to various casinos in the world (starting with Japan). Winning enough money leads to erotic scenes featuring undressing women drawn in realistic (non-anime) style.
