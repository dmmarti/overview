 The royal family of Bunnyland was kidnapped by monsters and the player has to save them by beating all six levels of this side-scrolling shooter. The reason why the protagonist, a rabbit, can fly is the rocket launcher on his back. Just like in most shooters, the main objective is to survive the way to the end boss of each level without getting hit by enemies (three hits result in a life loss). The rabbit has three ways to defend itself: a regular gun, a strong melee punch and limited homing missiles. The power ups are shield energy refreshments, extra points, invincibility, more missiles and missile upgrades.
