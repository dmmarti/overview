 This is an enhanced version of 1942: The Pacific Air War, with most of the graphics and sounds reworked. There are also changes in the weapons and the inclusion of anachronical items such as laser-firing WWII planes and ships that run on ground. The player controls a biplane Boeing Stearman E75 N68828 instead of the P-38.****The PC Engine adaptation adds some original levels to those from the arcade version, as well as animated intermissions.
