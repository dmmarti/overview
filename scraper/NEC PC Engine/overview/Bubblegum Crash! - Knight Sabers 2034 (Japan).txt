 This is an adventure game based on the sequel to the superb classic cyberpunk anime Bubblegum Crisis. It puts you in the shoes of Nene from the Knight Sabers, a group of women in power suits out to sort out the problems that the AD Police canâ€™t handle. Be aware that unless you can read Japanese, there may be a certain amount of trial and error involved before you get anywhere.
