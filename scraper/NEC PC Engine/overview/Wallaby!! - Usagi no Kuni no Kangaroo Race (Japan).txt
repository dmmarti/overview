 In this game the player bets on races. The twist is, the racers are wallabies. They also have rabbits in their pouches. The game takes place in a world largely inhabited by the said rabbits, but there are other animals, such as koalas who serve as bookmakers. The game also features managerial elements, as the players must manage their racers. The player can choose to play as one of four rabbits and name them. The racing itself is non-interactive, the only option being to change focus from one wallaby to another. The player can watch a race whether they've made a bet or not.
