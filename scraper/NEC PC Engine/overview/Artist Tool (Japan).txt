 A unique piece of software for the PC Engine, Artist Tool is a graphics program that allows you to draw and print your own artwork when combined with the 'Illust Booster', 'Print Booster' and 'Photo Reader'. The interface has a rudimentary set of tools to choose from, like freehand, straight line and circle, and also a few tunes to listen to while you draw.
