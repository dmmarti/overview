 Popular children's character Chibi Maruko-chan makes her way onto the PC Engine with this cleverly presented action/quiz game. Choose your difficulty and set off down the street...but beware as there are birds, cats and nasty robots intent on zapping you. You have as defense your explorer's helmet, and magical stars shoot out of it to dispatch the baddies (jumping on their heads for a quick escape is also an option if you need to). While all this is going on, you are presented with a series of questions at the top of the screen. You have a choice of answers from A-D and to make a selection you have to pick up the corresponding letter from a defeated enemy. Get three wrong and you're out.
