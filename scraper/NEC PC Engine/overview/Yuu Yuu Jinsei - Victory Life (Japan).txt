 Yū Yū Jinsei: Victory Life is a video game adaption of the board game "The Game of Life" for up to five players, either controlled by human or computer players. Players are displayed as little cars driving on a road track, symbolizing a whole life from birth to death. Each turn players have to spin a wheel, determining the number of fields the player advances on the "board", which will almost always result in an event. Events can either be positive or negative, mostly influencing your account balance. In the course of the game, players will take on a profession, marry and might get children. The game ends when every player reaches the retirement phase. The player who is wealthiest by then wins the game.
