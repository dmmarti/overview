 The youngest child of a mysteriously disappeared family didn't join the family on a journey to a far and unknown place to board an odd ark because she had to keep on cultivating their land. An humble peasant spread the word: a creature coming from the underworld took away the ark!****The girl must have been touched by the hand of luck... and she alone is the only one who can save and take them safely back home.****You can move around in eight directions, trying to defend yourself against the attacks of creatures coming from the underworld.**You can defend yourself by means of scrolls with obscure magician runes, throwing cards and other weapons to be picked up en route.****The magic cards and magic spells have a limited range or last only for a short period of time but can be powered up by collecting the runes found after destroying a formation of red flames-shaped enemies or waving an black and white flag.**Several items (mostly pearls) will be found along the way and can be picked up and used to defeat the enemy creatures.****A round consist of multiple scenes (areas) and each scene is completed when the Scene Guard has been defeated and when a round is completed one family member will be free and return safely home...
