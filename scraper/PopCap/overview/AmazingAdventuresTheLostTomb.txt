 In Amazing Adventures: The Lost Tomb, you're a historian who received a piece of map sent by the museum you're working for. It is believed that it's belonging to a bigger map revealing the location of The Lost Tomb. It's up to you to gather information and to find the place for collecting the treasure in it.  The main mechanics is a list of objects you have to find in a limited amount of time. When you spot one, click on it for deleting it from the list. Sometimes, you have to find more than one object (for example: 2 wrenches) or items described by a riddle (like "ivory owner" for elephant). This hidden object game contains also mini-games, like spot the differences or puzzles. Also, if you find the 21 scarabs, one hidden per level, you'll unlock a second game mode.
