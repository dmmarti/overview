 Typer Shark is a computer game in which the player must type the words on various sharks and piranha to avoid being eaten while he/she dives to the bottom of each level. Typer Shark also contains a typing tutor mode to increase typing abilities, along with a statistics page so that the user can track their performance and see how they improve over time. The main adventure game mode has branching paths that allow players to choose various challenges, from toxic sharks with mutating letters, to stealth hammerhead sharks where the word remains invisible for a period of time. Over time, the player's "Shark Zapper" builds up and can be used to instantly destroy an entire wave of enemies. Every few levels a boss battle occurs, in which the player must type the words on the projectiles to send them flying back at the enemy.  Abyss mode is an endless mode in which the player continuously dives deeper and the waves of sharks become more challenging. Every few hundred feet a boss battle occurs.
