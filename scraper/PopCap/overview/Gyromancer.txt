 Gyromancer is a single-player puzzle/RPG hybrid. You traverse each 2D level carrying 3 beasts with you, each with different powers. Meet a foe inside the map and you must choose one of the beasts to fight for you. The fight mechanics are very much like Bejeweled Twist: you can rotate any 2x2 square inside a 8x8 grid with gems of many different colors; match 3 gems and your beast powers energize. Once a power is fully ready, a random gem lights up inside the board. Match it and an attack (or some other effect) is unleashed upon your enemy. Chaining up matches make your energy rise faster, while failing to make a match makes your foe's energy rise quickly. Kill your enemy and you gain experience points to level up your beasts; if your beast reaches 0HP, it will have to sit out of battles for the remainder of the level.  Inside the levels, you may find chests with money and items to be used during the fights, or "codes" which allow you to summon more powerful beasts (as long as you can pay for them).
