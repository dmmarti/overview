 Alice Greenfingers is a light sim garden growing game. You start the game on an empty field with just a shovel and a bag of tomatoe seeds. Your goal is to dig up the field, plant seeds, water them and watch them grow. When they are ripe, you harvest them and bring them to the market where you sell them.  During the game you get access to more crops and other items that will help you create your garden. Various events also happen from time to time. You can for example inherit money from a distant relative, or get an offer to buy a book. These event affect the various meters in the game, such as wealth and knowledge.  The goal of the game is to max out your stat meters and money, but many people play just to create a beautiful garden. After 30 "days" the game ends and your achievement is rated, ranging from F to A+.  A thing that makes this game stand out from other simulation games is the fact that practically everything you do is performed by Alice herself in real time, rather than controlling the game from a "god perspective" kind of view.
