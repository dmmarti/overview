 Bejeweled Blitz is a free to play Bejeweled game that can be played on the PopCap website or on Facebook.  The game plays similar to normal Bejeweled but with a strict time trial of 60 seconds. The player swaps gems to line up three or more of a kind. When successful the gems are removed from the game and gems fall downwards with new gems filling up the playing field at the top. Various special gems can supply score multipliers or destroy all gems in a row, column or of a specific color.  The player can collect coins (special yellow gems) to buy power-ups. Power-ups give the player special options or more time and last for three games before they expire. The player can only have 3 power-ups at the same time.  The aim of Blitz is to gain the highest score. Scores are compared with Facebook friends that also have the game installed. Scores are reset every week. There is also a cooperative element involved as the player gains a team score based on the combined score of all friends playing the game. This score gives the player a shot in the weekly tournaments with real prizes.  The Blitz game mode is also included in Bejeweled 2 for the iPhone. Players from all platforms compete in the same tournament.
