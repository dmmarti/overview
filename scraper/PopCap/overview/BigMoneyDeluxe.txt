 In this puzzle game, you need to collect money bags. In the Action and Strategy mode, you need to remove coins from the screen by selecting groups of 3 or more adjacent coins of the same colour. As they disappear from the screen, you earn points and the money meter will rise. If the meter is filled, a money bag appears. Acquiring a set number of money bags brings you to the next level. As you play, new coins will be minted at the bottom of the screen continually. At times, a special dollar bomb appears that destroys all coins of one colour. The strategy mode allows you to play at your own pace.  In the Puzzle mode, you have to plan your moves to clear the entire screen. Your moves do not cause new rows to appear.
