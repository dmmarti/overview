 Mahjong Escape: Ancient China is a Mahjongg variant set against a background of Ancient China. In the Dynasty Adventure mode, players travel through the history of China's dynasties, from 2000 BC to 1912 AD. In the second, Classic game mode, any of the 125 available layouts can be selected to complete.  Traditional rules of Mahjongg apply. Players pick two identical tiles from a stacked board to remove them with the goal to empty it. The game shows the available matches, remaining tiles and free tiles. There are buttons to undo moves, get hints or shuffle the board. Some new elements are introduced as well. The board can be completed early by uncovering the Magic Gold tiles and removing them. This causes all the other tiles to disappear. Other novelties are season, flower and cardinal direction tiles. Any of the four seasons, flowers or cardinal directions can be matched with another one in the series to make them disappear. In later levels, there are also key tiles that open locks, joker tiles to remove all specific tiles of a certain kind on the board, and magnets used to pull tiles to a new position.  The game keeps track of the completion time and an overall score. In Dynasty Adventure levels need to be unlocked one by one, and after completing a board a pearl of wisdom is offered. This game is largely a re-skin of the earlier game Mahjong Escape: Ancient Japan by the same company. It includes the same tiles and gameplay options, but only in a Chinese setting.
