 Jill is a young baker who acquired her passion for baking from her grandparents in their bakery, Evans Bakery. When she returned from culinary school, she discovered Evans Bakery closed down because a "Mega-Mart" moved in. Jill decides to show the mega corporation what her family's baking is all about and opened her own bakery in order to earn enough money to buy back Evans Bakery. Can Jill handle the pressure of running her own business and beat Mega-Mart?  In Cake Mania, your job is to help Jill meet the monthly quota through 48 progressively difficult levels. This is no simple task because you will have to bake quickly as well as serve the customers quickly. There are a variety of different customers to serve. From nice old ladies to impatient holiday icons like Cupid! Each kind of customer have a different patience-level (indicated by the number of hearts). The longer they wait, the lower their patience. If they get too low, they will storm off and cost you money!  When a customer first enters your bakery, hand them a menu. Then they will give you their order (in the form of a thought bubble) and you will have to create that cake. If you create the wrong cake (wrong shape or wrong frosting, etc) then you will have to throw it away and start over (costing you more money). You start off with one oven and one frosting machine. Between levels you will have the opportunity to purchase upgrades or new items that will improve the bakery's. For example, you can purchase upgrade your oven to one that bakes faster or you can purchase a T.V. that will help improve customers' patience.
