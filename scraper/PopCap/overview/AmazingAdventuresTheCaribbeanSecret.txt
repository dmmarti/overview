 An explorer is hired by a museum to recover the "Caribbean Secret", a sunken Spanish ship filled with gold treasure.  Amazing Adventures: The Caribbean Secret is the third entry in a series of hidden object titles with minimal plot and basic seek-and-find gameplay. Most of the time, the objective is to find and click on all the items listed at the bottom of the screen, on locations filled with assorted objects, within a time limit. The time and hint limits can be turned off in the options menu. Besides the list entries, there are two skulls on each screen that can be collected to unlock bonus modes. Some of the list entries are instructions about some action that has to be performed on the scene, like dragging and dropping an item to a specific place or object in the scenery. Clue entries have riddles about the object instead of its name.  There are mini-games at the end of each level, with implementations of well-known concepts like a tile-matching game where two adjacent tiles have to be swapped on a grid to make them disappear, a word search challenge, a spot-the-differences game with two similar pictures, a variation of the differences game where the player has to replace the missing bits between two similar images, jigsaw and picture puzzles, a memory game with pairs of identical figures, and other similar challenges.
