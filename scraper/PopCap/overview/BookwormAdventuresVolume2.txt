 Lex the Bookworm is eating his breakfast, a bowl of letters, when suddenly a troubled Mother Goose appears, running and screaming for help while being chased by the Big Bad Wolf. Lex starts to run after these characters until the trio falls inside an open book, starting an adventure on a fantasy landscape.  Bookworm Adventures Volume 2, like its predecessor, is a spelling game with light RPG elements. The player assumes the role of Lex fighting several characters taken from fables and folklore, with the two sides taking turns. The game is divided in chapters, each based on a poem or fairy tale story with a final boss character. After defeating the boss, Lex receives one of the treasures. These artifacts give special powers to fight the battles, increasing the attack power and helping in other ways. Lex can carry up to three treasures at the same time, and they can be selected along with a companion on a separate screen between chapters. These companions are mythic characters that take up one of the treasure slots and join Lex during the battle, giving potions, attacking the enemy and increasing positive statistics.
