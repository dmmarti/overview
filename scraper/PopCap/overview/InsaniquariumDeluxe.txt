 An independent developer's action game, Insaniquarium puts the player in the troublesome role of an aquarium owner- purchasing various kinds of fish, feeding them properly and on time, and watching them grow. Each fish drops various coins and trinkets; the larger and more picky the fish, the more valuable the trinkets he drops, from simple silver coins to fancy gold chests. Additionally, every once in a while a vicious alien will appear in the aquarium, trying to slaughter hapless fish and ending the whole enterprise prematurely.  Another twist comes in the form of pets. At the end of every level players are awarded a pet, which floats in the aquarium without demanding maintenance and adds some sort of beneficial bonus. Players are limited to using a maximum of three pets at a time.  Managing the various fish, fighting aliens, and making the right choices (from pets to various investments in the aquarium) gives the game a slight strategic appeal. The game also supports additional challenges such as time-trials, and includes a Virtual Aquarium which players can nurture purely for pleasure.
