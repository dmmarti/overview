 The theme in Escape Whisper Valley is you are trapped in a remote mountain type region of some American town that appears to be abandoned. You advance the context of escape by finding all of the hidden objects present collecting clues from the remote and deserted town of Whisper Valley.  Each screen has an items list at the bottom that must be found before progressing in levels or theme as most traditional hidden object games. Some objects require small interactivity to complete like putting a cork in a bottle or placing objects in some logical order. Some objects to be found are also listed as a clue or phrase such as ‘not go but’ requiring the player to find the correct road sign.  Just before level completion the player must complete a mini puzzle task with the game offering a different one from a selection of types from tile matching, crosswords, or match 3 etc. At the end of each level status for time, object counts, or achievements is also provided.
