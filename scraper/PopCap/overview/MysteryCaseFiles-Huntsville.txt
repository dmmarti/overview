 The quaint town of Huntsville is suddenly being plagued by a series of crime spree that the local authorities cannot figure out. This is why you, a young detective, are asked to tackle this case and bring in a new perspective.  This is the first in the MCF series. You will have to investigate a number of locations and seek out a list of clues. The game works like I SPY and Where's Waldo? where you will have to have to find a number of items in a really busy looking scene. Each case will have a set number of items to uncover and a time limit to find them. When you've completed that task, you will have to unscramble a puzzle that will unveil the culprit of the case. There are 20 cases in all. Can you become the Master Detective?
