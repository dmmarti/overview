 Feeding Frenzy is back with 60 more levels, new powerups, new fish and a new above water area. Start out as a small fish in the big ocean as you try to find out why there are so many shipwrecks lately. Eat the smaller fish and avoid the larger fish as you work your way up through the food chain.  As you eat fish, you will grow and be able to eat even larger fish. You can also get powerups that allow you to move really fast, stun other fish, make larger fish shrink so you can eat them and much more. As you progress, you will change fish from that small fish up to a great white shark. Remember, though, that even as a shark, you can still be eaten by other sharks or killer whales, so be careful.  New to the series, is an out-of-water experience. In some levels, you will have the opportunity to jump out of the water to eat mayflies and powerups. Jump high and do flips to score style points as well. But, watch out for the pelicans, who will be happy to eat you as you jump out of the water.  One more new thing in the game are the Midnight Zones. These levels are too deep for light to reach them. If you want to see what you are doing, you'll need to eat plankton to give you enough light to see. There are the same two game modes as on the original... normal "campaign" style and Time Attack.
