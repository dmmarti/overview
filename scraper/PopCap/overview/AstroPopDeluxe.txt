 AstroPop is an arcade puzzle game with similar gameplay to Magical Drop. The objective is to guide a space ship that stacks and shoots bricks. As the amount of bricks on top of the screen increases, you need to pop a target number of bricks with matching colours before the rows reach the bottom of the screen. By linking four bricks or more, you create chain reactions. To spice up the gameplay, there are special power-ups such as radial bombs, freeze bombs, column nukes and difficult obstacles such as toxic, steel and stone bricks.  Each of the four playable characters has a supa weapon that destroys all bricks on the screen. It can only be used after charging it. There are two playing modes: Classic with weapon upgrades and 32 levels per character and Survival in which you need to stay alive as long as possible.
