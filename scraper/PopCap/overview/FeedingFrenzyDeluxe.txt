 Survival of the quickest, strongest, and biggest in the deep-seas!  The player starts as a tiny fish trying to survive, but hunted, in an unknown underwater world full of killer predators. The player must collect power-ups and bonuses, avoid eating poisoned fish, bumping into mines or getting electrocuted. The player's goal is to eat their way up the food chain, all the way up to the Shark King, and become master of the deep-seas!  The game also shows a "Fun Fact" after each level, being a real life fact about sea creatures and plants, giving it the educational twist.
