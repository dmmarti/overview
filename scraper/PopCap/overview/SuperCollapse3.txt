The following eight game modes are available: ** Classic ** Quest ** Relapse ** Strategy ** Puzzle ** Slider ** Continuous ** Countdown Initially, only classic and quest modes are available. The rest can be unlocked by playing the quest mode. The classic mode works in the same way as in previous games. The player is presented with a grid that is partially filled with coloured blocks. More blocks are added to grid, one row at a time, from the bottom of the grid. The aim of the game is to remove these blocks before they reach the top of the screen. To remove blocks the player simply clicks a group of three or more like coloured blocks. Some special pieces exists such as bombs that blows up surrounding blocks.  In the quest mode the player enters a strange world where he progresses from level to level. For each level that is completed a new is made available. The quest mode features a store where the player can purchase different things for the money he earns for completing each level. For more money it's also play different casino mini games such as slot machines. All of the game modes are available in the quest mode and after a number of them have been completed they become unlocked for the player to play at any time. The relapse mode works like classic but new blocks come in from both top and bottom. In the strategy mode new block will only come in when the player clicks. In the puzzle mode the player has to clear all blocks from the screen and no new appear. In the slider mode the rows of blocks will slide left and right so that the groups changes. The continuous mode is an endless variant of the classic mode and the player has to last as long as possible.
