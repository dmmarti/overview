 Cosmic Bugs is the precursor to the game Water Bugs. An updated outer space version of the likes of Qix and JezzBall, the object of the game is to divide and clear a certain amount of the playing field. The playing field is filled with enemies who must be evaded and destroyed via being captured within a division. There are also enemies along the border of the playing field who must be treated in the same fashion but unlike their counterparts may fire on you when you are setting off a dividing line. Most enemies walk in random patterns and behave in an unintelligent manner but there are some enemies who will follow your cursor in order to block a division. There are also power-ups to get from destroyed enemies such as missiles, bombs and line enhancers. Look out however for power-downs that will make your job a little harder.
