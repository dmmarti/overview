 Mahjong Escape: Ancient Japan is a Mahjongg variant set against a background of Ancient Japan. In the Emperor's Adventure mode, players travel through the history of Japan, starting from 8500 BC to 1912 AD. In the second, Classic game mode, any of the 162 available layouts can be selected to complete. Players can also choose from different backgrounds and tileset designs.  Traditional rules of Mahjongg apply. Players pick two identical tiles from a stacked board to remove them with the goal to empty it. The game shows the available matches, remaining tiles and free tiles. There are buttons to undo moves, get hints or shuffle the board. Some new elements are introduced as well. The board can be completed early by uncovering the Magic Gold tiles and removing them. This causes all the other tiles to disappear. Other novelties are season, flower and cardinal direction tiles. Any of the four seasons, flowers or cardinal directions can be matched with another one in the series to make them disappear. In other tilesets, these are replaced by other designs with a similar functionality. In later levels, there are also key tiles that open locks, joker tiles to remove all specific tiles of a certain kind on the board, and magnets used to pull tiles to a new position.  The game keeps track of the completion time and an overall score. In Emperor's Adventure levels need to be unlocked one by one, and after completing a board a pearl of wisdom is offered.
