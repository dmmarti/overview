 Mystery P.I.: The Vegas Heist is a standard hidden object game. The player takes the role of a detective trying to find four billions dollars stolen from the vault of a casino.  Las Vegas is represented as a series of static screens filled with objects. The player must find and click on several things listed at the left of the screen, within a time limit.  Four mini-games appear between locations. Three of them are puzzle variations, where the pieces have to be dragged, swapped, and rotated to reassemble a picture. The fourth mini-game is crosswords using letters that resemble a ransom note.  The player can turn on an option for unlimited hints. Otherwise, hints cost 7500 points, and there's a waiting period before they can be used again.
