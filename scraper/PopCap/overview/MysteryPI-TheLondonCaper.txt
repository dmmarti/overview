 Mystery P.I.: The London Caper is another installment in a series of straightforward hidden object games with minimal plot. This time, the private investigator is hired by the British royal family to retrieve their stolen crown jewels. The game remains very similar to the previous entries, where the main objective is to find and click on all the items listed at the left side of the screen, on locations around the U.K. capital filled with assorted paraphernalia scattered around cluttering the scenery.  Certain settings can be tweaked in the options menu to adjust the difficulty level, enabling or disabling a time limit and changing the number of hints available. Some of the list entries are riddles or pending tasks instead of the object name, giving clues about the hidden item or instructions about an action that have to be performed. A crown, a key and a pair of handcuffs can be found on every location, giving bonus points and unlocking extra modes when all twenty-five of each one are collected. The hint button shows the position of one of the required items, but takes some time to recharge after use.  Mini-games appear on a separate screen at the end of each chapter. They are implementations of classic games and puzzles, where the player has to swap pairs of tiles on a grid to match three or more of the same kind and make them disappear, move blocks inside a limited space to create an exit path for a key, assemble jigsaw puzzles and complete other similar challenges. The tile-matching game can be played from the main menu after one of the extra modes is unlocked. The other unlockable mode is called Unlimited Seek-And-Find, where the player has to revisit every location and collect more than 2,000 hidden objects.
