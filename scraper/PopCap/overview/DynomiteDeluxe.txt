 Dynomite is a revised version of Raptisoft's Eggsucker and has similar gameplay to Bust-A-Move. You launch colored dino eggs upwards from a swivable slingshot launcher to break groups of slowly descending egg patterns. At least 3 of similar color must be touching for them to break and large groups cracked elicit a witty shout from a dino character and bonus points. Cracking groups in succession will also bring shouts of ever increasing "combos" until a bomb is rewarded which explodes a large area of any eggs it contacts and pushes the descending egg field upwards temporarily.  Some eggs will shake and if they are cracked in time, a dino baby will hatch giving a bonus. Certain eggs will also, if cracked, give extra points, mutiply scores, widen the play area, or show the route path of your launched egg for easy targeting.  There are four different play modes:  Endless Mode - eggs continue falling at ever increasing speeds. Occasionally when a timer runs down, a pterodactyl named Whirly will fly from the bottom of the screen and if not hit before he reaches the screen top, will drop a new color of egg making the game harder. He will fly ever faster each time he appears and is shot.  Stomped Mode - Each screen is a set pattern of eggs that all must be cleared to move to another screen. Every set number of eggs fired, Mama Brontosaurus will stomp the screen down one row.  Fossil Challenge - A prehistoric fossil trapped among the eggs must be freed by cracking all eggs surrounding it. There's two submodes - Strategic, where the screen remains static or Panic, where it will descend one row for every set number of shots taken.  Time Trial - Simply clear all eggs in the quickest time possible in a choice of 3 different difficulty levels.
