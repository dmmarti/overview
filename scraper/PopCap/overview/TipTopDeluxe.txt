 TipTop is a matching game with three modes, using fruits, bells and other slot machine symbols for its tiles. The player has to make arrangements of three or more icons of the same type, by selecting a column and adding a new tile to make them disappear. If the pile gets too high or too deep, touching the top or the bottom of the screen, the game is over.  On regular mode, each click makes one tile fall to the top of the column and another one float up to the bottom. The goal is to fill a wavy meter at the right side of the screen with successful matches. In the strategy mode, the player adds both the falling and floating tiles in separate turns. In the speed mode, the floating tiles are added automatically every few seconds.  Special tiles appear randomly on the gamefield. The magnet pulls a column upwards to the next row. The anvil is the opposite, pushing the column downwards one row. The joker face becomes a copy of the same type when touching other tile. The color bomb removes all tiles of the same type it lands on. The dynamite stack explodes one whole column.  There is a bonus puzzle game between levels, where the objective is to clear the screen before time runs out.
