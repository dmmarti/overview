 The Forgotten Dynasty is an installment in the Amazing Adventures hidden object game series. The player is again a historian sent out by a museum. The destination is China: strange artifacts have surfaced in the black market and there are also rumours about the unknown, forgotten dynasty that could be older than the oldest known Emperor. In 25 different locations the player has to find hidden items or, rarely, perform an action with given items (e.g. find a match, light a candle with it and then put it into the lantern). For every successful action the player is rewarded with points. One can gain more points for discovery in quick succession from the previous one or lose points for using the hint system. The main mission is divided in 25 missions. Each is divided into two to seven levels. Each hidden object level is followed by mini-game, e.g. spot ten differences, jigsaw puzzles, memory game or a match-three game. In addition, in every hidden object location there are two yin and yang symbols. After finding all 50 symbols, two bonus modes are unlocked: unlimited access to all hidden object locations and unlimited levels of match-three games.  The game offers two modes of difficulty. The first is limited by time and longer times between recharging the hint button. The relaxed mode removes the time limit and the hints are given at any time. For every completed mission the player is rewarded with several Mahjong titles and a short, educational description about various aspect of the Chinese culture, history or other trivia.
