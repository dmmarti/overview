 Rocket Mania! Deluxe is a simple strategy game with strong similarities to the arcade game Cachat. The player must try to get the flame of a fuse from one side of the screen to the rocket (fireworks) on the other. Do this by rotating the tile pieces of the fuse to connect from one side to the other. There are three modes of gameplay.   Classic: This is a timed game in which you have to launch a certain number of rockets in a set time.  Arcade: This is a more fast paced game in which you have to "burn up" the fuses as they drop from the top of the screen by rotating them to connect one side to the other. If a column reaches the top you lose.  Strategy: This mode is untimed and slow paced. Practice and get high scores by getting multiple rocket launches. You have a certain number of matches and have to get more by setting off three or more rockets to drop more matches, Then pick up matches by "burning up" the fuse tile it is on. When you run out of matches its game over.  With all three modes you can get better scores with multiple rocket launches as well as better fireworks. Collect items on certain fuse tiles for bonuses like coins and gems. Coins are thrown out by the crowd watching your fireworks display and are used for upgrading your rockets for a better show.
