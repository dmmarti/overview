 Following the tradition established by previous installments of the series, Riddle of the Two Knights is a hidden object game with a vast collection of mini-games. The player assumes the role of an adventurer who is sent out by the museum to collect chess figures that belong to a recently unearthed chessboard from the middle ages. There is one significant change from the previous games - instead of one mini-game that follows one hidden object screen, all the mini-games are huddled together at the very end of each mission. There are 25 missions in total, each containing one to seven hidden object screens (25 different locations throughout Europe and the Mediterranean) and several mini-games. The mini-games include jigsaw-puzzle, rotating puzzle, position-swapping puzzle, find-words, mahjong, sliding tiles puzzle and seek-two-or-more mini-game. All actions taken by the player are awarded by points - 2000 for finding an item, extra points for finding items in quick succession, fifteen thousand points for finding all of the items without using the hint button, correctly made step in mini-game etc. The player can lose points as well - by using the hint button or by repeated miss-clicking in the screen. One can play with time-limit or without it, with slowly re-charging hint button or with immediately available one. Apart from the regular items or clues that have to be found to finish every hidden object scene, there are two items unlisted. In this instalment of the series the player should look for crowns - after collecting all fifty of them, two bonus modes are accessed: unlimited search for hidden objects on all maps and seek-two-or-more mini-game.
