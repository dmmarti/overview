 This casual game is set in a fictitious Far East, among coastal ports and and a secret floating pirate city. Players select a playable character and begin sailing among seven ports, buying goods at low prices and selling them elsewhere at high prices.  In the ports, players click on and enter various buildings: Bankers store your money where it accrues interest and is safe from thieves, but where you cannot spend it. Moneylenders will help you in your time of need for a steep price. Taverns offer tips and insider information about the markets. Port Authorities warn of pirate attacks, and pay bounties on the defeated enemies. Shipyards offer repairs, new ships, and more cannons (at the cost of cargo space).  At sea, the player encounters pirates and fights them in a simple turn-based battle. Players can target specific ships for their fleet to focus on, or attempt to flee.  As the game progresses, more powerful ships become available, more valuable goods enter the market, and more deadly enemies scour the seas looking for prey.
