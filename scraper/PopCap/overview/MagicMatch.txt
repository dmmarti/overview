 Magic Match is a "Match 3" game in which the player is presented with a board that has a random arrangement of pieces. The player is challenged to drag the mouse cursor over chains of 3 or more identical pieces in order to make the pieces vanish, the score increase, and the other pieces reshuffle. A certain number of each type of piece on each game board must be collected in this manner before time runs out for that board. There are also magic spells that rearrange the pieces on the board or swap 2 pieces of the player's choosing, useful for when the board reaches a state where no more chains of 3 are available.  Magic Match features an elaborate tale in which the player is actually a wizard's apprentice traveling across a fantasy landscape on a quest. The player progresses through 6 stages with many levels of increasing difficulty and earns higher magic ranks with better scores. The game features an imp named Giggles who tutors you as you play and helps explain extra options and obstacles that appear on the game board (such as a coin that acts as a wildcard piece or a plus sign that will grant bonus time to complete the board).  Magic Match also allows for dueling options. Either a human player can play against the computer with configurable difficulty, or 2 humans can play against each other using what the game calls "Mouse Party"-- 2 mice hooked up to the same computer.
