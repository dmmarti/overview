 Word Harmony is a word game with a Japanese art theme, in which the player manipulates physically-simulated "letter balls" to accomplish different goals, depending on the mode.  In Puzzle mode, the challenge is to match a set of words on a list by manipulating the balls through an often complex environment. Tsunami is a real-time mode in which the player must make words out of letters dropping into a pool. Finally, Think mode is a mental challenge in which the player must find a set of words that perfectly uses up all the letters provided.
