 Gâ€™day mate we are going on holiday down under with Vacation Quest: Australia! All of the scenes throughout the game are vacation theme settings from the outback, beaches, and coast line to the landmark Sydney Opera House.  Each screen contains items listed at the bottom that must be found before you can explore other locations or extend your vacation and unlock additional scenes as with most hidden object games. Some objects require small interactivity to complete like placing batteries in the flashlight in addition to standard single word item search. To complete a level the player is presented a mini puzzle which can be one of several styles from tile matching, crosswords, or match 3 to name a few. Current status is provided at the end of each level for points, time elapsed, and objects found etc.
