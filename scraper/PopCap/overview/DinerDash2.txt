 The news is dire. Mr. Big has tripled the rent on the local restaurants in an effort to push them out of business so that he can build his Mega Multiplex Foodplaza.  Flo, with 5 of her own restaurants already up and running, has returned to help her friends make enough to pay the rent so they won't lose their restaurants.  Help Flo as she takes orders and delivers food to the customers in different kinds of restaurants including a roadside diner and a Mexican cantina. Seat the customers, take their orders and deliver their food before they get upset and leave. Then, clean their tables off and seat the next customers.  Diner Dash 2: Restaurant Rescue brings in some new customers, such as the cellphone addict and the bookworm as well as introducing families with crying babies. Some new objects include highchairs, a mop, and a phone to call for assistance.  You can play Diner Dash 2 in story mode or in endless shift mode. After each level of the story mode, you can upgrade your restaurant. If you got expert on that level, you will have 3 choices instead of 2. Save the four restaurants in story mode to unlock a secret restaurant.
