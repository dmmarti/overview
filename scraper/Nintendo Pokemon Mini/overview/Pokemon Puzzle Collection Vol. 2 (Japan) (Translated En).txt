Pokémon Puzzle Collection Vol. 2 is the Japan only sequel to Pokémon Puzzle Collection. Two puzzles return: Motion Puzzle, where tiles are switch around to form the correct Pokémon image, and Shadow Puzzle, where shapes are rotated and placed to form a Pokémon's relative silhouette. There are also two new puzzles. In Pick-Up Puzzle, an arrangement of Poké Balls lies on the floor. The player's Pokémon must clear them by moving over them in one line without isolating any of them. And in Stretch Puzzle, a grid is shown, with black and white boxes. The white boxes are empty, and the black boxes have numbers on them. The numbers represent bars that can be extended to take up the empty spaces. The goal is to fill up each empty space, meaning the placement of the bars is crucial to success.
