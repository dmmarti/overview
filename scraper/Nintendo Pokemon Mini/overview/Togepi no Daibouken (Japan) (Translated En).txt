Togepi no Daibōken is an action puzzle game similar to Kirby Tilt 'n' Tumble in that the player controls a Togepi who is rolling around like a ball. Traditional controls are used rather than motion controls for movement, though the Pokémon mini system's built-in tilt sensor is occasionally used for escaping when Togepi gets stuck in a hole. Togepi was peacefully walking through the forest when a Fearow noticed it. The Fearow grabs Togepi and takes it to its nest on the top of a tower. Togepi tries to escape, but trips on a pebble, and starts rolling around. The player must guide Togepi down the stairs. Many hazards exist, including bottomless pits, cracked floors, bumpers and many more too numerous to list. Sometimes, the stairs are covered by a door, and puzzles must be solved to open them, such as rolling over floor switches or knocking other Pokémon into holes. At the end each tower is a boss Pokémon, who is fought when they also trip on a pebble and start rolling. Boss arenas are small platforms surrounded by a bottomless pit. They must by rolled into and knocked into the abyss to be defeated.
