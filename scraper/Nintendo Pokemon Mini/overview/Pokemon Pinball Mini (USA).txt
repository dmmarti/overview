Pokemon Pinball mini is the second Pokemon Pinball game. The game consists of 90 levels total. Diglett, Pikachu, Clefairy, Wobbuffet, and Poliwag are used as plungers, but the levels restrict which plungers are used. There are three modes: Quest, the main mode, has 70 levels. Capture levels are found only in Quest mode. Each level must be completed to unlock the next, unlike the other two modes. It consists mainly of Fill Hole and High Score levels. In Fill Hole levels the goal is to get a Poke Ball into each hole before the timer runs out. In High Sore levels, the goal is to race against the timer and surpass a minimum score. Getting a Poke Ball into a hole normally earns 1 point, and getting a Poke Ball into a hole with a power shot earns 3 points. Capture levels involve capturing the Pokemon walking across the screen. Hitting it with Poke Balls reduces its HP, and when it faints, hitting it again will capture it. The player must shoot the now-heavier Poke Ball into the hole. Time Attack mode features 10 Fill Hole levels, all of which are immediately available. Score Attack mode features 10 High Score levels, all of which are, again, immediately available.
