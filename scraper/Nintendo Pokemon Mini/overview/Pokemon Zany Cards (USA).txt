Pokémon Zany Cards is a collection of card games based on the Pokémon television series and featuring some characters exclusive to it. There are four game modes. Wild Match is for 1 to 5 players. The players must put matching cards down on the table in order to win coins. Whoever has the most coins at the end wins. Pairs aren't the only accepted matches, as there are many different combos that are worth more coins, like putting all three starter Pokémon of Johto down. Special Seven is also for 1 to 5 players. Whoever gets rid of all their cards first wins. Players match cards by traditional suit or by Pokémon on the table. Some cards also have special abilities to change suit, or other effects. Card Duel can only be played by 2 players via infrared connection. Both players have the same cards, and whoever plays the highest value card wins. Four Kings is 1 player only. It is like Solitaire, but the card piles must be in a specific order and topped off with the Magikarp card.
