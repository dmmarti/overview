Pokémon Tetris is a Pokémon-themed game of Tetris. It is possible to play in multiplayer mode, and there are some game modes, including classic endless mode. In singleplayer mode, the definitive goal is to collect all Pokémon, thus completing the Pokédex, for a total of 250. As usually, there are more and less rare Pokémon: if common Pokémon are collected by clearing four lines at once, rarer ones can be caught clearing the screen from 5 lines with one move, which is possible as five-block pieces start to fall in advanced stages.
