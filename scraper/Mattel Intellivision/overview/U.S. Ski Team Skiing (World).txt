In U.S. Ski Team Skiing, players race down the hill, avoiding trees and jumping moguls in their path. The game features both slalom and downhill courses. 1 player may race against the clock, or 2 to 6 players can alternate turns and race to see who gets the fastest time, and each race has 3 heats.

Both downhill and slalom courses have 15 different slope grade settings to affect acceleration. 4 different settings for overall game speed are also available.
