Three games in one! Triple Action features three uniquely different arcade games:

1. Racing Cars - Race side-by-side down the highway against an opponent, dodging standard traffic as you go. First one to 100 miles wins!

2. Battle Tanks - Get in a tank and fight another player, hiding behind cover as you go. Choose between long-range or short-range bullets, or the ability for the bullets to bounce off objects for a true strategic challenge.

3. Biplanes - Get into the cockpit of a biplane, fighting another player with either short or long range bullets. Hit the balloon for an extra point, but don't stall! First to 15 wins.

Each game is specifically designed for two-players, resulting in a unique party game.
