World Series Major League Baseball is a baseball sports game that supports both ECS and Intellivoice (for play by play announcements). The game is based on real baseball player statistics (even though the names had been changed to fictional ones before the release) and offers baseball games using multiple cameras (including in-game split-screen), showing the game in a 3D display rather than side-scrolling fashion.

It supports two players simultaneously, where a center camera is used to show pitcher and batter. While one player chooses the pitch type, the batter decides when to swing or bunt. The screen then switches to an external camera view for the defending player to control the fielders, while the other player handles the baserunners. The games can be saved and loaded through the RAM chip on the cartridge.
