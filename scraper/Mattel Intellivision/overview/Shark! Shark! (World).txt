In Shark! Shark! you control a fish! Your goal is to earn as many points as possible while staying alive. Swimming in the ocean with you are other fish of various sizes, lobsters, crabs, jellyfish, and a very fast shark. You are able to eat any fish that is smaller in size than you are, and any fish that is larger will eat you! The shark can also be killed if you nibble at its tail several times, but careful for the shark can turn quickly. Each time you eat a fish or nibble on the sharks tail, points are earned. Each time you score 1000 points, your fish will grow larger in size allowing you to eat even more of the fish on the screen. Several different game speeds are included, and one or two players can play.
