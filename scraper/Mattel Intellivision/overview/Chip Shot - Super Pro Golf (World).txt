Chip Shot: Super Pro Golf is an update of the PGA Golf game released earlier for the Intellivision. The two games, however, share no similarities. Chip Shot: Super Pro Golf contains much more features, including a "swing meter" that determines if your shot hooks or slices, a full set of clubs that behave differently then others, wind differences, obstacles such as trees (which actually can vary in size and height), a dynamic putting system, and the ability to design your own course. For one or two players.
