A one or two player "Dungeons & Dragons"-style dungeon crawl.  In a one-player game, the player controls the Warrior Prince on his quest to collect treasures, learn the secrets of the Fortress of the Sinister Serpent, and locate the Serpent's lair. In a two-player game, the right player controls the Warrior Prince, while the left player controls Nilrem the Wizard.

As you explore the labyrinthine fortress you can collect treasures, magic scrolls, and healing items while battling Phantom Knights and Red Sorcerers.  But be careful -- if your adversaries catch you, you can lose half a life, and may need to be "reincarnated."  Each player has only 9 Reincarnations, and when those are gone, it's "Game Over."
