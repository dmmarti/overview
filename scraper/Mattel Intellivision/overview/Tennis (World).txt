Tennis is a singles tennis game for two players. The game follows standard tennis rules, and allows you to hit both forehand and backhand shots to any location on the court.  Whether serving or volleying, you have the choice of hitting the ball hard or soft, and you may hit either a lob or a regular ground stroke. The game allows you to set the difficulty by selecting one of four different speeds.
