In Sub Hunt you control a group of four submarines one at a time. The goal is to destroy six convoys which will be attempting to cross the stretch of sea you are guarding. You can aim and fire torpedoes using a periscope view, have your submarine dive and surface, and adjust your speed. An overhead display allows you to strategically move your submarines in the position of your choice. There are five difficulty levels to choose from.
