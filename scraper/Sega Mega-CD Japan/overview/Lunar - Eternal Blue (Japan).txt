 This is the original version of the second title in  Lunar series.  The events of the game take place hundred years after those of the first "Lunar". You control Hiro, a young treasure hunter who likes exploring various caves and ruins with his trusty companion, the wise-cracking pink flying cat Ruby (who claims to be a baby dragon). One day he meets a mysterious blue-haired girl named Lucia. She explains that she has come from the nearby Blue Star and now needs his help in order to defeat a dark being called Zophar. Bewitched by the girl's beauty, Hiro agrees to help Lucia, and soon finds himself opposing the ruling religion of the world, and shadows from the past.  This is a console-style RPG with turn-based combat viewed from top-down perspective, like the rest of the game. You fight with a party where each member belongs to a particular class and fights using his/her own techniques. Anim√©-style cut scenes are included to advance the story.
