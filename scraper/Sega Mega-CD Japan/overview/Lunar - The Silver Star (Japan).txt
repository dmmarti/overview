 The hero of Lunar: The Silver Star is Alex, a young boy whose ideal is the great warrior of the past,  Dragonmaster Dyne. But in order to become a Dragonmaster, Alex has to find the four great dragons who will grant him the permission. The girl Luna, with whom Alex is in love, accompanies him on his journey. But soon the young people discover that something, or someone, is trying to change the face of the world by resurrecting the ancient goddess Althena, with Luna being a key element in the plan.  Lunar: The Silver Star is a traditional Japanese-style RPG with turn-based battles. The characters in your party have distinct class attributes (fighter, priest, magic user, etc.). It is possible to move the characters over the battle field, which can sometimes prove strategically important (for example, spreading the characters to avoid being hit by an area spell).
