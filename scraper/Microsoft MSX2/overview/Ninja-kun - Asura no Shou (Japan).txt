The game tells another story in Ninja-kun series. This time itâ€™s a platform game with some twists. There are two tasks alternating through levels: you are required either to kill every enemy in the level (as in the previous games) or simply to reach the exit. Running into enemies usually wonâ€™t kill you, however if you are hit by a single projectile, youâ€™ll have to start from a checkpoint. Enemies vary from plain ninjas to giant skeletons or killer fish. Each level has a time limit, and when this limit is close to an end a fire wheel of death will appear on the screen, chasing Ninja-kun.    Ninja-kun has some techniques for successful progression though the levels: many enemies can be temporarily stunned by jumping on them or hitting them from below; and ninja can obtain some power-ups including boomerang, bombs, a devastating fire attack or invincibility. Ninja-kun is capable of wall climbing and wall jumping, the latter requiring some practice from the player.    The levels (called â€œscenesâ€  in-game) are scattered through mountains, caves, beaches and underwater locations. You can choose which set of levels youâ€™ll start in by playing a mini-game at the beginning.
