In most games you have to attack monsters as a hero. In this case you are the reincarnation of the creature of Dr. Frankenstein. The opponents, however, remain monstrous. Mon Mon Monster is an arcade platform game with some touches of adventure. With your monster, you have to make your way through a maze of screens. Your path is blocked at all times by boulders and annoying creatures. The action takes place over the entire screen with the exception of some information at the bottom. In the fields you can find lots of useful objects such as "rocks", the normal method of defeating an opponent is simply done with the fire button. With this you reach the effect of a punch stroke or when you are standing at a distance, you shoot a projectile. You throw the boulders using a combination of the stick and 2nd fire button. Not really easy but practice makes perfect. You can also find extra life or supplement the remaining energy. Even secret passages are not lacking in this game nor are difficult passages such as water fountains. With a press of the STOP key you pause the game and a card is also placed on the screen. On that card you can read your current posfty as well as the screens you have already viewed and also the position of the Boss is indicated. However, this card does not help you much, since you still have to reach your goal through secret passages. I have not yet finished the first internship.

However, you will still start at the beginning of the internship, but items that have been retained will be retained.
