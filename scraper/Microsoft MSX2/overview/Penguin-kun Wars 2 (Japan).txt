Penguin-Kun Wars 2 is the follow-up to Penguin-Kun Wars. It is similar to the original in that it is a game of dodgeball, with the goal being to hit the opponent the most amount of times to win the match and advance up the leader board. It has a wider variety of stages than its predecessor, including a garden stage, an ice stage, and a jungle stage, among others.
