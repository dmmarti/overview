Strategic Mars is a shooter from dB-Soft. You start the game from player base, where you can buy upgrades when you get enough points from shooting enemies. At first you can upgrade your engine, repair the ship and get missiles which launch automatically against every enemy wave you face.    You navigate and warp to fight enemies from the map screen, which tells you the difficulty of the enemies. Fuchsia dots have the easiest enemies and red icons the hardest. Once you clear all enemies from the map, you move to the next level. There are 12 levels in total, and you can even start from the last level if you so wish from the start screen, no passwords needed.
