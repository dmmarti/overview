Giant Gram is the sequel to the ST-V/Saturn "puroresu" title "All Japan Pro Wrestling Featuring Virtua". Both titles feature AJPW superstars, as well as Virtua Fighter characters. Japanese "puroresu" is all about fighting spirit and appeal. Gimmicks and soap opera theatrics do not get you "over" the way they do  in the US of A. It's all about ability, athleticism, and sportsmanship.
