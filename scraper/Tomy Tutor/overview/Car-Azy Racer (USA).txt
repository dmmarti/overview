Car-Azy Racer's main goal is to reach the end of your journey before nightfall. Although there are various screens, the basic layout remains the same. A window of text at the bottom of each screen explains the situation as well as the current question. The questions are comprised of fourth and fifth grade level math and grammar, related to three main stops on your journey: the Gas Station, the Stadium and finally the Pizza Parlor. Between each destination you are behind the wheel, your score displayed on the odometer.
