Pyramid is a single player text adventure. The player takes the role of an archaeologist. The game starts in a tent on the site of an excavation. The object of the game is to explore the site and to recover four treasures and bring them back to the tent. Progress through the game is measured by the player's score, the maximum possible score being 100. The game's parser allows the player to enter long commands but it assumes that the last word is an object and the first word is a verb, ignoring all the rest. So 'Go very slowly and quietly to the West' is interpreted as 'Go West'. The game does allow two part commands such as Put Sword at which point the game will ask 'Where ' and the player responds with 'Table' or whatever is appropriate.
