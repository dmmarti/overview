Impact! is a clone of Asteroids that keep most of the gameplay features of the original arcade game. The player controls a spaceship that is surrounded by asteroids moving around him. The player has to destroy these by shooting at them. Larger asteroids are split into smaller ones that has to be shot until they are fully destroyed. Controls involve rotating the ship left and right, using thrust to move forward and brake to slow down. A hyperspace jump can also be used to avoid collisions. Keys used can be redefined by the player. The alien saucers from the original game are however not included. Upon colliding with an asteroid one life is lost. The player starts out with three lives.
