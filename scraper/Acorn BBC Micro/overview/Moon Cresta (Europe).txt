	Converting Nichibutsu's arcade shoot 'em up to home systems of the day, Moon Cresta was a rare deviation from complex adventure/strategy games from Incentive (of Freescape fame).    The action involves moving along the base of the screen, while wave after wave of aliens come towards you. The yellow aliens split when shot, while the magenta ones are the toughest of all. Once the coast is clear you must manually dock, with a points bonus on offer.
