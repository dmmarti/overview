Buster the clown has to burst all the balloons on each level in the correct sequence of colours ? red, green, yellow and blue ? by throwing a ball into the air, and he can only burst one balloon at a time. He also has a time limit to beat. It really is a children's game and it shows. For a start, it's a bit easy, and each time you lose, you can simply restart from the level you were on.
