The evil Morris has kidnapped Zany Kong. Your objective is to collect the keys to release him from the steel cage in which Morris has him imprisoned. You must collect the keys before your bonus reaches zero. Avoid the Snappers, the Aardvark Birds and the electric spikes, or try and squash them by dislodging the apples and pineapples.
