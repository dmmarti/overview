	The Earth Space Agency sure has had some problems lately. All but one of its starships have been wiped out by those ruthless Xtardan aliens. How will mankind survive with just one ship against such a menace? I sure hope it manages to find a capable commander to lead the attack...    Yes, you're the commander of the only ship standing between Earth and an alien menace. Select the difficulty of game you wish to play and this will dictate how many alien ships you must hunt down and how many battlestations are present that you can recharge at. Navigating your ship about the randomly generated 10x10 grid of quadrants, you must hunt down the enemy ships and destroy them before your time runs out. Of course, asteroid fields and suchlike wait to be discovered if you jump into various uncharted sectors, but that's part of the fun of space travel.    With a heavy "Star Trek" feel to the game (see the front cover, or the damage screen in game, to see what I mean), and the quadrant jumping, the game has a similar feel to Starship Enterprise, but this game came out first.
