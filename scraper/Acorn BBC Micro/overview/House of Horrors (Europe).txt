For some unexplained reason, you decide to enter a creepy-looking building and then find yourself locked inside! You must move your stick-man figure around a maze-like plan of the building and reach the exit. Along the way, you'll encounter the tenants (and hazards) which present a challenge. Each challenge is a mini-game including hangman, maths tests, shooting a vampire, picking the correct door, and many more.
