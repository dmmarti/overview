A freak storm has destroyed fruit farmer Fred's crop and the only solution from being ruined is to enter Castle Kadenza in Trasylvania and collect as much fruit as possible in the dark cellars. Forbidden Fruit is a top view single screen maze game where you move Fred around the screen collecting the fruit or just leave the fruit and exit each screen. Each fruit if collected is collected in order and you are told which fruit is next and when you want to leave the screen then a key must be collected before leaving by a locked door. Also on the screen are various creatures and monsters and these can be avoided or shot with your laser but you can only fire left or right. If you touch a creature or allow a timer to reach zero then you lose one of three lives.
