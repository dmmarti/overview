You are Nathan Wigglesworth, Flyer Supreme in this single screen game viewed from the side, and you are the pilot of a hot-air balloon who has to navigate around the screen to get to an exit over 26 levels. With your co-pilot, T.C. Barton you must avoid touching the walls and other objects that will cause your balloon to burst and lose one of five lives. The balloon sways constantly but the balloon does stay in the same position when not moving. The exit has a timer counting down and the quicker you get to it the more bonus points you receive and there is also a square that can be collected for more points. Once you reach the exit you receive an extra life and on later levels there are magnets that slowly drag you towards them.
