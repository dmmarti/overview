Your job is to paint the screen using your paintbrush and a few buckets of paint. Once your brush runs dry you will have to open a new bucket of paint and keep going. To make your job worse, various characters appear walking across your freshly painted surface leaving ugly footprints in their path. You have to cover those with more paint. Some of these characters can be killed by painting them, others will kill you.
