In Camelot, the player assumes the role of a deposed king, trying to prove his worthiness for the throne. The main goal of the game is to collect 3000 points by recovering bags of gold scattered around the flip-screen castle the game is set in. Killing enemies also increases the score, though in less amounts.nn
