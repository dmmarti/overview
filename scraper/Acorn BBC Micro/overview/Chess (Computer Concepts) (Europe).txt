Chess allows you to play a game of chess against either the computer or another player. All the rules of chess are included and the winner is the player that makes the other players King unable to move without being taken. Against the computer you are able to play as white or black and the computer has 10 skill levels (0-9) with zero being the easiest. You are also able to watch the computer play itself. There is also an Editor mode that allows you to set the board up with the pieces in any position you chose and you can attempt to get a mate in two or five moves as well.
