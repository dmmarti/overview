 One of the numerous Doom style games for the Amiga in the mid 90s. Like Gloom, it was published by Guildhall Leisure, who gave the Amiga a lot of time in that era.  Fears took the approach of having full-screen, though relatively low-resolution, graphics. The level landscapes feature lots of stairways and lifts, giving it a psuedo-3D feel. The game is played across 30 levels., with a level designer also included. The one-player game has 3 difficulty levels, while multi-player action is available via a null-modem cable.
