 Simon is just an ordinary boy in an extra-ordinary world. A world in which he must rescue Calypso the Wizard by embarking on a long challenging quest.  The game is a point-and-click adventure, using a typical interface with words such as ﾑUse', ﾑOpen', ﾑWalk To' unlike Lucasarts' SCUMM games a simple click on that area of the screen won't do and ﾑPick Up' again, a double-click on the item doesn't suffice  these two features extend game time significantly  The game's plot has a number of references and spoofs to fantasy and fairy tales, with the Three Billy Goats Gruff involved in a particularly significant scene. The humor is very British in places, with lots of dry sarcasm, and lots of Simpsons-esque self-references to the fact that this is a computer game. The levels are non-linear in layout, with puzzles spread across the lands.
