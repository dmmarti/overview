 Around the time of the Amiga version of Street Fighter 2, Amiga specialists Team 17 came up with a similar one on one beat 'em up, designed around the machine's strengths and weaknesses.  In one-player mode you have four characters to choose from - brothers Dan and Nik play identically, Lo-Ray is a Buddhist Monk, and Junior a failed boxer.  The opponents include a Ninja warrior, a businessman whose post-fight catchphrase is 'I'm sorry about that', and a thin Spanish girl. The backdrops feature lots of color and animation, varying from wrestling rings to building sites and beaches.  The control is designed around one-button controllers, with special moves generated by pushing in a certain direction and pressing fire, and one 'super special' move by holding fire for a few seconds. The real skill is in combining these moves effectively.
