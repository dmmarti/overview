 A more focussed effort than the earlier Impressions game Merchant Colony, High Seas Trader puts you in the shoes of a young impoverished nobleman who must take to the high seas where else? in order to regain fame and fortune.  You'll trade in a variety of goods, deal with banks and merchants, acquire property, and outfit your ship with guns, equipment, and crew.  Sailing is done from a first person perspective behind the ship's wheel.  The seas are, of course, never safe; pesky pirates will attempt to intercept you and relieve you of your worldly possessions.
