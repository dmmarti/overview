Leading Lap MPV is a three dimensional racing game with filled polygon graphics that can be played from a first person perspective or multiple third person perspectives. The game features a season mode as well as grudge matches that are multiplayer games played against a friend over a serial null modem connection.

Upon starting a new season the player first gets to choose a driver. There are five different ones and each has different statistics in terms of top speed, handling and braking. After that the player also gets to choose one of three vehicles (formula one, rally or endurance car). These differ in terms of top speed, braking and acceleration. When all choices have been made it's possible to jump straight into the first race of the championship or to practice on any of the game's race tracks. The game has a total of twelve tracks and these are played through in order. Each race is played against four AI drivers and points are awarded based on positions. To win the championship the player simply has to earn more points than the competitors.
