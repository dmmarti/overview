 Norway's Edgar M. Vigdal has converted several classic arcade games to the Amiga in his DeLuxe series. DGalaga is a thorough remake of Namco's classic Galaga, with lots of new nooks and crannies.  Just like the original, the main game play revolves around the player's spaceship, which can only move to the left at the right, firmly situated at the bottom of the screen. At the start of each screen, an enemy wave comes flying from one or several directions until they form a tight formation at the top. One after one, they swoop down towards you and fire. If they reach the bottom of the screen, they wrap around to the top and revert to their original position. There are lots of enemy types with various kinds of armours and missiles. The gameplay is spiced up by giant enemies joining the formations and a flying saucer that flies across the top of the screen, firing target seeking missiles.  As you shoot down enemies, some will release power-ups. Common power-ups give you better fire power and fire rate, others give you extra lives, extra points or money. One special item will teleport you to the memory station, where you play a memory game for bonuses. Another item-triggered sub-game is the asteroid field. The player must pass a long scrolling stretch of space, filled with space rocks of various sizes. Certain rocks give you money or points. Press the fire button, and you accelerate through the field. This is more dangerous, but rewarding if you pass the entire field, since you will then get a bonus score.  Once you complete a set of screens, you warp to the next level and enter the shop. Most of the game's upgrades are available here, at a price. Sometimes, the warp will malfunction, and you will be dropped off in limbo, where particularly powerful foes will strike at you. Defeat them, and you may resume your warp travel.
