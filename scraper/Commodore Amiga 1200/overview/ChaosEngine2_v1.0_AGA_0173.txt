 At the end of The Chaos Engine you managed to put a stop to Baron Fortesque's out of control machine, only to free the Baron himself from its clutches. Unfortunately not everything went to plan after that. During the confusion the Baron snuck away back into his own contraption and into another time period. Our two heroes decide the only way to stop him is follow him, but unfortunately luck isn't on their side...  Both players either two human or one human and one computer controlled are trapped within the Chaos Engine and can only escape by helping the Baron rebuild the engine. He will reward the character who helps him the most by granting him freedom, thus pitching our two heroes against each other.  Whereas The Chaos Engine was a two-player co-operative game, The Chaos Engine 2 is a two-player competitive game!
