 In the follow-up to Body Blows, Dan and Junior two characters from the original, based around programmers Danny Burke and Cedric McMillan Jr. are representing Earth in an intergalactic fight competition. Five other planets are involved, each submitting 2 brav fighters - the advanced Titanica, the divided Eclipse, the prehistoric Gellorn-5, the morphed Misma, and the matriachal Feminion.  Combat works in a similar way to the original, with moves designed around a one-button controller, with special moves activated either by a particular joystick movement while jumping, or by holding the fire button to charge the move up. The one-player game sees you progress through fighting the other characters in turn. Multiplayer options include character V character and a 4/8-player tournament.
