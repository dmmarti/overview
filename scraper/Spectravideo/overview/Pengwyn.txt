As any veteran gamer will have already realised, Pengwyn is based on Sega's Pengo. You guide your penguin around a maze made of ice blocks, and your task is to move three special blocks into a row. To do this, the penguin can crush blocks to get them out of the way, or push them so that they slide until they bump into something. Unfortunately, dangerous Snowbees live in some of the ice blocks and will come out to haunt the penguin. These, too, can crush the ice blocks, and the penguin's only chance of survival is to push ice blocks at them so that they are crushed in the process.
