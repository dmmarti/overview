Kitchen War is an arcade platform game with a food theme. The player controls a tomato chef whose kitchen has become overrun by insects and other vermin. Using weapons such as plates, forks, and ladles -- found in rooms through out the kitchen -- the player must defeat enough of a certain type of pest, such as a snail, spider, or mouse, to proceed to the next stage. Touching enemies will hurt the chef, though he can recover by finding bottles of ketchup which are also hidden within the rooms. Each weapon can only be used a certain number of times before another must be found.
