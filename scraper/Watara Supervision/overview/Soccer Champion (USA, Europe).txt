Soccer Champion is an overhead-view soccer game for one player. The player automatically controls the player closest to the ball, or the goalkeeper when he is visible. There are eight national teams to choose from, and two different modes. Exercise mode is a regular exhibition match against the computer, while Champion mode is a tournament where the player must defeat all the other teams in sequence. It is possible to choose between a three-minute, five-minute, and eight-minute game.
