Jacky Lucky is a side-scrolling platformer starring a man who carries a big stick. The player controls this man as he makes his way through each stage filled with enemies, most of which can be defeated with the stick but will also defeat our hero in a single hit, as well as destructible blocks that contain various items, including limited amounts of projectiles that can be thrown at enemies. At the end of each stage is a boss that must be defeated. There is also a bonus game between stages where the player can trade any coins they found for extra lives.
