Super Pang is a clone of the arcade game of the same title. The premise is simple: there are balloons bouncing around a room, and you must shoot and destroy them without getting hit. However, it's not that simple; when shot, the balloons will split into two smaller balloons, and only the smallest size will be destroyed when hit. There are several power-ups that will randomly appear to aid the player, including long-lasting shots, quick-fire shots, and scrolls that instantly reduce all balloons on the screen to the smallest size. Pop enough balloons to move onto the next stage.
