Tasac 2010 is a vertically-scrolling space shoot-'em-up game. The player controls a high-powered space fighter through ten stages, which each consist of several waves of smaller enemies followed by a large boss that must be destroyed. There are several power-ups to increase the ship's power, but one hit will destroy it causing all upgrades to be lost. There are two different shot types, and ten stages in total.
