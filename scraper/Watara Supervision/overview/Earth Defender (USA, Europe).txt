Earth Defender is an action shooting game, and a clone of Data East's Atomic Runner. The player controls an armored superhero fighting an alien invasion, and can freely move about the screen, even hovering in place using a jetpack. However, the screen is always scrolling forward, and it is impossible to backtrack. Each stage consists of a lengthy onslaught of flying enemies, followed by a boss at the end. There are also several power-ups that can be collected to increase the hero's firepower or refill his life.
