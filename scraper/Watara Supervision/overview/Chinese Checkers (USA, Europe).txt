Chinese Checkers is a digital version of the popular German board game originally known as Stern-Halma. The objective is to be the first player to move a group of 10 pieces to the opposite side of a star-shaped board; pieces can either be moved a single space, or 'jumped' over adjacent pieces. The game can be played in either its 2-player or 3-player variant, but only a single human player can play in a given game; other slots are filled by computer-controlled opponents. It is possible to set the number of rounds in the game, as well as also watch the computer play against itself.
