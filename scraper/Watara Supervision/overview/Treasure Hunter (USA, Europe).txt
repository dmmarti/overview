Treasure Hunter is a basic Boulder Dash clone. The player controls an explorer who digs through an underground cave in search of treasure. Each stage contains a number of boulders and treasures. Boulders will fall downward if there is nothing supporting them, and the player must be careful not to get crushed or trapped. The goal is to collect a certain number of treasures, which will open the gate to the next stage. There is also a strict time limit.
