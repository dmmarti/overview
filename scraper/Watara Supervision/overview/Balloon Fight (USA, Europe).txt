Balloon Fight is a simple platform action game very similar to the better known NES title of the same name. The player controls a creature suspended by a pair of balloons who floats around a room, and must pop the balloons of enemy creatures by landing on top of them. If an enemy touches the player's balloons, they will pop, causing the player to fall and lose a life.  There are several different stages, each with a different layout and various objects such as platforms, deadly spike pits, and fans that push the balloons around. The playfield also loops horizontally, and both the player and the enemies can leave one side of the screen and return through the other. When all enemies on a stage are defeated, the player is awarded a bonus for time remaining and moves on to the next stage.
