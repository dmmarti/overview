Recycle Design is a clone of the popular puzzle game Pipe Dream. The player controls a plumber who must connect two ends of a pipe before the water within overflows. The player can place pipe tiles on the screen toward this end, though each piece of pipe costs money which must also be collected on each stage. There are several other differences from the game's inspiration: there are no cross pieces, the only penalty for replacing a piece is the cost of the pipe, two different pipe pieces are held at any time, and there are also rocks which can be pushed around that playfield that will block the path and destroy pipes.
