John Adventure is a falling-block puzzle game cloned from Dr. Mario. Each stage presents the player with a bottle filled with dancing objects that must be destroyed. Pairs of pieces fall from the top of the bottle; line four of the same color in a row to cause them to disappear. Destroy all the target pieces to clear the stage, but reach the top of the bottle and it's game over! There are 20 stages and three play speeds available.
