Juggler is an action game where the player controls a magician who can create large floating bubbles. The object of the game is to keep the bubble bouncing long enough for it to grow larger, then pop it to cause pieces to fall on the enemies wandering each stage. Defeated enemies will release power-ups, but the magician must also be careful to keep away from the enemies, as one hit will knock him out.
