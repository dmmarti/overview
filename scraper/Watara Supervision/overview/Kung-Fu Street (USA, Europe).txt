Kung-Fu Street is a 1-on-1 martial arts fighting game very similar to Konami's Yie Ar Kung-Fu. The game plays similarly to the NES version of Konami's classic, offering punches and kicks at two different heights, plus flying jump kicks and wall bounces. A variety of different opponents must be defeated, including a ninja, a fencer, and a boxer, who each have their own fighting styles and techniques. If the player loses too many bouts, the game is over with no option to continue.
