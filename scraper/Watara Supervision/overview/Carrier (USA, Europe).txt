Carrier is a variant of the logic puzzle game Soko-Ban. The player controls a warehouse manager who must rearrange crates in a confined space, moving them all into the designated locations. It is possible to rewind a single move, as well as reset the puzzle or switch to any other puzzle in the set.  Stages are grouped in sets of ten, and the player must clear all ten stages to move on to the next stage. There are five stages, for a total of 50 puzzles. Many of the puzzles are taken directly from the Game Boy version of Soko-Ban, Boxxle.
