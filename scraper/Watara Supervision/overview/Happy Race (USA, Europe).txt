Happy Race is a top-down arcade driving game, strikingly similar to Namco's Rally-X sans the scrolling. Each stage consists of an assortment of passageways, obstacles, and flags; the goal of each stage is to collect all of the flags. Impeding the player are a pair of enemy buggies which will chase the player, but it is possible to use part of the car's fuel reserves to kick up dust clouds that will stun the enemies. There are several bonus flags on each stage, and also many bonus food items that will appear randomly and aware extra points. The game offers three difficulty settings.
