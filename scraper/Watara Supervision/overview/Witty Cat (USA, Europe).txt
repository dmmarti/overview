Witty Cat is a clone of the 1984 Namco coin-op Mappy. The game stars a mouse in a house full of cats, who must steal all the food in the house without getting caught. The house is divided into floors, which can be reached by using trampolines set up in vertical passages. Both the cats and the mouse can use the trampolines to move around, though the cats are only dangerous when the mouse is on solid ground. If the mouse is able to collect all the food, the stage is cleared and the player moves on to the next area.
