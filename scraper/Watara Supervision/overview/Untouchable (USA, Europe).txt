Untouchable is a bizarre side-scrolling shooter starring a young man who flies with with an autogyro backpack. Each stage sees the player fighting through waves of strange enemies, such as flying sea creatures or household objects, culminating in a boss fight at the end. Every so often, another man flies past, and reaching him allows the player to choose from one of six different power-ups, which change each time the man appears. Different shot power-ups are available including double and triple shots, as well as health refills and additional bombs.
