Climber is an action platform game starring a boy with a seemingly-endless supply of throwing knives. In addition to making excellent deadly projectiles, these knives will also stick into any surface they hit for a short time. While stuck, they can be used as platforms to reach further areas, or even to destroy certain blocks on the stage. The object of each stage is to reach a goal flag while avoiding the enemies and hazards through careful use of the player's knives.
