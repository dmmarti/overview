Super Block is a collection of three block puzzle games: Play Block is a clone of Flipull. The objective is to launch blocks at other blocks with matching patterns to clear them from the field. Clear enough blocks without running out of moves to move to the next stage. Fill Block is a clone of Quarth. Groups of blocks fall from the top of the screen, and the objective is to shoot additional blocks at them to create rectangles, causing the blocks to clear. If a block passes the line at the bottom of the screen, the game is over. Hit Block is a mixture of the two other games. Blocks of varying types fall from the top of the screen, and the player must launch a matching block at it to remove it from play. Launching the wrong type will add it to the stack. If a block passes the line at the bottom of the screen, the game is over.
