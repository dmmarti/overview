Police Bust is a dot-collecting maze game in the tradition of Pac-Man. The player controls a fugitive who is being chased by two police officers. He must collect all the dots strewn about a maze while avoiding capture. To aid in the escape, the player has access to barriers which will block the officers' path, as well as bombs which will stun them for a short time, but both items are in limited supply. Collect all the dots to move on to the next stage.
