Popo Team is an arcade-style action game similar to Anteater or Oil's Well. The player controls a curiously-sentient underground pump which must collect food and objects hidden within a variety of mazes. There are various objects that move around the maze to help or hinder the player: food items can be eaten for bonus points; creatures can be eaten with the head, but will kill the player if they touch the body; and bombs are harmless to the body, but will kill the head if eaten. The only controls are to extend the head in an open direction, and to quickly retract the tube to the surface.
