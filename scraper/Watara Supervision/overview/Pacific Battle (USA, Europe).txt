Pacific Battle is a turn-based naval tactics game. The player controls a fleet of ships and aircraft, including submarines, destroyers, and fighter jets, against a similarly-equipped enemy fleet on a tile-based map. Each unit type has different abilities and attacks; jets for example are quick and capable of long-range attack, but have little armor and are weak to gunfire, while submarines are invisible except to submarines, and are effective against surface ships. The goal of each map is to destroy the enemy fleet while keeping the player's fleet intact. It is only possible to play against the computer, and the game is saved with passwords.
