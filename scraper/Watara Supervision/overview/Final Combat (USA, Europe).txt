Final Combat is a top-view tank action game similar to Namco's Battle City. Each stage contains a large number of enemy units and other objects to destroy. The goal is to destroy the fortified enemy base in each area, though the base cannot be damaged until enough enemy units -- tanks and turrets -- are destroyed. When the OK is given, destroy the base to complete the stage. If the player's tank takes too much damage, it will be destroyed.
