Dancing Block is a simple arcade action game starring a sentient cube. This cube has a curious feature: a cannon on one side that can shoot pellets. However, as the cube moves by rotating onto different sides, the cannon will reorient whenever the cube moves. The goal of each stage is to collect all the fruit, while avoiding insects. Insects can be destroyed by the cannon... but only if it's firing in the right direction! Some stages feature power-ups that will allow the cube to fire in multiple directions simultaneously, or to shoot larger pellets that can hit multiple targets.  The NES release also includes a stage edit mode.
