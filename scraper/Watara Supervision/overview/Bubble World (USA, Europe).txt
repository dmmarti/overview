Bubble World is a simple arcade action game similar to Bubble Bobble. The player controls a small creature that can jump and shoot bubbles. The objective is to use the bubbles to capture and destroy all the enemies on each stage. Defeated enemies will often release items that may award bonus points, or even destroy all enemies on the screen. When all enemies have been defeated, the player moves on to the next stage. However, if the player touches an enemy or a flame bubble, a life is lost.
