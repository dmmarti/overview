Dream World is a side-scrolling platform game starring a girl with psychic powers. She begins with only a regular energy shot, but additional weapons can be found throughout the game. Curiously, using the girl's ESP powers does not consume energy; rather, switching between shot types does, meaning she can only switch a certain number of times on each stage. Different enemies are weak to different weapons, and each stage ends with a large boss that must be defeated to continue.
