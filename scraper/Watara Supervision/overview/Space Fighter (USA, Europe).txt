Space Fighter is an action shooting game starring a team of three robot soldiers, who must defend their cities from an enemy robot army. Each stage consists of a small scrolling top-down map filled with enemy robots. The player must shoot and destroy a certain number of enemies on each stage in order to move on to the next.  There are three different robots to choose from, each with their own different abilities. HUNT is the quickest, but can only shoot straight forward; DALE is the slowest but has a powerful spread shot; and OWEN is average pm speed, but can fire in four directions simultaneously. On each stage, there is also a base that can be used to switch robots and refill their energy.
