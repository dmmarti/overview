Galaxy Fighter is a vertically-scrolling space shooter. Many kinds of enemies appear in waves to attack the player, piloting an advanced fighter ship. When destroyed, enemies will sometimes drop power-up items, which include firepower upgrades and three different types of sub weapon: small homing missiles, large forward-firing missiles, and a rotating shield that damages nearby enemies. Every so often, a large boss enemy will appear, which must be destroyed in order to proceed. Similar to Toaplan's Truxton, there are no breaks between stages; the entire game scrolls continuously forward, only interrupted when the player's ship is destroyed.
