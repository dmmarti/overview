Hero Kid is a side-scrolling platform game starring a young man who must rescue his girlfriend. Each stage scrolls from left to right, and is filled with enemies and obstacles that must be overcome. Hero Kid's energy is continually depleting, and he must collect fruit to replenish it. The many enemies in his way are quite deadly, and will kill our hero in only one hit. However, it is also possible to gain the ability to throw hammers to destroy enemies by collecting floating hearts. Hero Kid only has three lives, and if he runs out, he is sent back to the beginning of the current area.
