Eagle Plan is an arcade-style flight sim game in the tradition of After Burner. Each mission tasks the player with destroying a certain number of enemies of specific types ? fighter planes, tanks, and warships ? and ends immediately once the conditions have been met. The player's craft has a gun with infinite ammo, as well as a limited number of missiles, tough certain enemies can only be destroyed with a specific type of weapon. Completing missions will earn money, which can be spent between missions to upgrade the player's craft, as well as replenish missiles and fuel. If the player runs out of fuel, which is also depleted from taking hits, the game is over.
