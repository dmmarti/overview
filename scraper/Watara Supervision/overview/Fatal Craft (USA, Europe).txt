Fatal Craft is a horizontally-scrolling shooter modeled after Konami's seminal arcade classic Gradius, right down to the enemy formations and power-up system. As in most any scrolling shoot-'em-up, the goal is to reach the end of each stage and destroy the boss, defeating enemies and collecting power-ups along the way. Some enemies drop capsules, which when collected will increment the power-up bar at the bottom of the screen; press the power-up button to collect the selected item and reset the bar. There are six types of upgrades available, including a speed-up, a shield, three types of weapon upgrades, and an Option unit that mimic's the ship's movement, providing another source of fire.
