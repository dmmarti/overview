Pacboy &amp; Mouse in an arcade action game similar to Pengo. A young boy's lady friend has been accosted by mice, and it's up to him to catch them. The player controls the boy in a maze made up of blocks, which can be kicked to make them slide. The goal is to use the blocks to crush all the mice on the stage, but if the player takes too long more mice will appear. It is also possible to kick the walls, which will stun any mice next to that wall. Touching a mouse directly will cause the player to lose a life. Once all the mice have been killed, the player moves on to the next stage.
