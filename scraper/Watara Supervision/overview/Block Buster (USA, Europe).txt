Block Buster is a simple Tetris clone for one player. The goal is to place pieces made up of four tiles in the playfield, organizing them into complete rows, which then disappear. As rows are cleared, the pace of the game increases, and the game ends if the stack reaches the top of the well.  The most notable difference from regular Tetris is that the game features a 12-by-16-block playfield, compared with the 10-by-20 field found in licensed Tetris titles. There is only one game mode (endless), though the starting level (speed) and amount of garbage can be chosen before starting the game.
