Delta Hero is an action maze game starring a young soldier trapped in a strange land. The goal of each stage is to collect enough bags of money and then reach the goal. The hero's only mode of defense against the strange creatures he encounters is a rather short-range gun. There are many items and enemies strewn around each stage, including food that will replenish the player's life, x-ray glasses that will reveal the many hidden items and pathways, and the money required to exit the stage. It is also possible to reveal hidden areas by shooting at them.
