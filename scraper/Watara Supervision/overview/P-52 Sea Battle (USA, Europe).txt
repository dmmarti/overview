P52 Sea Battle is an arcade naval battle game with four types of targets: Destroyer, Torpedo (Submarines), Aircraft (Carrier), and Cruiser. Choosing either a British, American, or USSR sub, the goal is to destroy all the given targets without running out of torpedoes or being sunk. There are four difficulty levels of each mode available, and clearing missions will earn points which can be used to purchase upgrades for the player's sub, including stronger armor and higher torpedo capacity.
