Honey Bee is a vertically-scrolling shooter that bears a striking similarity to Konami's TwinBee. The player controls a cute-looking ship with arms and legs, which can fire both at flying enemies and ground-based enemies. Destroyed ground enemies will drop hearts that give points, and it is also possible to shoot clouds to release items which will also give additional points. There are no power-ups to increase the ship's firepower. At the end of each stage, there is a boss that must be destroyed in order to continue.
