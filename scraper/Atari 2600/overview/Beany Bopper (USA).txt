In this game, you are Bopper.

The object is to stun then capture Beannies. You can also capture Bouncing Orange Eyeballs and various Falling Objects.

If an unstunned Beanny touches you, you lose a life. You don't need to stun the other items to capture them but doing so makes them slow down.

You get a bonus Bopper by shooting four Beannies in a row without losing a Bopper.

There are two game options, one where the Beannies bounce off the walls on screen, the other where they pass through.
