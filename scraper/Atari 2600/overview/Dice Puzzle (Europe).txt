This dice puzzle has 16 squares of random numbers between 1-6. The object is to change all the numbers to 6 in the shortest amount of time, using the fewest number of turns. When the power is turned on, each square will have the number 1. After pushing the reset button, all the dice change to random numbers. (The game is guaranteed to be solvable every time.) There is a small square that moves outside of the left sides and over the top by using the joy stick. When the fire button is pushed, all the numbers in the row next to the square increase by one. The numbers can also be changed diagonally. Every 5 minutes a warning will sound, up to a maximum time limit of 60 minutes. When all the dice are changed to 6, the game will automatically end displaying time used and numbers of turns taken.
