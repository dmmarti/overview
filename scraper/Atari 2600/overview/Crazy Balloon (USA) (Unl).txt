In this game, you try to get your balloon from one point to the end of a spike-walled maze, without popping it. Your balloon constantly sways back and forth so you must be cautious. You cannot take all day because you are timed, as well. To make matters worse, in the later levels, you face moving spikes, Hurricane Man, who will try to blow you into a wall, and magnets that try to drag you into the wall. There are sixteen levels total.
