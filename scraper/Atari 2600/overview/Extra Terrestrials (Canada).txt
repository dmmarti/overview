Extra Terrestrials was originally programmed in 1984 by Herman Quast and Silk Screen Games in Brantford Ontario, Canada. Unfortunately, by the time the game was finished, the video game market had crashed and since Silk Screen Games had no distributor, only sold a few hundred copies at most to local stores and door to door. Because this game wasn't officially licensed, it never popped up on any list until Silk Screen Games founder Peter Banting found a copy and donated it to the Personal Computer Museum.
