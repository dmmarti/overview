Space Jockey is a side scrolling shooter for one player. Your goal is to earn as many points as possible by having your attack saucer shoot down the varied enemies which fly by. Tanks, jet planes, prop planes, helicopters, weather balloons, and even some trees and houses will all pass by on the screen and try to destroy your saucer. You need to make sure you avoid colliding with the various enemies and their fire or one of your three saucers will be lost. Extra saucers are awarded for each 1000 points earned. Several game variations are included which control the game difficulty, the movement abilities of the enemies, and the movement abilities of your saucer.
