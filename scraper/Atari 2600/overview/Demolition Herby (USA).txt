Wham! Bam! Watch out, ma'am!

You are Demolition Herby and you're out to own the roads. You must drive around a square section to black it out; the object being to black out all sections. There are only three things in your way: the chase cars. When they drive over a line you have turned red, it turns white again. To make matters worse, they will try to ram you off the track. The good news is if you ram them from behind, you run them off the track for a few seconds. If you need a burst of speed, shift into overdrive by pressing your button however, there is a drawback, as I will explain. Something else to keep an eye on is your fuel. You burn fuel as your drive and burn faster when you use overdrive. Each time you black out an section, you gain points and fuel. If you black out two sections at once, you gain more fuel. You will lose a life if you run out of fuel or are knocked off the track. If you lose three lives, the game is over.
