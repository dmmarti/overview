Taz (the Tasmanian Devil) is going on a feeding frenzy!! Hamburgers, root beers, ice cream cones, tomatoes, apple cores, and other foods will all fly by on the screen, and Taz needs to eat as many of these as he can to earn points. But mixed in with the tasty foods are sticks of dynamite! If Taz accidentally eats the dynamite, he will explode and lose a life. As Taz eats food, the levels will become faster and faster and feature more dynamite mixed in with the food.
