In Phaser Patrol you are the pilot of an interstellar spaceship on a mission to defend the Human Federation from the deadly Dracon armada. Gameplay is similar to Star Raiders. You begin with a view of the sector map, and need to warp to a sector where the Dracon are located. Once you've reached your destination, the game switches to a first person point of view where you need to destroy all enemy fighters located in the sector. Once the sector is cleared, you can return to the sector map and warp to a new location. The mission is successful when all sectors containing enemy fighters have been cleared. Your ship has a limited amount of energy; energy is depleted by warping to new sectors, or by taking damage from enemy fighters. If your energy runs out the game is over, however you can recharge your ship by visiting one of the friendly starbases that are located throughout the galaxy (visiting a starbase will also repair any equipment that has been damaged, such as the photon torpedoes or sector scanner).  The game is timed, and the faster you can complete your mission the better your ranking at the end will be!
