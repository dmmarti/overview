Subterranea is a side scrolling shooter. Your goal is to locate treasure crystals within the Hexuplex Caves. Controlling your cave ranger, you need to blast the various types of aerobots which are guarding the cave. When all of the bots on a cave level have been destroyed, a passageway opens allowing you to travel deeper into the caverns. When you reach the last level of the cavern, you can collect the treasure crystal and be transported to the next (more challenging) set of caves and try for another crystal. In addition to the deadly aerobots, be sure not to crash into cave walls; these will drain your energy rapidly, especially if you hit one of the skulls. When all of your reserve cave rangers have crashed, the game is over. As you progress through the caves, they become narrower and the enemies move faster. Standard and advanced skill levels are available.
