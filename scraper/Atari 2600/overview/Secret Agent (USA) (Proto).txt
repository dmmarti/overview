They've given you a number and taken away your name - "Secret Agent Man" by Johnny Rivers

You, the Secret Agent, must catch the falling agent items, like U.S. documents, money cases and money bags, while avoiding the undesirables, like bugs, grenades and guns. After a time, a tone will sound. This is when the boats on the water below you will stop moving and you need to get above them and 'make the hand off'. Be careful, though, for although the boats stopped moving, the falling items have not. In two-player games, the players alternate.
