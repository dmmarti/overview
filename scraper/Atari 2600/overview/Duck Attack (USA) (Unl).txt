For years, the elusive mad scientist Dr. Enrique MacGuffin has been genetically engineering giant, radioactive mutant ducks. These ducks ar said to lay eggs of pure plutonium, which, the authorities say, Dr. MacGuffin is planning to use to create a doomsday device.

The authorities have finally located his secret lair, and have asked you, a renowned robotics inventor, to explore the lair and retieve the radioactive eggs before MacGuffin can use them in his doomsday device.

Naturally, you don't want to go in there yourself, since the place is teeming with radioactivity, but you know just who to send: your brand new robotic creation who is immune for the effects of the deadly radiation.

With your trusty robot's help, you can explore the lair and collect the plutonium eggs - but watch out: the mutant ducks are in there too, and they would love nothing more than to eat a metallic intruder. And no doubt Dr. MacGuffin had filled his many rooms with other deadly creatures and mechanical booby traps.
