Donald has entered the Duckburg boat race and has taken to the sea with his speedboat. The objective is to steer the boat away from the obstacles along the way to the finish line and do so as fast as possible without losing pressure on the throttle. The game takes place across multiple screens which each presents its own obstacle patterns and challenges.
