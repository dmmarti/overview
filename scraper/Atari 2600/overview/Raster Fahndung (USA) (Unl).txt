You are presented with a screen full of squares, thirty-two squares wide by twenty squares high. The object of the game is to find a particular set of squares that measure six by six squares. This sounds simple but you are timed. You can view the pattern you need by pressing fire but don't stay long as this makes the timer speed up to twice as fast while you are in that screen. In a two player game, the first player to find the correct pattern collects one point. The game ends when the timer runs out or, in two player, one player reaches nine points.

You start with ninety seconds. If you select the easy difficulty, the second puzzle with have five less seconds. Time decreases per screen until you reach twenty seconds, the lowest time. On the hard setting, you have to clear as many boards as you can in ninety seconds, total.
