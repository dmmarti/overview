Chopper Command is a side scrolling shooter. As the pilot of a helicopter gunship, your mission is to protect the convoy of trucks which is travelling at the bottom of the screen. Each wave consists of numerous enemy choppers and jets which are trying to destroy you and the convoy. When all enemies in the current wave are destroyed, you can move on to the next, more difficult wave. To help out, a long range scanner is located at the bottom of the screen which can locate trucks in the convoy as well as enemy aircraft. Good luck, the ground troops are counting on you!
