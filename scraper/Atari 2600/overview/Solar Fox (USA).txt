In Solar Fox, your mission is to guide a space ship though a solar cell matrix and collect as many of the solar cells as you can. When all of the cells in a matrix have been collected, you move on to the next round. Each matrix is guarded by two sentinels trying to stop you. The sentinels wander around the perimeter of the matrix, and will shoot fireballs at your spaceship which can destroy it. You are unarmed, so your only defense against the fireballs is to avoid them. To help you out a bit, your ship is capable of flying at two different speeds. Each round begins with a 'skip-a-rack' timer; if you collect all solar cells before this timer runs out, you will earn bonus points and skip ahead a level. The game ends when you have lost all of your space ships.
