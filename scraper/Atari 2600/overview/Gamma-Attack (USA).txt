You are the commander of the only Gamma ship in this stellar field.  The Vegan war fleet has taken control of your Gamma outpost planet and is defending it with Vegan laser pulse tanks.  This planet is the only inhabitable planet in this star system, and you must stay there and fight the Vegans as long as you can.

Move your ship across the surface of the planet and destroy Vegan tanks that you encounter.  Destroying all tanks advances the player to the next level.  Each laser pulse that your Gamma ship receives reduces your hovering altitude.  When your ship crashes, the "Gammy" appears and your game is over.
