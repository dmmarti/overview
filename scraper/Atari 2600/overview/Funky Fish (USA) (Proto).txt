You are the Funky Fish. The object of the game, here, is to attack the sea creatures who are guarding the monster. You shoot them with your bubbles and they turn into fruit. You must then eat the fruit to maintain energy. If you take to long getting the fruit, it will turn back into the sea creature it was before and continue to chase you. If you are touched by a sea creature or you touch the monster, you lose a life and become bones, sinking to the sea bottom. If you lose all your lives, the game is over.
