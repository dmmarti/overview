SwordQuest: FireWorld, the second game in the SwordQuest series, was insanely identical to the first game, EarthWorld. In this installment you will find yourself walking from room to room, finding and dropping items, beating the action stages in order to find more items, seeing the odd set of numbers flash at you if you get the right combination of items in the right rooms. 

The sets of numbers, for instance 16-4, were actually a combination of a page number and a panel number in the comic book that came with the game. On the page indicated by the game, you would find a word hidden somewhere in the numbered panel. When all the correct words were found, you could send them to Atari in hopes of winning the SwordQuest contest that this game was designed for.
