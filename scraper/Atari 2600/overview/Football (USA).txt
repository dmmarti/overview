Football is a football game for two players. The game is played from a top down point of view of the field and features two skill levels and three game variations. Using the joystick you can choose from one of five different offensive or defensive plays. In the first game variation, after selecting a play you then control the players on the field. In the second game, you have the option of controller your players after a play is selected or allowing the computer to control the players. The third game has the computer controlling the players at all times and you only need to select the plays you wish it to execute  and indicate when you wish to punt or pass the ball. In all of the game variations the timer begins at 5 minutes, and is active only during plays. Of course, the team with the most points when the timer runs out wins!
