Basketball allows you to play a game of one-on-one against either the computer or another player. The court is viewed from the side with a basket at each end of the screen.  Using the joystick you can move your player around the court, dribble/shoot the ball, and attempt to block your opponent. The game is played in two 4 minute halves, and the player who scores the most points wins. There are two different skill levels available which can be set individually for each player.
