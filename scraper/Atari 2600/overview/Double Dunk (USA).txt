Play a fast paced two-on-two game of half court basket ball. Using only half the court means you need to be more careful not to lose the ball, or to miss easy shots when an opponent is close. With multiple game styles and possible plays each game is something different. 3-point shots and fouls can be toggled on or off. Also, you have the option to change the colors of each team's uniforms.
