Star Fox is a horizontally scrolling action game. You control a starship on a foreign planet with the mission of collecting valuable crystals. The crystals will be located on the planets surface or somewhere in the atmosphere. When you locate a crystal, you need to fly down into the planets atmosphere to retrieve it (be careful, your ship has limited maneuverability while in the atmosphere). Of course, your mission won't be easy; guarding the planet are numerous enemy fighters. To protect yourself from enemy attacks your ship is equipped with lasers. The game ends when all of your ships have been destroyed. Good luck!
