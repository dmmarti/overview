Sorcerer is an arcade action game which takes place long ago when wizards and sorcerers ruled the earth. The evil wizards have decided to attempt to conquer the earth, and have sent numerous waves of creatures to stop all of the good sorcerers. Your goal is to destroy the various creatures! On the beginning screen of the game, there is a flying platform: you need to jump and catch this platform which will allow you to fly anywhere on the screen. Next you will need to fight screen after screen of dangerous creatures by firing an energy charge at them. After you have successfully destroyed the creatures on the current screen, a treasure will be left behind which can be collected for bonus points and then you can move on to the next screen. From time to time, you may also encounter a cloud with deadly lightning bolts that you must avoid! The longer you survive, the faster the enemies become. Two levels of difficulty as well as a practice mode are available.
