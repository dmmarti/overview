Who knew? You thought you could play cards better than that when drunk. But now you've done it. You lost King Roland the Insane's black rose in a card game with the Dark Mage so you've been banished. The only way you can go home again is to find and return that black rose.

Use a joystick to take items, talk to characters and go places to find the king's rose.
Inspired by text-based games like those released by Infocom, you do not type here. Instead, you move the joystick to change the selection at the bottom of the screen then press the button to select.
