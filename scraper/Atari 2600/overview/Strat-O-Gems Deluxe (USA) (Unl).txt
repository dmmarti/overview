Strat O Gems Deluxe is a falling jewels game similar to Columns, Acid Drop, Jewel Master, Paris Hilton's Diamond Quest, among others.

Three colored gems fall from the top of the screen in a vertical pattern. You must place the gems on the growing pile so that there are three or more of the same color in a row horizontally, vertically or diagonally. When you get three or more of the same color in a row, they will disappear from the screen. If you get a combo of three or more levels, you get a high bonus. A combo is when gems disappear and cause more gems to line up and disappear. Occasionally, three gems that change colors and have colored horizontal bars across them will appear. These will create a row with whatever gems you place them on. At the end of the level, a flashing white gem with a horizontal white bar will drop down. This will remove whatever color gem it is placed on, regardless of where they are on the screen. If the gems pile up to the line at the top of the screen, the game is over.
