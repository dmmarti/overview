You're the pilot of an F-14 assault jet, assigned to the dangerous mission of taking out an enemy bridge at the top of a heavily guarded river. In River Raid II, the gameplay is similar to the original River Raid, but with a few additions. For each mission you start out on an aircraft carrier. After a successful takeoff, you need to get past enemy forces located over the ocean which guard the entrance to the river. Make sure to collect plenty of fuel from the refueling jets, since once you reach the river fuel will become scarce! Next you will have to make your way up the treacherous river channel until you finally reach, and hopefully destroy, the bridge. But the level isn't over yet, for now  you have to return to the aircraft carrier and land safely. After completing all of this, you move on to the next, more challenging level. In addition to the expanded levels, another change in River Raid II is the ability to control the altitude of your plane. You can fly high above everything, or fly low into the channel to take out enemy tanks and barges.
