Okie Dokie is a puzzle game where you are to clear the screen of all the items. You do this by clicking the item to 'flip' it to off. But things are not as easy as that. When you flip an item, the spaces above, below, to the left and to the right of it are reversed. If the items in those spaces were on, they turn off but if the items in those spaces were off, they turn back on. Try to clear the screen in the fewest moves.
