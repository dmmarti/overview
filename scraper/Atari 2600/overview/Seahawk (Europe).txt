A fast-paced shooting game that has you in control of a fighter jet named the Sea Hawk, blasting away at enemy helicopters and ships. Two weapons are at your command: Missiles and bombs. If an enemy missile hits your plane, your pilot will eject and use his parachute. Guide him to a friendly ship and a life won't be lost. There are no levels to complete or bosses to beat, and gameplay can continue for as long as you can last.
