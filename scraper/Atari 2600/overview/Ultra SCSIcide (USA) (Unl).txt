This is an improved version of SCSIcide.

The improvements are:

1. Support for joysticks
2. Fixed the flicker that occurred at the beginning of each level.
3. Changed background and data bit colors to make bits easier to distinguish.
4. Reduced track size from ten to eight bits.
5. Speed increase per level has been changed so that only two random data bits increase in speed each level.
6. Modified sound and scoring routines to account for the game going for longer and to higher levels.
7. Changed the title screen text and added logos for Grand Idea Studio and Pixels Past.
8. Added PAL support.
9. New label and manual cover
