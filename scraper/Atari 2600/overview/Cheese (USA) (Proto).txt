Your kingdom has been taken over by dragons and it's your duty as the Prince to get all the king's treasures back from those nasty dragons. Dragonfire is a simple game consisting of two screens. First you must traverse the drawbridge to the castle while dodging fireballs being shot towards you by the dragon. You must use quick reflexes to duck under the high ones and jump over the low ones. If you make it to the other side you'll find yourself in a a room full of treasures as well as a rather large dragon at the bottom of the screen. You must then gather the treasure as quickly as possible without falling victim to the dragon's fireballs. When you collect all the treasures an exit appears and you start over again, but with a higher difficulty than before. Get hit a total of seven times and the game is over.
