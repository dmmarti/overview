Confrontation is a strange strategy game which was never commercially released, but was available directly from Answer for a short time.  Only people who saw it on display at the 1983 CES show would have know about it and ordered it so while it's not technically a prototype, it's close enough.  Since Confrontation uses a programming trick to display so many objects on the screen at once, screenshots will only show one players pieces at a time.
