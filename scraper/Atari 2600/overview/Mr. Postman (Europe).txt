It's a long way to the city of silence, well, not so long since Mr. Postman has only three stages.At the first level your goal is to climb on the back of the bird that is trying to reach you so that the player must dodge your shot, climb the big tree on the edge of the screen to reach the vine that is just above the bird and find a way to jump on the enemy.In the second phase the player is mounted on the bird in a storm, avoid the rays while shooting the hailstones falling toward him. To follow the next Nivelo player must also defeat the birds that are above the clouds.The third and final level is set in the city of silence, here the player must get to the house where it should deliver the mail without colliding with any of the walls. Unlike other levels, this player has no enemy, should just stay focused not to touch anything.After finishing the third stage the game will start from the beginning of the first level.
