You are trapped in a maze and have a limited amount of time to locate the exit. You can find and use dynamite to open additional doors in some mazes. There are sixteen mazes total. The game's orientation requires you to turn your TV 90�, lay on your right side, use mirrors so the screen looks like it is 90� turned or create a tabletop monitor.
