The year is 2552. Planet Earth still exists, but overpopulation has forces many of her former residents to colonize other worlds.

After contact with an outer colony was lost, a battlegroup was sent to investigate and was almost completely destroyed; only one badly damaged ship returned to tell of a seemingly unstoppable alien warship that had effortlessly annihilated their forces.

This was humankind's first encounter with a group of aliens they eventually came to know as the Covenant, a collective of alien races bent on wiping out humanity.

A desperate plan is set in motion: board a Covenant vessel and learn the location of the Covenant home world. but before the mission begins, Covenant forces strike and annihilate the attack force. The Covenant are now on Earth's doorstep. One ship escapes and makes a blind jump into deep space, hoping to lead the Covenant away from Earth.

The ship crashed on halo - an artificial ring world this is actually a weapon capable of destroying all life in the galaxy should it fall into the hands of the Covenant.

You are the Master Chief - all that remains of a classified military project to build a series of genetically enhanced super-soldiers. You are hunamity's last and best hope against the  Covenant - but you're woefully out-matched, and survival is not guaranteed.

Can you battle your way through the massive world that is halo, defeat the Covenant, and save humanity?
