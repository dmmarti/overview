The year is 2947. Earth is being invaded by the evil K�caj clan from the Yenrut galaxy. You are Galactic Commander Frank Drexor. The United States Space Guard has commissioned you with the task of defending the most important sector of the galaxy from the invaders. K�caj technology is much more advanced than the technology of Earth. Some of the ships have tractor beams. Others are equipped with subspace energy disruptors. These disruptors create energy barriers that will actually cause the shots from your cannons to reflect back at you! If your mission is a failure, the K�caj will gain control of this vital sector of space, allowing them to maneuver their troops and equipment much more efficiently and gain a larger foothold in the battle for the planet. This would certainly spell disaster for the citizens of Earth. Their fate is in your hands! 

You have a gun on the top of the screen and one on the bottom, each of which travel left or right. To switch between weapons, just press the joystick up or down. You must be careful when you fire because if you shoot your own gun, you will lose a life. There is a yellow spaceship that starts on the row next to the middle row and moves across the screen. Each time it reaches the screen, it moves one row closer to one side. If it gets to your gun, you lose as life. Later in the game, barriers appear in the playing field. You must be careful when these are there as they will reflect your gun's shots back, losing you a life if they hit. In the center, at times, there is a UFO colored either red, blue or green. The red is worth one-hundred points, the blue grants and extra life and the green resets the difficulty to level one without removing the points. Play simply continues until you lose all your lives.
