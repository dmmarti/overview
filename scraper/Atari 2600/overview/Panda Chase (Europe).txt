Panda Chase is a strange game where, controlling a panda, you should go through the various levels of the game looking for bamboos to recover your energy that is lost every second.When the game begins, the panda will be in an open area with many places to explore. Once you get somewhere, you will appear in a new environment, is a cave, forest or open field. Your goal will go through the obstacles and dodge the enemies to get your bamboo.To catch a bamboo player will recover your energy and get points. If you run out points or lose your three lives, the game will end.Apparently Panda Chase is not a prototype, the game was finished and sold, which does not justify the graphics and several bugs that happen in the game.
