An alien crashed on Earth and to get back to his planet he must find the four pieces of his spacecraft. Go into the several rooms and press the button. Hopefully, a piece of the ship will show on a corner of the screen. Pick it up and repeat the procedure until you can back home. Beware of the guardians, though, as they would follow you to trap you.
