The mad bomber is on the loose! As he races back and forth at the top  of the screen, you need to catch the bombs he drops in buckets of water. One point is earned for each bomb caught, but miss one of the bombs, and Kaboom! As the levels progress, the mad bomber will move faster and faster and drop more and more bombs. You start the game with three buckets, and lose one each time a bomb is missed. The game ends when all of your water buckets are gone.
