On out last adventure many years ago, you slew the Evil Magician's three dragons and reclaimed the Enchanted Chalice, bringing peace to your kingdom. Now the Evil Magician has returned and stolen the chalice back, plunging your Kingdon into darkness. With his dragons dead, the Evil Magician and his apprentice now personally guard the chalice. Rumor has it that the Evil Magician has created a new creature even more powerful than his previous dragons to guard the chalice as a last defense.

As in your last adventure, the object of the game is to rescue the Enchanted Chalice and place it inside the Golden Castlewhere it belongs. Once again, this will not be an easy quest. the Evil Magician (red wizard) has the ability to cast fireballs. His apprentice (white wizard) has not yet learned this skill, but his touch is fatal.
