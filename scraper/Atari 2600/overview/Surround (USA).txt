Surround is an arcade action game for two players. Each player controls a constantly moving wall; your goal is to trap your opponent forcing him to crash into a wall. Each time your opponent crashes, you earn a point. The first player to reach ten points wins. In addition to this mode, a video graffiti mode is also included which lets you draw on the screen. Several game variations are included which optionally allow diagonal movement, allow you to wrap around the screen, and control the game speed.
