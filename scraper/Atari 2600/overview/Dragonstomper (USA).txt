Long ago, a Druid magician created an amulet of great power that could subdue a dragon. Heading to the dragon's lair, the Druid accidentally dropped the amulet and it fell deep into its lair. Over time, the amulet imbued the dragon with cunning and power so that it began to spread treachery and evil about the peaceful Kingdom. The player's quest begins with the king summoning the player to defeat the dragon once and for all. Taking up the call to arms, the player begins by gathering their strength and fighting creatures in the enchanted countryside to build up enough power to become a Dragonstomper. When finally ready, the player moves on to an oppressed village near the dragon's lair in order to recruit soldiers, buy magical scrolls, and acquire medicines and elixirs needed to face the dragon in its lair. With all of his skills, training, equipment and soldiers, the Dragonstomper descends into the dragon's lair for a final combat to bring peace to the Kingdom.
