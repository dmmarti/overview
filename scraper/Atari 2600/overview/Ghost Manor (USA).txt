Your friend is trapped inside Ghost Manor! There are five different screens you need to get past before you can rescue your friend from the top floor of the manor. The game begins in the graveyard outside the manor; here you play tag with a friendly rainbow ghost or skeleton which will supply you with spears you can fire at enemies. In the second screen, you approach the guarded entrance of the manor. Using the spears you collected, you need to shoot all of the enemies blocking the entrance. The third and fourth screens take place inside the manor; each floor has a set of stairs as well as several treasures and crosses which can be collected. There is a moving wall on each of these floors which is deadly to the touch, so be careful! The final screen is the top floor of the manor where your friend is being held captive. Dracula guards this floor, and using the crosses you collected earlier you need to repel him into a prison and free your friend. To make the game more challenging, there is a time limit; you must complete all of this in four minutes or less! You can play the game as either a boy or a girl, and four different skill levels are available.
