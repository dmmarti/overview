The player controls a boy named Bobby who has to pass through seven screens, jump over animals like butterflies, ducks and other hazards. The game play resembles Pitfall!, a game released by Activision. At the end of the game all the player has to do is get Bobby into the house, and there the next level will show. Hitting reset and select change the style of flowers that show at the bottom of the screen.
