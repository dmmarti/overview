To get to the place of hunting, James must go through a route of 30 km full of obstacles and dangers.  As he passed the first screen, the player will pick up your gun and you will help you hit the animals that run in your direction.  After passing the 30 km from the hunting area, a new level will begin, where the player must again go through the obstacles to get to the animals. Over phase the game increases its difficulty.
