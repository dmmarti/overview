This is the game Warring Worms with several improvements. 

These include:

1. Tank Mode: in this mode, you do not leave a trail behind you when you move.

2. Solid Arena Mode: the obstacles in the arena cannot be destroyed by your cannon, only worm trails or heads.

3. Unbreakable Mode: your cannon only hurts the opponent's head. Nothing else is affected by it.

4. First To: this allows you to set the ending score so game length will be manageable.

5. Sudden Death Mode: in this mode, if any player gets two points ahead of the other, they win.

6. Select Game/Random Game: selecting Random game changes most game options randomly before each round.
