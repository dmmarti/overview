This is an improved version of Skeleton with the following new features:

1. A life and a kill counter on screen
2. A new Undead Locator to help track skeletons
3. A selectable option to only have five skeletons per maze instead of ten
4. A selectable option to start with only forty-nine health instead of ninety-nine and your shots only do half the damage.
5. An option to turn the Undead Locator on or off during game play
6. An option to choose to have the skeleton speed reset only at the start of a level
7. An option to return the skeleton's touch to instant death like in the original version.
