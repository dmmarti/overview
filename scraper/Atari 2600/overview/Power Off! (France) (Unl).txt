You are Brian Mareck. Your father created a super computer to help mankind but when it was switched on, something went wrong. You must deactivate the computer, but beware of the robots that have been reprogrammed to protect the computer at all costs. You must run and climb ladders to get to the 'power pills' and deactivate them. Avoid the robots as they will kill you. Once you have deactivated all the 'power pills' in that part of the lab (level), it is off to the next.
