This is a variation on the classic game Pong that adds flapping wings to your paddles. You must press your flap button repeatedly to go up and stop pressing to come down.

In the Atari 2600 version, there is also a pterodactyl on the screen the interferes with the ball or your paddle. The Atari 2600 version also includes a variation referred to as 'Poorlords' that adds a wall of bricks behind the players that must be busted through to score points.
