Nighttime in the frigid North Atlantic. Home of the Great White Shark. The Giant Squid. And hundreds of deadly, killer subs. Enemy submarines, that have embarked on a suicide mission that will deal a death blow to our fleet. And only the Captain of one destroyer can stop them now. With an eye on the radar screen and a finger on the trigger, you frantically steam back and forth across the surface, laying down one depth charge pattern after another. The ping of the sonar fills the night. The sound of exploding depth charges fills the ocean, as you pick off one submarine after another, hoping you've picked the perfect moment to sink the glowing nuclear subs.
