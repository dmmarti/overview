You endlessly shoot at debris and enemy ships and your score even decreases with missed targets. If a ship isn't shot and passes by, you explode in an extremely lame way. When you lose a life and restart, the game usually glitches and turns everything on the screen into a ship and you can't shoot everything and will lose two or three lives at once. The game play never increases in difficulty fast enough and you gain extra lives too fast but you can lose several due to flaws in the game like I mentioned before so this game is pretty unbalanced and plays about as poorly as it can get
