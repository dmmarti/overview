Snoopy takes to the skies on his Sopwith Camel doghouse to bring down the Red Baron.  A Defender-esque shooter geared more towards the young gamer, it is up to Snoopy to blow his foe out of the sky while catching the various treats (bones, hamburgers, root beer) that the Red Baron drops to gain bonus points.  Shoot down the Red Baron enough times, and be rewarded a medal.  Fail, and the Red Baron lives to fight another day.
