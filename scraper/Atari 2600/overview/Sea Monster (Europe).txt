In Sea Monster you control a ship out in the open seas. Beneath the waves are numerous sea monsters, many of which are attacking your ship! Your ship is located at the top of the screen, and your goal is to earn as many points as possible by shooting the various sea monsters that swim by. The deeper in the ocean the monster is, the more points it is worth. The game ends when all of your ships have been destroyed. Gameplay is for one or two players, and several game variations are available which control the speed and difficulty.
