This is a game similar to the Poker Solitaire found in Casino/Poker Plus. The object is to place twenty-five cards out of fifty-two on a grid five rows wide and five rows deep to form the best poker hands you can, horizontally, vertically and diagonally. The better your poker hands, the more points you get.

1. For each row with one pair: one point
2. For each row with  two pairs: three points
3. For each row with three of a kind: six points
4. For each row with a straight: twelve points
5. For each row with a flush: five points
6. For each row with a full house: ten points
