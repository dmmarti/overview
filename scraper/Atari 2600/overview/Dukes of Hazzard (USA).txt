Dukes of Hazzard  was a prototype that was never released, The game starts by default on level 0, but you can choose to start on any level from 0 to 10.  The object of the game is pretty straightforward: you must traverse up through Hazzard county (a layout of nearly 11 screens) and reach the jail before Boss Hog catches up with Daisy, as shown at the top of the screen.  Pushing UP applies the gas and LEFT/RIGHT controls the steering. Rosco (in his police car) chases you throughout the county in an effort to stop you (you’ll hear his police siren when he’s near); if caught, you’ll lose one of your 4 cars, and start over at the bottom of the course.  Nails can be found along the way and used to temporarily disable Rosco’s cruiser.  However, they can damage your car’s tires just as easily, so you must drive very slowly over them to safely pick them up.  Pressing the FIRE button drops the nails.  You have another advantage in that your car can move diagonally (Rosco’s can’t).  A good tip for the higher levels is to keep his car in sight behind you while moving up.  If he scrolls off the screen, he’ll possibly reappear right in front of you!
