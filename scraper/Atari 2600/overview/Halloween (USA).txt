Protect the children and fight for your life "the night HE came home!"

Babysitting a group of children in a large two-story house, players assume the role of Laurie Strode as psychopath Michael Myers has escaped from the mental institution and has come back for revenge.  Players must guide the children to safe rooms while avoiding Michael Myers and his knife.

The house is large and full of dangerous blackouts and dead-ends within its sixteen rooms.  However, Laurie is not completely defenseless.  There is a knife that can be found to protect herself once the familiar theme music begins to play and killer remains in pursuit.  

Players will advance to the next level by either stabbing Michael Myers twice, or rescuing five of the children.
