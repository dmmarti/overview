Ernie's ship has run out of fuel and it is up to you to help him.

Use the buttons of the controller to move your ship left or right and beam letters to the correct slots on Ernie's ship. Once all the letters are in place, Ernie can fly away.

This game helps kids learn to recognize letters and match capital letters to lower case and recognize easy-to-confuse letters.

The game manual also contained a read-aloud story.

For ages 3-7.
