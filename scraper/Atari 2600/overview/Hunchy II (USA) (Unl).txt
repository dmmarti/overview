A 4k game (three more than its predecessor!), Hunchy 2 boasts more bells and whistles (admittedly more bells than whistles) than the game it is nominally a successor to, the Atari 2600's Hunchy, and though superficially drawing thematic inspiration from Hunchback II: Quasimodo's Revenge, its basic gameplay has been more directly derived from Chuckie Egg and Miner 2049er.

The gameplay in question involves a progression through 14 levels 
of platforming to impress Esmeralda, climbing up and down ladders to gather bells while avoiding guards and a regular stream of missiles being fired in from the sides.
