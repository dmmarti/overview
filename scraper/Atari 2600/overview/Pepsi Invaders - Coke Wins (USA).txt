Coca-Cola asked Atari to create a game cartridge for Coca-Cola's Atlanta employees. So Atari went and altered Space Invaders. In this hack, the first five aliens are replaced by the letters P-E-P-S-I. The space ship that moves across the top has also been redesigned as the Pepsi red-white-and-blue circle logo. You have unlimited lives but only a three minute time limit to play. After the time runs out the game will flash with the words "Coke wins" at the top.
