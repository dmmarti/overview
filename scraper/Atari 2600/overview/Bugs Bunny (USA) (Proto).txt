Bugs has stolen carrots from Elmer. Elmer's hound found that scwewy wabbit and dug him up. Now, Bugs need to dive back into his rabbit hole to avoid getting a cotton-tail full of buckshot.

You have three levels on the screen. You must select a level then press your button to steal the carrot. Once the carrot is stolen, Elmer's hound will dig where the carrot was, forcing you to come above ground. You must then make your way to the hole the hound dug and dive in to safety before Elmer blasts you. Once you have cleared all three levels, it is on to the next screen. If Elmer shoots you three times, the game is over. In a two player game, one player is Bugs, the other is Elmer.
