Ow! Your head hurts. Where are you? What happened? It is dark but you here a beeping and find a PDA at your feet. You note there is a dot on the PDA screen. When you take a step, it move, too.  Interesting. There is a button and stick. When you press the button, you see the walls of part of a maze. Moving the stick lets you look at more maze. All very well but you note that there is a timer counting down. You have a suspicion that when it ends, so will you.

You begin in a maze on the lower left corner. You can move anywhere but cannot pass through walls or the outer perimeter. If you press fire, you can see a spotlighted area of the maze and by holding down the button, you can move the joystick around to see more maze. You must find the exit before the timer, which begins counting down as soon as you move, reaches zero. In the maze, there is a box that will give you more time. If the timer reaches zero, game is over. Once you exit the maze, you get any remaining time as your score. If you never used the spotlight in that maze, your score is doubled.
