Warring Worms is described by its author as "an advanced version of the classic Atari game Surround." Two worms in an arena move forward at all times. You can change direction but never stop. Each worm leaves a wall behind him. You must get your opponent to crash into a wall or barrier but not do so your self. You can also, depending on how your Atari 2600 is set up, shoot the opposing worm's head. The first player to reach ninety-nine points wins.
