This is a version of the Qb game with cleaned up graphics and more color. It was released in a wooden cigar box with a magnetic latch painted to match the Qb screen colors with rare Tasmanian wood squares on top, set in a pattern like in the game. It is also signed by the author Andrew Davie. Inside the box is a new cartridge of the game sporting a new label that was the winning design in a Qb label contest. The ROM has a serial number encoded in it and the game is limited to 100 copies. There is a manual detailing the history of the game and a disc with the source code and about thirty screen shots of the game in development.
