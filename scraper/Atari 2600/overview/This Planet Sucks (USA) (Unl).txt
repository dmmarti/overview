This Planet Sucks! is based on the Taito coin-op game Lunar Rescue. You begin with your lander in the mothership at the top of the screen. You exit by pressing the button. You must guide your lander around asteroids to land on one of three platforms at the bottom. Be sure to press the button so you fire the retrorockets so you do not come in at too high a speed and destroy the lander. Also, take care not to hit the survivor you are going to try to rescue. Once you have your survivor, some of the asteroids change into flying saucers. You must then fly back up through these obstacles to dock with the mothership's docking area. Do not hit the left or right of it or you lose a life and the survivor you were carrying. Once all survivors are rescued, it is off to level two.
