When attending a football game, you had a valet park your vehicle. Unfortunately, the valet was a little disgruntled as he wanted to see the game himself. To take out his frustration, he has parked the cars so yours cannot be driven out until the mess is fixed.

This is a shifting-pieces puzzle game where you move the white cars out of the way so the horizontal white car, in line with the exit, has a clear path. Place the circle cursor onto the end of a white car and press the button to turn it from red to green. Then move the joystick to move the car forwards or backwards. You cannot move them sideways or turn them. Once you have cleared a path, put the cursor on the car you need to leave with and drive it to the exit. Free the car in the fewest moves in twenty-six levels.
