The general concept behind ''Base Attack'' from Home-Vision is a reversal of the ''Atlantis'' formula from Imagic. Instead of defending the cities from an aerial attack, you're attacking the cities from the air.  You control a ship that can fire and move in all four directions. Your mission is to destroy a set of bases embedded in the landscape below you. The bases fire at you and occasionally launch missiles that will speed horizontally toward your ship. You can destroy these missiles with a blast from your cannon.
