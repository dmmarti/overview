You are Springer the rabbit. You must jump from cloud to cloud, collecting everything you can, to reach the sun.

You must jump from cloud to cloud and touch any items or eggs to collect them. If an egg hatches into a dragon, you can kick the dragon to collect him. There is a bonus timer that counts down on the screen so don't delay. Once you reach the sun at the top, then it is off to a more challenging screen.
