In Squeeze Box your goal is to escape from prison! To escape, you will need to blast your way through the wall on either the left or right side of the screen. Once a hole large enough to walk through is formed, you can use it to escape to the next screen. To make the game more difficult, the walls are constantly growing, and if you touch a wall you will lose a life! A second game variation is included where one wall is stationary, and the second wall grows. Your goal is to shoot all of the moving multi-colored wall blocks to turn them white. A row of blocks turns white when they all of have been destroyed; the row will then begin growing again, but you will now longer be able to shoot the blocks! When all of the rows have been changed to white, you will move on to the next level. The third (and final) game variation included is similar to the second one, except that the wall behind you will also move inwards; Your goal is still to shoot your way through the left wall before the right wall catches up to you. Each variation has two difficulty levels, the tougher difficulty has twice as many blocks as the easier.
