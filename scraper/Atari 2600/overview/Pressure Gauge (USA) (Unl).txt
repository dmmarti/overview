Pressure Guage's gameplay is a simple as its graphics, albeit not that easy to describe. On the left of the screen is a small colored line. On the right is a line that starts at the top of the screen and slowly descends. This is your timer. Next to the left line is a line that starts at the bottom and rises to the top. When it reaches the top, it restarts at the bottom. The object is to press your button when the rising line on the left is within the small line on the left. This will cause a new line to rise. If you press the button when the rising line is not in the left small line or let the rising line reach the top, the new line will lower. To clear the level, get the new line all the way to the top. If you do not get the new line to the top before the descending line on the right reaches the bottom, the game is over.
