Steady your nerves and concentration. You're about to play Shanghai! Shanghai is based on an ancient game that's over 25 centuries old. Over the years since, it has been a favorite of pirates and smugglers, flappers and gangsters, of working men and the well-to-do. Now you can play it too, on the Sega System. The game is simple... the strategy complex. Remove 144 tiles from a pyramid; two matching tiles at a time. But be careful. Remove the wrong two tiles and you're left with no more matching pairs... game over! It's a game everyone can play and enjoy.
