Lunar Lander is based on other variants of Lunar Lander (also known by other names such as LEM), popular on mainframes and early home computers.

This version of the game features vector graphics and requires input in real-time. The goal for the player is to land on the moon, by applying thrust to the lander in different directions. If the player hits the moon with too much velocity or lands on uneven terrain the lander will crash. When things tend to go wrong the player can press the abort button to quickly launch the lander back up again. The abort action and applying thrust costs precious fuel of which the player only has a limited amount. The player can rotate the lander to change his direction with more thrust. When the player gets closer to the moon the view zooms in to show a better view of the landing site.
