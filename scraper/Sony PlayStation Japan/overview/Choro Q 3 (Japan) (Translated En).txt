With Choro Q 3 Takara and Tamsoft finally managed to reach the zenith of their Choro Q license. This racing game is, without a doubt, the best one in the Choro Q series.

The gameplay is where Choro Q3 shines. The Choro Q cars have very short wheelbases, so they have different physics than cars in other racing games. In order to succeed here, you have to re-learn how to drive.

The parts the player starts with are supposed to be inferior to some of the ones you will get later on. As you win more races, you'll gain enough money to soup up your tiny car to be quick and agile.

Buying new parts for your car is part of the fun. There are more parts in this game than any other Choro Q game on the Playstaton. There are many different types of tires, like Racing, Semi-Racing, Off-Road, Water, Snow, and Big Tires (think Monster Trucks). There are lots of engines, transmissions and brakes, too. You can get spoilers, new chassises, and even horns and speedometers. There is a high degree of customization here.
