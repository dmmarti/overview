Jennifer and her three friends, Lotte, Ann, and Laura,
have been chosen to be adopted by the mysterious, yet
unquestionably wealthy Mr. Barrows, who lives in a mansion
known as Clock Tower (Hence the game's name) because of 
it's own, quite large Clock Tower, by whose chimes the locals
once tended their fields before it apparently stopped running 
nearly a decade before the game's events.  

Jennifer and her friends are led to their new home by Mary, or, 
as they often call her, Ms. Mary out of respect.  They're thrilled 
to have a new home, especially this particular home, which 
is obviously spectacular from the moment they enter the main hall.  

However, a place this big was bound to hold secrets..
And the secrets of Clock Tower are darker than those
of most estates..  Because Jennifer and her friends are
about to discover that the Barrows family is far from
normal..  That evil lives even within the wall of the most 
beautiful places.  And that there are some things 
worse than being in an orphanage..
