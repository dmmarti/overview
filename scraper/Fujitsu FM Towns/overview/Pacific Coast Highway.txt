Pacific Coast Highway (stylized as Pacific Coast Hwy) is a game written Ron Rosen for the Atari 8-bit family and published by Datasoft in 1982. It is a clone of Frogger, with the key gameplay differences being that Pacific Coast Highway allows two-player simultaneous play, and the highway and water segments are split into separate, alternating, screens. The game was not ported to any other systems.</Notes
