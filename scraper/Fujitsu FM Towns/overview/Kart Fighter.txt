Kart Fighter (Chinese: 瑪莉快打; pinyin: Mǎ lì kuài dǎ, "Mario Fighter") is an unlicensed 2D fighting game produced for the Nintendo Famicom. The game features unauthorized appearances by Nintendo's mascot Mario and the rest of the cast of Super Mario Kart in a port of Street Fighter II. Kart Fighter has received some media attention, including mostly positive reviews, in part because of its perceived similarity to the later Super Smash Bros. series.</Notes
