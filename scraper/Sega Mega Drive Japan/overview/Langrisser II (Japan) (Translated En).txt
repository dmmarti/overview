Langrisser II is the second entry in the Langrisser strategy RPG series, originally known as Warsong in the United States. Masiya returned to developed the sequel and NCS published the title in Japan for the Mega Drive on August 26, 1994. A year later a remake of Langrisser II was released for the Super Famicom called Der Langrisser, which featured reworked graphics and new story paths. Unlike the original Langrisser the second installment was never released outside of Japan but in 2008 an unofficial English patch was created by MIJET.
