Thunder Pro Wrestling Retsuden is a spinoff of Human's popular Fire Pro Wrestling series, and the only title in the series to appear on the Mega Drive. Like the other Fire Pro games, it is an arcade-style wrestling game featuring a roster of fictional wrestlers. The game includes a standard World Championship mode where the player picks a wrestler and fights his way to win the title. There is also an "Exciting" mode in which one or two players can play an exhibition singles or tag match against the computer or each other, an Elimination mode where each player picks a team of five wrestlers, and a "Handicap" mode where one fighter must alone take on a tag team.
