Alex Kidd, resident of planet Aries, is the brother to the king. One day he comes across a rumor that his long lost father, King Thor, is alive and somewhere on the planet Paperock.  
 
Now Paperock is a place where you have to be good at the game of 'Paper, Rock and Scissors' to get anywhere. With that knowledge you must take control of Alex, guide him through the odd natured, unfriendly planet and help him find his father.
