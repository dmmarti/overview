In this game, once again you are Shinobi, but this time you're out not to free hostages, but to gain your revenge. 
 
All you have to do is go around killing people with "shurikins", or throwing knives. 
You can also get power pack upgrades. Once you touch it, your knives turn into fire and you have a ninja sword. 
 
You have to do 3 rounds per zone, kick the butt of a boss and hey presto! You're done on that zone.
