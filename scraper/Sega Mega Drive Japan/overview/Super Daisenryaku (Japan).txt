Super Daisenryaku is one of the many titles in SystemSoft's long-running war strategy series. The game mechanics are based on Daisenryaku II, but many of the 35 included maps are unique to this release, including several based on Phantasy Star. There is no scenario mode, and any of the included maps can be played. Some maps are for two players, some for four, and any map can be played with any combination of human and computer players. 
 
The game is played on a large map made up of hexagonal spaces, each of which is a specific type of terrain. Each player controls a number of units, which each take up one space on the grid. Different units have different strengths and weaknesses toward other units, which are also affected by the terrain. Each player controls a capital, and the goal is to capture the other players' capitals.
