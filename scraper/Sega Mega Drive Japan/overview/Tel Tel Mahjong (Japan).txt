Tel-Tel Mahjong is a computer mahjong game, one of many conversions of the ancient Chinese game. The main draw of this particular version is online play through the Mega Modem, but this service has long since been discontinued. Based on the four-player version of the game, the player can play against three computer players, and there is both a regular match mode with a wide range of game options, as well as a ranking mode where the player must face increasingly skilled opponents.
