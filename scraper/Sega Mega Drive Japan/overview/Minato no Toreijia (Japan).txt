Now, finally, his chance has come. His uncle, a travelling merchant, is going on a journey, and Roy decides to leave with him.

The game is a party-based RPG with randomly encountered enemies. The combat is somewhat similar to early Ultima games. When an enemy appears, you enter a battle screen on which your party is positioned in the lower part, the enemies in the upper part. You can attack if you are close enough to the enemy, otherwise you'll just move towards him. Magic spells should be cast to an appropriate direction to hurt the enemy.
