	<path>./[SegaNet] 16t (Japan).zip</path>
	<desc>16t is a scrolling platform action game similar to Teddy Boy, in which the player controls a youngster in prison garb named Apple Gaikichi, who must eliminate all the enemies on each stage. Apple's only method of attack is throwing enormous 16 ton weights (thus the title), which can and will crush enemies in a bloody mess. However, these weights will bounce off each other, so the player must be careful to not let Apple get crushed himself. They are also not entirely unlimited, as the player can only hold five at once, and they must be allowed to recharge when Apple runs out. Enemies on each stage will appear from the top of the screen in waves, through a randomly cycling "slots" meter, and once all slots and enemies have been cleared, the player moves on to the next stage.</desc>

As the player builds, development will spring up around the tracks and stations, bringing in income by which more tracks and stations can be built.

The game offers a total of five different scenarios of increasing difficulty, ranging from a practice scenario for beginners to very difficult scenarios for experienced players. There are also three different game speed settings available.</desc>

	<desc>Similar to its predecessor, the premise of After Burner II is to get on the F-14 Tomcat and fly mission after mission of shooting planes out of the sky. At your disposal is a vulcan cannon (basically a machine gun) and a limited number of missiles. In some versions of the game the guns fire automatically all the time. Sometimes you come across a friendly supply plane and if you dock with it you can replenish your missiles.

The game is viewed from behind the plane with you fighting wave after wave of enemy fighters. But at heart it offers the usual shooter mechanics, meaning you spend most of your time dodging and shooting. You also can speed up and slow down to deal with enemies which appear behind you.</desc>

	<path>./Alisia Dragoon (Japan).zip</path>
	<desc>Alisia Dragoon is the female protagonist of this fast-paced platform game. Alisia must destroy an evil demon and avenge her fathers death through eight stages. She has only one weapon to dispose of enemies: thunder magic. This magic is auto-aiming and can track multiple targets. However, the game is quite hard as the levels are loaded with fantasy-inspired monsters. Using thunder magic reduces a magic gauge, meaning you often have to wait for it to recharge. Once fully charged Alisia can unleash a massive rolling blast of lightning across the screen.

During the game, you can improve your magic by picking up potions. There are also four monsters which accompany Alisia: Dragon Frye, Ball O'Fire, Thunder Raven and Boomerang Lizard. Each has different abilities, deciding which, if any, to use in a given situation is part of the challenge. These monsters, like Alisia herself, are fully upgradeable with power-ups. They can also die if weakened too much, forcing you to hunt for a reviving power-up. You can pause the game and select your companion at any time.</desc>

But the evil jealous demon named "Y" turn them both into stone paddles. Suddenly, a blue sphere fell from the sky, becoming the ball which the paddles can now push forwards, overcoming obstacles and defeating demons.

"Devilish" is different from other paddle games by letting you play with two paddles. The lower one behaves just like a usual paddle - you use it to prevent the ball from dropping down. The upper one can move and turn, allowing you to hit the ball from different angles and from different parts of the screen. You advance through levels by destroying bricks and enemies, going up until the level boss enemy appears.</desc>

	<path>./Bare Knuckle - Ikari no Tetsuken - Streets of Rage (World) (Rev A).zip</path>
	<desc>Streets of Rage, Sega's answer to Final Fight, follows the story of three young police officers (Adam Hunter, Axel Stone and Blaze Fielding) in a city controlled by a criminal syndicate led by a "Mr. X" where crime is rampant, which leads the three heroes to make a pact to leave the force and topple the syndicate by themselves.

Gameplay is straightforward and simple. Three buttons are used, one to jump, other to attack and another to perform a range attack from a support police car. Each character has a limited set of moves that include punching and kicking or performing a back attack (if in the open), two grapple moves (depending if holding the opponent in front or by the back), a flying attack, and if playing with another player two additional tag attacks, and different abilities: Adam is slow, but a good jumper and a hard hitter, Axel fast and also a hard hitter, but a lousy jumper and Blaze fast and a good jumper, but weak hitter.
Levels are in typical arcade side-scroller fashion: move from left to right (with two exceptions), clearing screens from enemies one after another as fast as possible while avoid taking damage with a boss in the end. Some levels feature "death drops" where the player must avoid falling, while throwing enemies there at the same time, including a typical elevator level. Several items are scattered on the ground, from melee weapons and bonus points (and lives or additional police cars) to apples and turkeys (to restore health).</desc>
	<path>./Bare Knuckle II (Japan).zip</path>
	<desc>After Axel Stone, Blaze Fielding and Adam Hunter destroyed the evil Syndicate leader, Mr. X, the city became a peaceful place to live, and each one of them followed their own paths. One year later, after their reunion, Adam's brother Sammy returned from school to find their apartment in a mess, and Adam nowhere to be seen, and after calling his two friends, one of them notices a photo of Adam chained to a wall, next to someone they knew very well - Mr. X, who returned to turn the peaceful city once again into a war zone. Now, Axel, Blaze, Sammy, and Axel's good friend Max, a pro wrestler, must head out to stop Mr. X once again...hopefully for good...

Streets of Rage 2 differs from the previous title in several ways. There are changes in both graphics (characters now are bigger, more detailed and with more animation frames, and scenarios are less grainy) and gameplay (the rocket move was replaced by a special move that doubles in offense and defense along several new moves), along other new features such as life bars (and names) for all enemies and the radically different new characters.</desc>
	<path>./Bare Knuckle III (Japan).zip</path>
	<desc>In part three of the Streets of Rage series, Mr. X is back and this time his plan involves replacing public officials with his own robots. Only Axel, Blaze, Skate, and new-comer Dr. Zan can stop him. Streets of Rage 3 features all of the beat 'em up action you would expect from a Streets of Rage game. One new feature is the special move power bar, where it only costs energy to do a special move if the bar isn't full. Also new is the ability to do special maneuvers with different weapons, depending on the character. For example, Skate has no special move with the pipe, but does have one with the knife. The opposite is true for Axel. Any weapon Dr. Zan picks up is turned into energy balls which he can throw at the enemies. Secret characters and multiple endings add replay value.</desc>
	<path>./Batman (Japan).zip</path>
	<desc>The Genesis version of Batman: The Video Game follows closely the plot from the 1989 movie.

The game consists in six stages, four of side-scrolling platform action and two side-scrolling shooter ones, in the following order: Gotham City Street, Axis Chemical Factory, Flugelheim Museum, Gotham City Street (with the Batmobile and after that on foot), In the Sky over Gotham City (with the Batwing) and the Cathedral, where Batman finally faces the Joker.

Batman can beat his enemies by punching them, slide kicking (by pressing down and the B button) or throwing his Batarang. By holding down the B button, Batman will block projectile-based attacks. He can also use his double jump (pressing the C button a second time while ascending) to leap greater distances or attack his enemies. To reach higher platforms, Batman can use his Grappling Hook (by pressing up and C to shoot, C again to climb). While piloting the Batmobile or the Batwing, Batman can shoot the Twin Vulcan Cannons (B button) or Twin Homing Missiles (A button).

Through the levels, Batman will collect Batman emblems (which will give him Batarangs or Twin Homing Missiles, depending on the stage played), Hearts (which give him health) and Batman heads (which give him an extra life).

	<desc>Gil Hazard, president of the Hazard Foundation, is secretly Professor G, the leader of the evil Dark Hazard organization. He has designs on world domination, and has plans to use the power of golf toward this end; this is the Battle Golfer project. Yui Mizuhara and Ran Ryuzaki are two ordinary high school girls who just so happen to be golf prodigies, and so are prime candidates for the Battle Golfer project. They are abducted by Professor G, but are rescued by a mysterious man before they can be taken under his control. Having escaped, Yui hears about a golf tournament being held by the Hazard Foundation, and suspecting more nefarious plans, she secretly enters the tournament to stop him for good.

Battle Golfer Yui is a unique genre fusion between a golf game and a Japanese-style adventure game. The main adventure mode casts the player as Yui competing in the Hazard Cup tournament. The player can interact with other characters on the course, and will need to defeat several different opponents at match play on oddly-themed courses in order to proceed. The system is quite simple and fast-paced; simply choose a direction, a club, spin, and hit the bar with the right timing to adjust shot power. Each character also has special abilities to help them out, but these are limited in use. There is also a regular golf mode for one or two players, offered as both stroke and match play.</desc>

During close combat, pressing the A or C button rapidly will result in a throwing or choking attack. There is no visible health bar, but three icons are displayed at the bottom of the screen. Once a dragon is knocked down for a longer moment, one icon turns red. Once all icons are red, the fight is lost. The battle arena is surrounded by an electric fence, that opponents can be thrown into and which can also be used to initiate jump attacks.

There are two modes of play: Match and Tournament. Match is a single match for one or two players, where several different dragons are available. Tournament sees the player starting out with a week dragon who has to fight increasingly difficult battles and increase his stats (Power, Speed and Stamina). After every other battle, a shop can be visited that offers different items including food that increases Power, Speed or Stamina, Data Disks that contain information on other Dragons and more. After visiting the shop, Dragons can be trained. The training consists of simply selecting an attribute to be increased. At a few points in the game, it is possible to splice the player's Dragon's genes which that of a defeated Opponent to gain different abilities.</desc>

Each mode can be played against either the computer or a friend, and there are three different lane types available. There is also a practice mode for each of the game types.

The Japanese version, Boogie Woogie Bowling, is largely the same but features different, more anime-style characters to play as (including a robot for no explained reason), as well as minor tweaks to the timing for throws.</desc>

	<path>./Chelnov (Japan).zip</path>
	<desc>One windy day, there was an explosion at a nuclear power station, causing heavy doses of radiation to be poured over many people. One of these people was a young scientist named Chelnov. When he survived the deadly accident, he was possessed with abnormal powers. Having realized this, he decided to act in the cause of justice. He is determined to escape the Eastern Bloc country he called home and run and jump across the world to finish in the US.

What distinguishes Chelnov from other platform games is its use of forced scrolling. This occurs when the screen moves continuously from left to right, forcing players to negotiate the game's many obstacles and enemies without controlling Chelnov's speed of progress. Enemies attack from left, right, above, and below, and Chelnov can switch the direction he's facing to attack enemies that are behind him. Some enemies in the game carry different types of weapons and power-ups, and when they are shot at, the power-ups drop to the ground and can be picked up.</desc>

Otto is given a letter of marque by the king and ordered to terrorize the Spanish Fleet. Equipping himself simply at first, Otto strives to become a great Privateer in the name of King and Country.

Regardless of the character chosen, Uncharted Waters: New Horizons is a top-down sailing simulation. At sea, players control the direction of their ship, where speed is affected by the number/health of the crew, the wind and the currents. Players can navigate anywhere there is water (though some ships are not ocean worthy) and discover interesting landmarks and new ports. Upon landing at a port, the view is also top-down and the player can enter different buildings, each with unique services and goods. These include: The Inn, the Item Shop, The Shipyard, The Tavern, The Castle, The Guild Hall, The Church, The Merchant and the Harbor. It's up to the player to earn enough gold to keep the crew fed and financed and keep the fleet repaired. Primary methods of earning money are through sea trade, accepting jobs from the guild, gambling and battle with other ships.

During naval combat, the game becomes a turn-based top-down strategy game, with the player moving ships in order to obtain trajectories needed to fire cannons at enemy ships, or run alongside enemy vessels in order to board them. If the player's flagship attacks the flagship of the enemy fleet, they can challenge the opponent to a duel. If accepted, the game changes to a side-view of the two captains engaged in a fight. During this sequence, the player can only choose which fighting maneuver (strike, thrust, parry, lash) they wish to engage in.

	<path>./Dangerous Seed (Japan).zip</path>
	<desc>It is the 25th century, and the solar system has come under attack by an mysterious alien enemy known as Dangerous Seed. Human forces have been decimated, and the aliens' next target is Earth! The enemy draws closer to the frontline base on the moon by the hour, and the final line of defense for Earth, the fighter ship Moon Diver, has launched.

Dangerous Seed is a vertical scrolling shooter converted from the 1989 Namco coin-op. The player controls the three-part fighter ship Moon Diver through 12 stages to confront the alien menace and secure peace in the solar system. Each of the three parts of the ship, Alpha, Beta, and Gamma, have their own properties which can be combined in various ways. Each type and combination has multiple shot types which can be powered up, and there are also options and bombs available which contribute to Moon Diver's extensive arsenal.</desc>

	<desc>Lakya is a technologically-advanced civilization on a planet far from our own galaxy. The planet's inhabitants have unknowingly unleashed the planet's life force, Evol. As the Evol drifts from Lakya, it reaches a planet called Cokyo, whose inhabitants use it to attack and invade Lakya. Now, fighters from Lakya must fight back against the invading army by using the Evol themselves.

Darwin 4081 is a vertical scrolling shooter based on the 1987 Data East coin-op Super Real Darwin. The main attraction of the game is the ability to evolve your ship into a wide variety of different forms, each with their own attack abilities, by collecting DNA dropped by enemies. Other powerups will increase you ship's speed, give you an option that follows your ship, or even increase the power of your smart bombs. The game features surreal futuristic art design fitting of its title.</desc>

	<desc>Doki Doki Penguin Land MD is a 16-bit remake of the classic Master System puzzle game Penguin Land. The player controls a penguin who must get an egg from the top of each stage to the bottom, where his girlfriend is waiting for him. The player must break ice blocks to open a path, but if the egg falls too far, it will break. There are numerous hazards that the player must watch out for, including moving platforms, solid iron blocks, blocks that will break as soon as the egg touches them, moving spikes, and tubes through which only the penguin or the egg can pass.

The player can also find special items to help out; hearts will increase the bonus score, wings let the penguin jump higher, and iron eggs let the egg fall further without breaking. There are a total of 30 puzzles to solve, with a password given every five stages. The game also lets you pause the game to view the entire map, as well as set a waypoint to return to should the egg break.

	<desc>A dream thief has come and stolen the dreams of all the children, using them to create his own personal paradise where nobody may trespass. The children can't continue on without their dreams, and someone need to save them...that someone being Doraemon, the mechanical blue cat from the future! Finding his friends have lost their color, Doraemon flies into the sky and chases after the dream thief into his world of dreams.

	<path>./Double Dragon II - The Revenge (Japan).zip</path>
	<desc>The lovely Marian was rescued from the clutches of the Black Warriors gang by Billy &amp; Jimmy Lee in the first Double Dragon game, but now the gang has killed her in retaliation of their early defeat. The Dragons must now embark on a mission to avenge her death and defeat the Black Warriors for the second and final time.

The original arcade version of "Double Dragon II" was essentially an improved version of the first game. In addition to offering renewed audio and visuals, as well as new traps, moves and enemy characters, "Double Dragon II" discarded the conventional punch and kick buttons in favor of a direction-oriented attacking system similar to the original Technos beat-em-up Renegade.

The NES version offered new stages, new moves and illustrated cut-scenes, as well as a new final boss and a new ending. Unlike the first NES game, it offered 2-Player Co-Op gameplay with the option to turn off the friendly fire.

The Game Boy version of "Double Dragon II" is an English localization of a "Kunio-kun" game (the Japanese franchise which inspired "Renegade" and "River City Ransom" and has nothing to do with the arcade and NES versions.

	<path>./Dragon Ball Z - Buyuu Retsuden (Japan).zip</path>
	<desc>Dragon Ball Z: L'Appel Du Destin is a fighting game that maintains the dual screen mode previously seen in the DBZ Super Butouden series of the SNES, which allowed you to be far from the opponent yet still be able to see him by having the screen split between the two characters. This is important to note, as the most damaging attack of the game could be just executed from far away of your opponent, the energy fireball projectiles. These special attacks also need that you have your KI bar (which unlike energy one, is rechargeable) to a considerable level and the only way to block them is by means of a long button combination.

The constitution of the characters is based strictly on the Freezer and Cell sagas (Son Goku SSJ, Son Gohan SSJ2, Piccolo, Vegeta SSJ, Future Trunks SSJ, Krilin, Recoome, Ginyu, Freezer, A-18 and Perfect Cell), with special mention to Krilin, Ginyu and Recoome, who made here their first appearance in a fighting game. There are also 9 scenarios available, all of them corresponding to recognizable areas of the anime itself, some also appearing for 2 times but in different status (ie, "normal" Namek and Namek "in flames").

	<path>./Dyna Brothers 2 (Japan).zip</path>
	<desc>Planet Jura is a green and beautiful place where dinosaurs have lived for longer than anyone can remember. One day, however, a giant black ship appears in the sky, and aliens come down to the surface and start attacking the dinosaurs. Feeling their suffering, the dinosaurs' creator, The Egg, awakens. To protect their race and their planet, the dinosaurs must fight the invading aliens, and force them to leave Planet Jura.

Dyna Brothers 2 is a real-time strategy game comparable to Populous. The player controls their small army of dinosaurs against the invading enemy alien army. There are six types of units, each of which has different skills and proficiencies. The player can order their dinosaurs to move or attack, and can also hatch new dinosaurs from The Egg. There are also environmental commands like earthquakes and lightning strikes.

The game features a practice mode, story mode, and free mode, as well as a 2-player versus mode where the second player takes the role of the alien invaders.</desc>
	<path>./Ecco the Dolphin (Japan).zip</path>
	<desc>Travel through time along with Ecco the dolphin, in the only game that could call itself a "dolphin simulator". Indeed, you can do pretty much everything a typical dolphin does, including eating fish, surfacing in order to breathe, using your biological sonar and of course, jumping out of the water to amaze your friends.

The storyline is actually deeper that one may think by looking at the box illustration. As Ecco, you are the only dolphin who managed to escape from a giant whirlpool which sucked down your entire pod. The five shining stars on your forehead show that you are the chosen one to save them. But that task will be not be an easy one, as you will have to travel through time and space with the Atlantean time machine, and meet the mystical Asterite in order to defeat the Vortex Queen.</desc>
	<path>./Ecco the Dolphin II (Japan).zip</path>
	<desc>The followup to Ecco the Dolphin, in which Ecco successfully destroyed the Vortex. Unfortunately, it turns out that the Vortex Queen followed it to the Earth and eventually destroyed the Asterite. All the world's oceans are threatened, and actually already doomed.

In order to restore the Asterite and finally defeat the Vortex Queen, Ecco will have to confront once again the tides of time, which have split into two possible futures, the regular one and the dark one dominated by the Vortex Queen.

Ecco: The Tides of Time features even better graphics than its predecessor, and introduces a new gameplay mode in which the camera follows the dolphin from behind instead of from the side.

	<path>./Eliminate Down (Japan).zip</path>
	<desc>Eliminate Down is a horizontally-scrolling shooter similar in style to Thunder Force. The player has several weapons that can be freely switched (forward shot, back shot, and missile), and can also change the speed of the ship. Enemies come from all directions, and certain waves will drop powerups, including shields and weapon upgrades. The player needs to collect five upgrades in order to improve their weaponry, but the upgrade affects all three weapons.

The game includes eight stages, most of which include both a midboss and a boss at the end, and three difficulty settings. There is also a minigame similar to Whack-a-Mole where there is a grid of ship icons, and the player must hit the rotating ships.</desc>
	<path>./Europa Sensen (Japan).zip</path>
	<desc>The game is an historical simulation of the European and North African theaters of World War II. The game allows up to two players to role-play as Army commanders for either the Axis or Allied forces. This game emphasizes the military aspects of the war and leaves diplomacy to the politicians.

	<path>./Ex-Ranza (Japan).zip</path>
	<desc>Ranger X was released fairly late in the lifetime of the megadrive. Coming from an unknown developer it was released with little fanfare and advertising but has become one of the best demonstrations of what the genesis/megadrive is capable of.

The game is a side scrolling shooter of sorts. You control a large mech (robot) which has a smaller side-kick mech which is a bit like a car. The two can join together providing an alternate shooting mode. Whilst controlling just the main mech however, the player can shoot both forward and back by using different buttons. The mech can also use it's rocket pack to boost off of the ground and hover for a short while. Levels are not necessarily left to right moving (although for the most part they are) and the game is an interesting blend of platform game and shoot-em-up.

The game features innovative graphics given the hardware limitations - there is a 3D introduction to most levels (remembering that the console had no 3D capability and a tile-based renderer) and some levels use a line-based scrolling effect to give the impression of 3D backgrounds.</desc>
	<path>./F1 Circus MD (Japan).zip</path>
	<desc>F1 Circus '91 is a Formula 1 simulation racing game. The series did not yet feature an official license, and so just like the first game it only features generic team and driver names. The game itself plays much the same, with the overhead race view and focus on car tuning and damage. The World Championship mode has of course returned, though the managerial Constructors mode is no longer present. There is also a Free Attack mode, where any course can be freely practiced; a Training mode, where special training courses can be raced on to learn the ins and outs of the game; and a Watch mode, where the player can choose a course and watch a demonstration race.

	<path>./F1 Hero MD (Japan).zip</path>
	<desc>Following F1 Grand Prix Nakajima Satoru, Varie produced another racing simulation using the license. This time the racing is from a first person view aping Super Monaco Grand Prix. The car setup can be modified before you take to the track

There is a Time Attack mode, allowing you to go for as fast a laptime as possible on any of the game's 20 circuits (which include the 16 tracks of the 1992 Formula 1 season), as well as a full season mode, with qualifying and the race itself. Weather can be customised in the Time Attack mode but is randomly chosen in Grand Prix mode, while you can only choose one of the D-tier teams (the 4 weakest of the 16) in grand Prix mode, but can drive for McLaren, Williams et al in Time Attack.</desc>
	<path>./Fastest 1 (Japan).zip</path>
	<desc>Fastest 1 is a Formula One racing game. The game doesn't have an official FIA license, but much like Human's Fire Pro Wrestling series, includes a number of recognizable fictionalized drivers, such as Ayrton Sesna and Satoru Inakajima. The game includes a world championship mode, where the player must start from the lowest rankings and win races to become the F1 world champion. There is also a battle mode where one or two players can race each other or against computer opponents, as well as a test run mode where the player can learn each course and try to set course records. There are a total of 16 different courses, which can be played in either dry, wet, or half-wet conditions, as well as a wide variety of vehicle settings that can be tweaked.</desc>
	<path>./Fatman (Japan).zip</path>
	<desc>An eclectic, intriguing fighting game. Choose from different alien races (including Human) with different abilities and fighting styles, purchase weapons and devices, and fight your way through multiple opponents to face the Fatman.  Some of the more innovative features include being able to place wagers on the outcome of the fight, and the phenominon of a special move being less powerful the more you use it to balance gameplay.

2 player, head-to-head combat is supported.</desc>
	<path>./Final Blow (Japan).zip</path>
	<desc>Final Blow is an action game based around the sport of boxing. You can play the fighters in a sequence of knock-out competitions, (the computer versions also include a round-robin league). Rounds last one minute, with a short break in between them. As in the real sport, your aim is to knock your opponent down for 10 seconds, by gradually weakening him with a series of punches. You can block punches, to avoid them inflicting damage onto you. The ring is of a limited size, so players can be cornered, although the referee will intervene to break the boxers up if they become entangled in a stalemate position.

The genesis version is not to be confused with the Master System game of the same name, which is entirely different.</desc>
	<path>./Fire Mustang (Japan).zip</path>
	<desc>Fire Mustang is a fast side-scrolling shooter set during World War II. The player controls a P-51D Mustang plane through different missions, with many enemies on the screen at the same time and a large aircraft as a boss at the end of every mission. The Mustang has an unlimited amount of bullets, but one hit is sufficient to lose a life. There are different power-ups to collect, providing additional fire power and new firing patterns. Regardless of the power-ups, the Mustang shoots forward and drops bombs to the ground at the same time, targeting ground troops. There is a limited amount of forgers, large blasts damaging many enemies at once.</desc>

	<desc>Thunder Pro Wrestling Retsuden is a spinoff of Human's popular Fire Pro Wrestling series, and the only title in the series to appear on the Mega Drive. Like the other Fire Pro games, it is an arcade-style wrestling game featuring a roster of fictional wrestlers. The game includes a standard World Championship mode where the player picks a wrestler and fights his way to win the title. There is also an "Exciting" mode in which one or two players can play an exhibition singles or tag match against the computer or each other, an Elimination mode where each player picks a team of five wrestlers, and a "Handicap" mode where one fighter must alone take on a tag team.

	<path>./Flintstone (Japan).zip</path>
	<desc>This is a platform game based on the famous Flintstones series. The game features many original Flintstones characters, such as Fred, Wilma, Barney, and others. Instead of the usual "save the princess" or "liberate the world" kinds of a plot, "The Flintstones" is mainly based on small quests: Fred has to retrieve a lost item, etc. The large levels are divided into smaller stages. In the end of each level there is a boss battle. The gameplay involves mostly jumping and hitting the enemies on the heads with a club. The health is measured by hearts. During the game Fred will find many useful items, including some that will increase his health level.</desc>
	<path>./Fushigi no Umi no Nadia (Japan).zip</path>
	<desc>This is one of the several games based on the animé series The Secret of Blue Water. The series (and the game) are loosely based on the stories by the famous French science fiction author Jules Verne. The game is set in 1889, a time of great inventions and technology progress unseen before. You play as Jean, a young genius scientist. In Paris he meets Nadia, an African circus performer. Nadia wears a pendant that contains magical powers, and that is why the evil Gargoyle is after her - this pendant is just the item she needs to build the ultimate weapon, the Tower of Babel. Jean will do anything to protect Nadia, and hope that his love to her, his adventurer spirit, and the power of science will eventually defeat Gargoyle!

Unlike most Japanese adventures, "Fushigi no Umi no Nadia" is a top-down, third-person perspective game, in which you actually move your character around. Nadia and other friends join Jean in a RPG-like fashion (although there is no combat in the game, different characters have their own item-based abilities you should use at certain points). There are no real puzzles in the game, but you'll often have to use your inventory items to make the game progress.

Not to confuse with other Fushigi no Umi no Nadia games (for NES, Turbo CD, etc.)!</desc>

Along the way Lucia will have to shoot down dozens of enemies in standard shooter fashion, while avoiding destruction and collecting power-ups that extend her ship's energy, upgrade weapons and gather screen-clearing bombs.

The Gleylancer comes equipped with two hovering satellites that can receive weapon upgrades of their own, and can lock their positions at specific angles to increase your firepower and protect the player from enemy attacks. Features only a single-player campaign with two different endings depending on how the final stages are completed (e.g. if Lucia's father is rescued or not).

	<desc>In an era of frequent alien attacks, the Earth has a unified Government, which relies on a line of cyborgs known as the Heavy Dolls for defense. The greatest of these are known as the Heavy Nova, a title earned by passing a rigorous training regime.

You are taking on the simulated proving grounds, which are split into two styles of alternating action. In the first you must progress (initially purely horizontally, though later with vertical flick-scrolling as well) through a hostile environment of enemies, bombs and traps, gaining points for doing it quickly and with lots of energy left. Initially you can fly and kick as needed.

Once this section is complete, you move on to one-on-one combat of the Street Fighter 2 style. The early foes have far less energy than you begin with. As you progress through the game, you are awarded extra attacking moves, in a manner similar to Brutal: Paws of Fury</desc>

	<desc>Danpei Ichigeki is a young boy who loves dodgeball. Danpei's father was a famous dodgeball player when he was still alive, and he joins the Dodgeball Club at his elementary school. However, these kids are very serious about their dodgeball, and the road ahead isn't going to be easy for Danpei.

Dodge Danpei is a team dodgeball game, one of several based on the anime and manga created by Tetsuhiro Koshita, which plays strikingly similar to the well-known Super Dodge Ball. Each team has four main players and three support players, and attempts to knock out the opposing team's main members by throwing the ball at them in various ways. Apart from normal throws, the player can also pass to teammates, and execute special power throws which are harder to dodge or catch.

The game includes several different game modes, including the main story mode which follows the story of the anime, as well as one- and two-player exhibition matches. There is also a "league" mode which allows for a tournament of up to six teams, as well as a training mode where the game teaches the basics of how to play the game.</desc>

	<desc>The Hybrid Front is a turn-based strategy video game, released in Japan (exclusively) for the Mega Drive.

The introduction begins with someone logging into a computer. Then, it shows a revolution that occurred sometime in the 2080s leading into a series of wars and conflict that lead up to the video game's main setting of the 26th century. Since the second half of the 21st century, the depletion of fossil fuel resources have helped to deepen the conflict on Earth...
During the 24th century, the Earth was bombarded from orbit with massive optical weapons called the Metal Hammer by an Italian consortium; major cities around the world were burned to toast. The resistance would eventually be put down by CoCoON (abbreviation for COoperation COmmunity of Orbital Negotiation). Not only they would gain the corporate hegemony of humanity, CoCoON would develop a reputation as a hostile group of corporate war hawks; constantly revolting against the peaceful coalition of the PETO (abbreviation for Pan Earth Treaty Organization).

The round ends when a player reaches the destination set at the start of the round, which gives a points bonus. The player with the most points after a set number of rounds is the winner.

	<path>./Hyper Marbles (SN) (Japan).zip</path>
	<desc>In the future, even the simple kids game of marbles is high-tech and extreme. Hyper Marbles takes the basic concept of the classic kids game -- to knock the opponent's marbles out of the playfield -- and gives it a futuristic sci-fi twist. The player directs their robotic marble around the field, attempting to push their opponents into the deadly electrified walls lining the arena. Aiding in this is a jet booster, which can cause opponents to bounce quite far, but if overused will overheat and must cool down before being used again. There are ten different arenas, each with different hazards like oil slicks and moving barriers. There is a single player mode, where the goal is to destroy all enemies to move on, as well as a two-player versus mode where the goal is to destroy the other player.</desc>
	<path>./I Love Mickey &amp; Donald - Fushigi na Magic Box (Japan).zip</path>
	<desc>World of Illusion is sort of a follow-up to Castle of Illusion. Mickey Mouse and Donald Duck are taken to a magic world and have to get back home. In order to do that, they can play magical tricks and interact to each other in a 2-player mode. Like other Disney games for SEGA consoles of the same period, the game has cartoon-like graphics and is played as a side-scrolling platformer.</desc>
	<path>./I Love Mickey Mouse - Fushigi no Oshiro Dai Bouken (Japan).zip</path>
	<desc>This is the first Mickey Mouse game for Sega consoles. In this game the famous Disney character must face the dangers of weird fantasy lands such as an enchanted forest and a toy world. Mickey must rescue his girlfriend Minnie who's been kidnapped by the evil witch Mizrabel.

The game play follows the traditional 2D hop 'n' bop platform style in both 8-bit and 16-bit versions. Apart from the story and the music, which is the same, all the rest (including controls, moves, stages and, obviously, graphics), are totally different.</desc>

The game once again includes an arcade mode for one or two players. This time, the player is questing to rescue a kidnapped princess from an evil knight. There is also a quest mode which plays like a simple RPG, where battles are fought via minigames. Of course, the four-player competition and free modes also make a return, rounding out the package.</desc>
	<path>./J. League Champion Soccer (Japan).zip</path>
	<desc>European Club Soccer has dozens of teams from all across Europe (around 170), and each country is represented by at least two teams. In addition to correct club names, it also has recognizable imitations of team badges and kits; although more elaborate kits (such as those worn by Juventus, FC Porto or Celtic F.C.) are simplified (Juventus have a silver shirt, Porto blue and Celtic green). Player names, on the other hand, were made by mixing names found on real squads. Portuguese teams, for instance, had a large number of Yugoslavian players in the early 1990s, and that was reflected by players with names such as Valentim Ivic (of Valentim Loureiro and Tomislav Ivic, then Boavista FC chairman and S.L. Benfica manager, respectively). Names could not be changed, and since the game lacked a battery, it does not store changes done to kits and passwords were used to resume tournaments (example of a password sheet). Rotherham United are included amongst the English clubs despite never playing in the top tier of English football, this is due to the developer, Krisalis Software, being based in Rotherham. All other clubs have played in their own country's top tier.</desc>

	<desc>A daughter of the chair of a local high school, Yu Honjo, has been kidnapped by someone unknown. Unable to go to the police, the girl's sister, Mai, hires a private investigator to find out what happened to her. The only piece of evidence is a photograph from the night of Yu's disappearance, where the missing girl and three other students from the same school are playing a game of mahjong.

Jantei Monogatari is a hybrid of a traditional-style Japanese adventure game and a regular mahjong game. The player takes the role of the unnamed private investigator, and moves from place to place via menus, talking to different characters. The investigation happens through playing mahjong with each suspect: win and they'll tell you a bit more of what they know. At first, the investigator can only speak with the three girls in the photo, but as he wins games of mahjong against them, he gains information and experience that allow him to find new clues and talk to more suspects. The investigator will need to play against a dozen different opponents in his attempt to find out what happened to the kidnapped girl.</desc>

	<path>./Killing Game Show, The (Japan).zip</path>
	<desc>This is a vertical platformer with horizontal wrap-around. For the entertainment of the futuristic masses, you play a criminal that has been inserted into a mechanical body with the promise that if you succeed in surviving through all the levels (there are many and they are hard), you will be set free.
You start each level at the bottom, near pooling liquid which will soon rise, at your immediate peril. Navigate the level from bottom to the exit at the top before the liquid rises and kills you. There are many other foes that fly around, causing you damage and basically annoying you to spit.
Most levels must be navigated through a series of keyed gates, doors, or portals. These shaped keys are scattered around the map and must by picked up and used only on the gates they match individually.
Twist: You can only carry one special weapon (triple shot, laser beam, or vertical shot) and one tool (key, liquid-freeze, or a red herring) at a time.
This game requires a lot of memorization of enemy movement patterns and optimum routes.
A unique feature is that when you die, you can watch a replay and take over at any point to continue your game.
You can also hit the HELP button at the start of each level to view a map, helping you plan your route.</desc>

	<desc>Megapanel is a tile-based puzzle game that plays like a mixture of Tetris Attack and a traditional sliding tile puzzle. Blocks rise from the bottom of a well, and the player must slide them around in order to create a row or column of three same-color blocks. This causes the group to clear, and potentially create chains from the blocks above falling. As the game continues, the number of blocks that must be cleared to continue as well as the speed at which the stack rises will both increase.

The game includes three modes. First is training mode which explains the basics of the game. In this mode, a certain number of blocks must be cleared to complete the stage. Second is a "pin-up" mode for one player, where clearing blocks reveals parts of an image of a cute anime girl, the goal being to uncover the entire picture. Last is a two-player versus mode, where players compete to clear their blocks the fastest, and can send garbage blocks to their opponent and fill up their field. The game includes two difficulty settings, two versus modes, a sound test, and a unique mode that displays the entire game in sepia tone.</desc>

Each "race" is made up of two heats of two parts each, and hits or kills on the other team earns points. During each heat, each team takes one turn attacking (four vehicles on the course) and one turn defending (three vehicles on the course). The team with the most points at the end of the last heat wins a reward and moves on to the next match.

However, your team won't get very far with just its basic equipment. After choosing your team's colors and members, you must then purchase upgrades for each person: engines, fuel, AI, armor, and of course weapons. During the game, you can switch freely between each member of your team. Your vehicle automatically moves forward around the track, but you can turn, throttle, and brake in order to move closer to or escape from the other team.

After each successful match there is a game of chance where winnings can be increased. There is also a two-player simultaneous battle mode.</desc>

	<desc>In "Traysia", you control a young man named Roy, who lives in the town Johanna. All his life Roy has been dreaming about leaving the town and going to explore faraway lands. Now, finally, his chance has come. His uncle, a travelling merchant, is going on a journey, and Roy decides to leave with him. His girlfriend Traysia gives him a pendant, to remind him of her... will Roy be able to escape from all the dangers that await him on his long journey and to see Traysia again?

The game is a party-based RPG with randomly encountered enemies. The combat is somewhat similar to early Ultima games. When an enemy appears, you enter a battle screen on which your party is positioned in the lower part, the enemies in the upper part. You can attack if you are close enough to the enemy, otherwise you'll just move towards him. Magic spells should be cast to an appropriate direction to hurt the enemy.</desc>
	<path>./Monster World IV (Japan).zip</path>
	<desc>This is a sequel to Wonder Boy 5: Monster World 3. You control Asha, the green-haired girlfriend of Shion, the hero of the previous game. One day, Asha was standing on a cliff near her home village, and suddenly heard a mysterious voice calling for help. She decided to leave the village and to embark on an adventure to discover the identity of this mysterious person.

Monster World 4 is essentially a platform game, with slight RPG/adventure elements (puzzles, treasure, equipment, etc.) Asha can jump, run, attack or defend (by pressing the "down" button). She can also use items and equip weapons and armor, talk to people, and open treasure chests. Later in the game, she will also be able to use magic, and a little blue pet animal will assist and help her on her journey. The combat system is very similar to the classical Zelda style. Health and mana points are measured in little hearts, and the more you progress in the game, the more hit points you gain.

The game was released only in Japan. It is sometimes erroneously called "Wonder Boy 6".</desc>

	<path>./Mutant League Football (Japan).zip</path>
	<desc>Futuristic, intergalactic war disguised as American Football, Mutant League Football was one of the most unique football games ever to hit the gaming market. It's a unique blend of sports and sci-fi, and the actual football is the good ol' smash-mouth kind, literally.

Dynamite throwing running backs, blitzing trolls, robots that bleed oil, it's all here. Opposing quarterback connecting on too many passes? Blitz him 'til he's dead. Suspect the ref's been bribed by the other side? Call a Kill Ref audible; it's a 5 yard penalty though. 

Take your pick from nineteen teams, including three All-Star teams. There are five difficulty levels and a slow/fast game speed toggle. A tournament mode awaits those who want something more than a quick game versus the computer or a friend.

There are nineteen different fields to play on, all with there own special quirks. The Hellfield is littered with mines and fire pits to put an end to a careless runner, while The Pen is a slippery sheet of ice.</desc>

	<desc>One day, a kiwi tribe was having fun and games outside the zoo, only to be kidnapped by the evil-minded Leopard Seal, who plans to sell them at the black market. Fortunately, during the kidnapping process, Tiki, leader of the tribe, managed to escape the sack, and her job is to rescue Phee-Phee and the other kiwis scattered around New Zealand, and are held in cages in various locations that include Auckland, Rotorua, Waitomo Caves, Strait Cook, and Mt. Cook. 

If Tiki doesn't rescue a kiwi in a limited amount of time, the devil will appear and try to kill her. When Tiki reaches the outskirts of each city, except Strait Cook, there is a boss waiting to meet Tiki, and kill her by using their own choice of weapons. Also making the rescue mission difficult are several nasties that attempt to throw their own weapons, like bombs and arrows, at her. To defeat these enemies, Tiki shoots at them using her crossbow and arrows. More often than not, when Tiki shoots at enemies, they will leave behind pieces of fruit that she can pick up for points. However, it is likely that Tiki may get other weapons or the letters E, X, T, E, N, and D. Collecting all these letters will result in an extra life, and as for the weapons, they include laser shots, bombs, and fireballs. 

In some levels, a few areas are located further up than just left or right, and the only way that Tiki can go up is by snatching something off the enemy that gives her the ability to fly up. Other areas are underwater, and when Tiki goes underwater, her oxygen meter decreases, so she has to rise up to the surface again to restore her oxygen levels. Apart from her own weapons, Tiki is able to squirt water at enemies if she gets to the top of the water.</desc>

	<path>./Ninja Burai Densetsu (Japan).zip</path>
	<desc>Ninja Burai Densetsu  is a 1991 strategy game by Sega for the Sega Mega Drive released exclusively in Japan.

The game plays similarly to other strategy games such as SystemSoft's Daisenryaku games and Sega's own Shining games. You are in control of a team of ninjas fighting another team. C selects a ninja/confirms an action. B cancels an action, or if no action is in progress, selects the next ninja. A opens the battle menu, which allows you to end your turn. Battles are fully automatic.

Osomatsu-kun: Hachamecha Gekijo (Nonsense Theater) is a side-scrolling action platformer based on the manga and anime created by Fujio Akatsuka, which plays similarly to Alex Kidd. The player controls the titular Osomatsu through outlandishly Japanese environments, fighting bizarre enemies, collecting ribbons to buy various items from hidden shops, and searching for his missing brothers. Each stage is made up of multiple areas; falling into holes in the ground leads to underground passages, and jumping onto flying shells leads up into the clouds.

Fortune tells that very soon, the person who will stop the evils of this pachinko parlor will appear, and Chen's daughter, Ren, sets out on her 18th birthday for Yokohama, looking for her father.

Pachinko Kuunyan is a pachinko RPG much like the Pachio-kun series. The player controls Ren as in a standard role-playing game, but rather than fighting battles, she can enter pachinko halls and play the machines. Each of the five cities has several pachinko halls, and Ren must empty out a certain number of machines before she can move on to the next city. If she runs out of balls, then the game is over.</desc>

Unlike most other fighting games, you can control only one character (Joe) in single-player mode. In two-player mode, you can choose to fight as any of the seven available fighters, and also choose a scenery. The game plays like a standard 2D fighter: you can punch, kick, and jump on you opponents, but the fights are not entirely 2D, since you can also take a few steps vertically.</desc>

The game is a platformer with heavy shooting elements and consists of 10 levels. Many enemies stand in RoboCop's way and must be destroyed via 8 different weapons. RoboCop begins the game with only a basic pistol, but other weapons can be found, including flame and grenade throwers, laser guns, self-seeking missiles and others. While all guns have unlimited ammo, only two can be carried at the same time and being killed means the currently equipped gun is lost.

The game is evenly split between present and future levels. Enemies in present Detroit include mostly street punks and other criminal elements while the future is of course populated by deadly machines: Terminators, robotic dogs and spiders and many automated guns. Each level ends with a boss battle, featuring Terminators, heavy tanks and RoboCop's famous adversaries ED-209 and Cain (aka RoboCop 2).

	<desc>Fire Shark takes place around a small island in the South Pacific.  It is a continuously-scrolling aerial shooter with a top-down view.  Your World War II era biplane has been modified to shoot lasers and drop powerful bombs. 

There are ten levels in the game in which you will face aerial, aquatic, and ground enemies. They all fire scores of missiles at you in an attempt to knock you from the sky. 

In between levels, your plane will land on a runway for refueling and maintenance. You will receive bonus points for the number of bombs left in your hold and the number of lightning bolt icons you picked up in the prior level.

There are also many power-ups available in each level. Slow-moving blimps contain a power-up icon which is revealed after the zeppelin explodes. Other icons appear when various other enemies or buildings are destroyed. These power-ups will float around the screen for several seconds. Grabbing them with your plane earns you a weapon upgrade or bonus points.

The standard weapons are the bomb and the Wide Shot. As power-ups are obtained the number of shots per blast can increase up to 16. The Wide Shot is a comparatively weak weapon that usually requires multiple hits to take an enemy down.

The Shark Beam is a green laser that fires in a spiral pattern and the strongest weapon of all is the Super Fire. It will fire continuously while the fire button is held. Power-ups increase its beam count to 4.</desc>

The game is a first person RPG, with turn-based combat and cartoony graphics. The dialogue is displayed via dialog bubbles appearing above the characters speaking, although the protagonist never speaks. There are no sub-quests - the secrets in the game involve the location and use of special metal for forging esoteric items. There are about 25 to 30 hours of gameplay to be found here, before the final battle and ending sequence.</desc>

	<desc>Humans on Earth have lost their righteous ways. After seeing that this has happened, the Gods have decided to abandon the Earthlings and no longer protect them. Ashura, the King of an alien race hailing from the Evil World, decides that this is the perfect time to strike the vulnerable unprotected Earth.  It just so happens that one of the good gods, Hyperion, takes pity on the humans and decides to bestow his power to four of the strongest Earth warriors so they can go and defeat Ashura and his minions.

The player takes control of these four warriors who are Leo, a fencer, Marco, a monk, and Horatio and Tiffany, whom are both ninjas (one male, one female). Each character fires their own type of weapon and each character can charge up their weapon to make it a more powerful shot. All the characters also have a special weapon that can clear all the enemies on the screen but with the caveat that it can only be used once per stage. Each character also has a jump and speed attribute which when powered up allows them to jump higher and walk faster. Players can switch between all of the characters during a stage.

The game has 9 different stages. The player can play the first six (mountain,harbor,street,future,glen, and forest) in any order. Each round ends with a boss which must be defeated to clear that round.</desc>
	<path>./Shogi no Hoshi (Japan).zip</path>
	<desc>Shogi no Hoshi is a digital version of the ancient Japanese game shogi, which is a board game that plays much like chess. The game is a standard shogi game for one player. There is a standard versus-computer mode with six different play levels, as well as a bizarre Adventure mode which follows a young boy named Kinta whose mother is trying to get him to become the greatest shogi player in Japan.</desc>

	<desc>Tsukumo Mutsu, a young student of Karate, has come to the city seeking the Jinmukan dojo, looking for a challenge to prove himself. He's gotten lost, but a young girl helps him out. She happens to be the granddaughter of the head of the dojo, and doesn't want him to get involved with the place, but Tsukumo insists on continuing regardless. He walks right in, and takes on the first guy in a karate gi he comes across...

Shura no Mon is a so-called "command action" game based on the manga by Masatoshi Kawahara. The player controls Tsukumo by selecting commands from a list, using different attacks and defensive maneuvers at the appropriate time, with the results shown via brief animated sequences. Between bouts, lightly-animated visual scenes progress the story. The plot closely follows the first arc from the manga, starting with Tsukumo's arrival at the legendary Jinmukan dojo.</desc>

	<desc>Hanamichi Sakuragi is your average high school delinquent; sporting a bright red pompadour and continually being shot down by every girl he approaches, he jumps at the chance to impress a cute girl named Haruko by joining his school's basketball team. While at first not knowing the difference between a slam dunk and a Sherman tank, he slowly becomes an important part of the Shohoku High School team, which fights against the odds on the road towards the regional championships.

Slam Dunk: Kyogo Makko Taiketsu! (Champion Front Showdown!) is a five-on-five basketball game based on the anime and manga created by Takehiko Inoue. Following the story, starting from the first exhibition matches, the player can take control of either a single player or the whole Shohoku team in an arcade-style basketball game. The game uses a side-view for the center court, and zooms in for a head-on view when near the basket. There is also an exhibition mode for up to five players, where six different school teams from the series are available for play.

	<desc>At first glance, Slap Fight MD is a direct conversion of the 1986 arcade classic Slap Fight from Toaplan and Taito, featuring a faithful conversion of the original title with several difficulty settings, as well as both original and arranged soundtracks. However, also included on the cartridge is a completely new sequel with all-new stages, bosses, graphics, and music. The basic gameplay is identical: a vertically-scrolling shooter where power-ups cycle through a list to choose from, and it is possible to construct massively-wide ships with incredible firepower. Slap Fight MD also adds the ability to jettison your ship's power-ups causing a massive screen-filling explosion that can potentially save your life.</desc>
	<path>./Snow Bros.zip</path>
	<desc>Nick and Tom are two Princes living the dream with two beautiful princesses. When suddenly the evil King Scorch freezes Prince Nick and Tom and kidnaps the Princesses. Now Nick and Tom find themselves with abilities dealing with snow and ice. These two Snow Brothers will need to hunt down the evil King Scorch and rescue the princesses.

Snow Bros. is a fixed-screen platform game where players must defeat all enemies on each level (screen), 50 altogether. The Snow Bros use snow as their weapon, throwing it at the enemies to stun them. When lots of snow is thrown at an enemy, it becomes covered in a flurry and unable to move. These can be rolled into giant snowballs and pushed or kicked into other enemies. If left alone, enemies will eventually defrost and become angry at the player. The enemy filled snowballs are a much stronger weapon then the regular handful of snow and are the only effective weapon Nick and Tom have against the bosses.</desc>
	<path>./Sokoban (J).zip</path>
	<desc>Shove It! The Warehouse Game is a top-down puzzle game based on the original gameplay of Soko-Ban Hiroyuki Imabayashi wrote for Thinking Rabbit. The player controls Stevedore, a warehouse keeper, from a top-down view. As shown on the title screen, shoving boxes will earn him money to make his dreams come true, a lovely girlfriend and a fiery red sports car.

The game consists of 16 stages with 10 rounds each. At a certain stage, any of the 10 rounds can be selected while playing but a new stage will only be opened up when all rounds have been successfully completed. To complete a round, Stevedore needs to push all boxes on the designated spots. This will turn them into a different colour. This is no easy task as the level design will obstruct many moves and cornered boxes can no longer be moved. While playing it is possible to restart the round, undo the last step and the game keeps track of the number of steps taken.

The game supports passwords and includes an edit mode where new levels can be designed and played.</desc>

	<path>./Sonic Eraser (Japan).zip</path>
	<desc>Sonic Eraser is a puzzle game very similar to Columns that features Sega mascot Sonic the Hedgehog. Pieces in different arrangements drop into a well; if two or more matching pieces touch, they disappear and the above pieces fall to take their place. There are four different single-player game modes:

1. Round: Each stage starts with pieces in the well already. There are several spinning green pieces, which must all be destroyed to finish the stage.

2. Normal: A standard endless mode in which the game speed continually rises as matches are made.

3. Doubt: No white-colored blocks will appear in the drop formations, but often a random block in the formation will change to a white block after it is placed.

4. Block: Similar to Normal mode, but blocks will not fall out of formation until a match is made, allowing for impressive clear combos.

These modes can be played either single player or two-player simultaneous on separate fields. There is also a versus mode for one or two players, in which creating a combo of three or more clears will attack the opposing player, which causes them to lose control of their pieces for a short time.</desc>

	<desc>The evil doctor Robotnik has a new plan to take over the world. He has built a new weapon, the Veg-O-Fortress on Mount Mobius and with it, he is transforming all creatures into robots. Sonic sneaks into the fortress and tries to stop Robotnik.

</desc>
	<path>./Sonic the Hedgehog (Japan).zip</path>
	<desc>Sonic the Hedgehog is the first of many games starring Sega's premier rodent, Sonic. It's a side scrolling platform game with a difference: speed. Sonic rushes through levels with incredible speed, allowing him to traverse loops and jumps with ease. 

The plot of the game is simple. The evil Dr. Robotnik has captured many of Sonic's animal friends, and trapped them inside robots. Fortunately, Sonic can free his friends by destroying the robots with his spin attack. Meanwhile, Dr. Robotnik is trying to control the all-powerful chaos emeralds. Sonic must grab them before he does in the 3D rotating bonus levels. 

Sonic's weapon is his spin attack; while jumping, Sonic destroys hostile robots by touch. Throughout the platforming levels, Sonic collects numerous rings. If Sonic is hit by an enemy, all the rings he's carrying fall out and scatter around; Sonic can quickly grab the rings back before they disappear. If Sonic is hit while not carrying any rings, he dies. Collecting 100 rings gives Sonic an extra life. There is also an invincibility bonus which temporarily protects Sonic from all attacks. 

The game is divided into several "zones", each of them containing three levels. At the end of each zone Sonic confronts Dr. Robotnik in a boss fight. 

Sonic the Hedgehog is a significant game because it gave Sega it's first real mascot, and established the Genesis as the video game system with "attitude."</desc>
	<path>./Sonic the Hedgehog 3 (Japan).zip</path>
	<desc>Dr. Robotnik's Death Egg has crash-landed on Floating Island, so called because it harnesses the power of the Chaos Emeralds to float in the air.  Robotnik needs them to repair the Death Egg, so he tells the guardian of Floating Island, Knuckles the Echidna, that Sonic and Tails are there to steal them. With Knuckles tricked and trying to stop the heroes at every turn, will they be able to stop Robotnik in time?

Sonic the Hedgehog 3 is the third in the Sonic series of games. As with the previous games, it is a side-scrolling platformer based around speed. The basic game remains the same - players collect rings to earn extra lives, which are also used for protection, and scatter everywhere when Sonic is hurt. Sonic can jump on enemies to defeat them, and Spin Dash by holding down and the jump button, then letting go of down.

New to Sonic 3 are three different types of shields - the Fire Shield (which protects you from fire but disappears if you enter water), the Water Shield (which lets you breathe underwater infinitely) and the Electric Shield (which pulls nearby rings towards you). Sonic can use extra abilities when he has these shields by pressing jump while in the air - either a horizontal fireball dash, a vertical bubble bounce, or an electric double jump. If Sonic has no shield active, he can activate a brief energy shield, also by pressing jump in the air. Tails cannot use the shields' special abilities, but he can instead either fly or dog paddle (in water) for a limited time. He can also carry Sonic with him while doing so.

There are now two types of bonus stages - one is available by collecting 50 or more rings, running past a checkpoint lamppost and then jumping into the stars (as you could in Sonic the Hedgehog 2. This stage give you the chance to earn bonus rings, lives and power-ups. In this stage, there is a giant gumball machine. By hitting the crank, you'll spit out a bonus item that can either be rings, lives or bonus shields. The stage is over when you fall down the bottom of the screen.

The other, more important, Special Stage can be accessed by jumping into giant rings that are hidden away in secret areas in each level. In these stages, you must collect all the blue spheres while avoiding the red ones (which end the stage early). Collecting all of the outer blue spheres around square or rectangle sphere formations will turn them all into rings - if you collect 50 or more in this stage, you can earn a continue. Once you collect all the blue spheres in the stage, it clears and you earn one of the seven Chaos Emeralds.

Sonic 3 features six different Zones, which are made up of two Acts. At the end of each Act is a boss that must be defeated to complete the stage and rescue Sonic's animal friends that Robotnik has captured to turn into Badnik robots. The zones in Sonic 3 are approximately three times bigger than those in Sonic 2, and feature multiple, branching paths.

As with Sonic 2, there is a two-player Vs. Mode, which plays in a split-screen horizontal style. There are special monitor pick-ups in this mode which do things like swap player positions, lose rings, or cause a Badnik to appear. You can also race against the clock in a time trial mode.</desc>
	<path>./Sorcer Kingdom (Japan).zip</path>
	<desc>Sorcerer's Kingdom is a mix of RPG and strategy game. You play a young adventurer, who is sent out by the king to find out the reason for the increasing number of monsters that threaten the land and restore peace to the kingdom. Starting out as an Adventurer you are eventually given higher titles by the king, as a reward for completing quests. 

The game plays like a typical RPG but the battles are a little unusual. Whenever you are attacked or attack a monster that is within your current range, a turn-based battle starts immediately without taking you to a separate fighting area, and you have to fight all enemies that were visible the moment the battle started.</desc>
	<path>./Sorcerian (Japan).zip</path>
	<desc>Sorcerian is the fifth game in the Dragon Slayer series. It is set in the fantasy land known as Pentawa, whose inhabitants are in constant need of protection from ferocious creatures roaming the wilderness. The king of Pentawa hires a party of adventurers, and their first assignment is to retrieve a precious sceptre from a dungeon, where it is guarded by the evil demonic lord Ouks.

The game is an RPG with an unusual side-scrolling perspective and action-based combat, somewhat of a cross between Wizardry and platform games. Despite being a Japanese game, Sorcerian resembles Western RPGs of its time, focusing more on character development than story. In the beginning, the player creates a party of four characters, choosing between fighter, wizard, elf, and dwarf (races and classes are not distinguished). Beside the usual inns and shops, there are many things that can be done in the towns of the game, including complex development of magical spells (up to 120 spells of different disciplines), training to raise personal skills (strength, intelligence, etc.), enchanting weapons with elemental magic, as well as looking for part-time jobs.

The view switches to side-scrolling when the party ventures into a hostile area. Combat is performed in real time, with the player controlling the entire party at once. The lead character can be changed at any time, and battle actions will be carried out by whoever is in front. Melee attacks and magic spells are unleashed by pressing corresponding buttons. The characters can also jump and interact with objects by bumping into them. Dungeons are usually maze-like, and some contain simple puzzles such as finding and activating hidden switches to open doors.</desc>

There is no scenario mode, and any of the included maps can be played. Some maps are for two players, some for four, and any map can be played with any combination of human and computer players.

The game is played on a large map made up of hexagonal spaces, each of which is a specific type of terrain. Each player controls a number of units, which each take up one space on the grid. Different units have different strengths and weaknesses toward other units, which are also affected by the terrain. Each player controls a capital, and the goal is to capture the other players' capitals.</desc>

Gameplay is identical to the previous games, you control Opa-Opa on a freely scrolling 2D game world and you must seek and destroy all the enemy generators in each level in classic arcade shooter fashion and then face a boss fight. Upon successful completion of a level, you get to spend the coins you collected on it at an upgrade shop, fitting your ship with better weapons and upgrades, and then you head out for the next level.

Small changes in gameplay include the removal of the automatic orientation control as in the Game Gear Fantasy Zone, expanded control mapping that takes advantage of the Mega Drive's extra buttons, and more weapons and items to upgrade your ship with.</desc>

Once on the field, game play follows standard baseball rules. The password feature enables you to take your team all the way through a season to the World Series. The game also tracks all of the other teams in the league simultaneously.

Batters in the game are rated according to batting average, home runs, running speed, and fielding and throwing ability. Pitchers are rated by ERA, curve-throwing ability, stamina, top throwing speed, and the distance a hit pitch will travel. All the ratings make this game a challenge to your managerial ability as well as your gaming skill because you're calling the shots from the dugout.

Decide whether there'll be fielding errors and determine how the wind will affect the hit balls. This game covers about every detail, right down to umps who shout "safe" or "out."</desc>

In addition to the now-defunct online mode, it can be played single-player offline with an exhibition match, as well as a "pennant mode" where the player builds their own team and plays through a full season. There is also the option to watch a computer-controlled match.</desc>
	<path>./Tetris (Japan).zip</path>
	<desc>Tetris is one of many conversions of the famous block-stacking game, this one is based on the 1988 coin-op version produced by Sega. The goal is to place pieces made up of four tiles in a ten-by-twenty well, organizing them into complete rows, which then disappear. As rows are cleared, the pace of the game increases and the background changes, and the game ends if the stack reaches the top of the well.

In addition to a standard endless mode for one or two players, the game also includes a "time trial" mode for one or two players, where the goal is to get as many points as possible in three minutes. There is also a "doubles" mode, where two players work together to fill lines in an extra-wide well, each controlling their own pieces simultaneously.

The game offers a number of standard options: setting the starting level, how much "garbage" is at the bottom of the well when the game starts, and whether the next piece is visible. There are also optional "item blocks," which are special flashing pieces that give an extra bonus if they are used to clear a line.</desc>

	<path>./Time Dominator 1st (Japan).zip</path>
	<desc>A fast-paced platform game in the vein of the classic Sonic the Hedgehog. The evil overlord Time Dominator has constructed a time machine and is using it to steal treasures from the past, creating a warp in the flow of time. The Time Warp Patrol, created to prevent this sort of thing from happening, sends the special time-traveling duck Socket (or Minutes in the Japanese version) to fix the flow of time and stop Time Dominator.

Socket has reasonably basic abilities: he can jump, kick to the side or straight upward, and run quite fast. As Socket is a robot, his energy level continually drains from simply being in operation; thankfully, there are a liberal amount of electric bolts strewn about each stage, which will refill his health when picked up. Getting hit by enemies will take a chunk out of his life bar.

There are seven different themed zones, each with four separate parts. First up is the High Speed Zone, which is a gateway level leading to the next zone, and as the name suggests it encourages high speed play. Next is the Athletic Zone, which generally entails lots of jumping, and the Labyrinth Zone, which is focused on exploration and simply finding a path to the exit. At the end of each Labyrinth Zone, Socket faces off against Time Dominator in a boss round, then moves on to the next High Speed Zone.

The game also features a sound test mode and a time trial mode, where the High Speed Zone stages can be played without any enemies present with times being recorded.</desc>

The game lets the player choose whether to play on a US or Japanese golf course. Once out on the course, the player must choose which golf club to use, where to make contact with the ball, and where to aim in the direction they want the ball to go. Once that's decided the player fills a swing meter and hits the ball trying to get the ball into the hole.</desc>

	<desc>Atlantal, a peaceful planet, has been attacked by an invading alien fleet known only as The Aggressors, leaving the capital city Delila in ruins. In order to sop The Aggressors, the people of Atlantal send the most powerful fighter ship on the planet, the bio-ship Gomorrah.

Uchu Senkan Gomorrah (Space Battle Ship Gomorrah) is a horizontally-scrolling shooter based on the 1990 coin-op of the same title.

Additionally, there are several power-ups that can be found, including speed-ups, additional mounted guns, and the life-up, which will not only increase the ship's armor, but also cause it to grow in size as well.

The game features 9 stages, each with a boss at the end, as well as one or two-player simultaneous play. The game difficulty has been rebalanced from the arcade to compensate for the lack of a trackball to control the aiming cursor; the player must stop their ship in order to move the cursor.

	<path>./V-Five (Japan).zip</path>
	<desc>This cartridge combines two different localized flavours of the original arcade game. There are two modes, Grind Stormer and V Five. Both offers the same levels and enemies, but have a different approach to how the player can use power-ups.

In this hectic, top-down, vertically-scrolling shooter where the screen is constantly filled with enemies and bullets, players have a constant, unlimited firing rate, enhanced by power-ups that include missiles, target-seeking bullets, shields, additional speed, extra power and bonus points. In Grind Stormer the ship always moves at a fast speed and the player can collect bombs that damage the entire screen and fend off bullets. The other variant V Five takes a Gradius-approach to power-ups, having the player advance through a selection of power-ups shown on the right by collecting tokens. In the first mode power-ups are immediately applied. In the second mode the ship is much slower and the player needs to decide to spend tokens on speed power-ups right away or save them to advance to seeking bullets or additional power.

The game difficulty, amount of lives and continues can be set in the options. After using a continue, the player immediately receives a "Special" power-up granting four wingmen.</desc>

	<desc>Wonder Boy III: Monster Lair is a quite different game to most of the games in the Wonder Boy series. You play a green-haired dude who must attack the invaders that attempt to collect weapons and use them to destroy the land. The game starts out like a simple platform game, but it's just when Wonder Boy enters the skull further on that the game is transformed into a shoot 'em up, so basically the gameplay consists of action and shooter scenes.

In the action scenes, your vitality decreases as you make your way towards the skull, but this can be restored by collecting fruit. A wide variety of weapons can be picked up, and not only does these allow you to use the weapons for a limited amount of time, but they also increase your vitality. 

In the shooter scenes, you ride your pink friend as you make your way through the scene. Here, your vitality remains static unless you are hit by an enemy passing by. As usual, there is a boss waiting for you at the end which you must defeat. Every boss changes color to show how much damage has been done to it. You have to defeat some bosses in two stages.

If your vitality gets low in each scene, you'll lose a life. You can also choose to have Wonder Girl join you, as two players can play the game.

	<path>./Zan Yasha Enbuden (Japan).zip</path>
	<desc>Zan: Yasha Enbukyoku is a turn-based strategy game set in feudal Japan.

The background for the game's events is the ongoing battle between noble warriors, known as yasha, and demons. Between the two stand the "middle people", i.e. other Japanese generals and rulers. The player can choose to play as either yasha, demonic, or "middle" army. 

The player has to manage his army, deploying units for protection and attack, as well as negotiating with other rulers. Events such as earthquakes, plagues, etc. occur randomly. Diplomacy doesn't always work, so battles against enemy armies occupy a large portion of the game. The battles are somewhat similar to those of turn-based RPGs (though the game has no RPG elements): the player chooses commands from a menu, such as attack, use magic, use special technique, use a battle formation, etc. There is no active movement during the battles. The outcome of the battle depends on the chosen commands as well as on the strength of the units.</desc>

Apple's only method of attack is throwing enormous 16 ton weights (thus the title), which can and will crush enemies in a bloody mess. However, these weights will bounce off each other, so the player must be careful to not let Apple get crushed himself. They are also not entirely unlimited, as the player can only hold five at once, and they must be allowed to recharge when Apple runs out. Enemies on each stage will appear from the top of the screen in waves, through a randomly cycling "slots" meter, and once all slots and enemies have been cleared, the player moves on to the next stage.</desc>

	<desc>Alisia Dragoon is the female protagonist of this fast-paced platform game. Alisia must destroy an evil demon and avenge her fathers death through eight stages. She has only one weapon to dispose of enemies: thunder magic. This magic is auto-aiming and can track multiple targets. However, the game is quite hard as the levels are loaded with fantasy-inspired monsters. Using thunder magic reduces a magic gauge, meaning you often have to wait for it to recharge. Once fully charged Alisia can unleash a massive rolling blast of lightning across the screen.

During the game, you can improve your magic by picking up potions. There are also four monsters which accompany Alisia: Dragon Frye, Ball O'Fire, Thunder Raven and Boomerang Lizard. Each has different abilities, deciding which, if any, to use in a given situation is part of the challenge. These monsters, like Alisia herself, are fully upgradeable with power-ups. They can also die if weakened too much, forcing you to hunt for a reviving power-up. You can pause the game and select your companion at any time.</desc>

The upper one can move and turn, allowing you to hit the ball from different angles and from different parts of the screen. You advance through levels by destroying bricks and enemies, going up until the level boss enemy appears.</desc>

	<desc>Streets of Rage, Sega's answer to Final Fight, follows the story of three young police officers (Adam Hunter, Axel Stone and Blaze Fielding) in a city controlled by a criminal syndicate led by a "Mr. X" where crime is rampant, which leads the three heroes to make a pact to leave the force and topple the syndicate by themselves.

Gameplay is straightforward and simple. Three buttons are used, one to jump, other to attack and another to perform a range attack from a support police car. Each character has a limited set of moves that include punching and kicking or performing a back attack (if in the open), two grapple moves (depending if holding the opponent in front or by the back), a flying attack, and if playing with another player two additional tag attacks, and different abilities: Adam is slow, but a good jumper and a hard hitter, Axel fast and also a hard hitter, but a lousy jumper and Blaze fast and a good jumper, but weak hitter.
Levels are in typical arcade side-scroller fashion: move from left to right (with two exceptions), clearing screens from enemies one after another as fast as possible while avoid taking damage with a boss in the end. Some levels feature "death drops" where the player must avoid falling, while throwing enemies there at the same time, including a typical elevator level. Several items are scattered on the ground, from melee weapons and bonus points (and lives or additional police cars) to apples and turkeys (to restore health).</desc>

Now, Axel, Blaze, Sammy, and Axel's good friend Max, a pro wrestler, must head out to stop Mr. X once again...hopefully for good...

Streets of Rage 2 differs from the previous title in several ways. There are changes in both graphics (characters now are bigger, more detailed and with more animation frames, and scenarios are less grainy) and gameplay (the rocket move was replaced by a special move that doubles in offense and defense along several new moves), along other new features such as life bars (and names) for all enemies and the radically different new characters.</desc>

	<desc>In part three of the Streets of Rage series, Mr. X is back and this time his plan involves replacing public officials with his own robots. Only Axel, Blaze, Skate, and new-comer Dr. Zan can stop him. Streets of Rage 3 features all of the beat 'em up action you would expect from a Streets of Rage game. One new feature is the special move power bar, where it only costs energy to do a special move if the bar isn't full. Also new is the ability to do special maneuvers with different weapons, depending on the character. For example, Skate has no special move with the pipe, but does have one with the knife. The opposite is true for Axel. Any weapon Dr. Zan picks up is turned into energy balls which he can throw at the enemies. Secret characters and multiple endings add replay value.</desc>
	<path>./Batman (Japan).smd</path>
	<desc>The Genesis version of Batman: The Video Game follows closely the plot from the 1989 movie.

The game consists in six stages, four of side-scrolling platform action and two side-scrolling shooter ones, in the following order: Gotham City Street, Axis Chemical Factory, Flugelheim Museum, Gotham City Street (with the Batmobile and after that on foot), In the Sky over Gotham City (with the Batwing) and the Cathedral, where Batman finally faces the Joker.

Batman can beat his enemies by punching them, slide kicking (by pressing down and the B button) or throwing his Batarang. By holding down the B button, Batman will block projectile-based attacks. He can also use his double jump (pressing the C button a second time while ascending) to leap greater distances or attack his enemies. To reach higher platforms, Batman can use his Grappling Hook (by pressing up and C to shoot, C again to climb). While piloting the Batmobile or the Batwing, Batman can shoot the Twin Vulcan Cannons (B button) or Twin Homing Missiles (A button).

Through the levels, Batman will collect Batman emblems (which will give him Batarangs or Twin Homing Missiles, depending on the stage played), Hearts (which give him health) and Batman heads (which give him an extra life).

	<path>./Battle Golfer Yui (Japan).smd</path>
	<desc>Gil Hazard, president of the Hazard Foundation, is secretly Professor G, the leader of the evil Dark Hazard organization. He has designs on world domination, and has plans to use the power of golf toward this end; this is the Battle Golfer project. Yui Mizuhara and Ran Ryuzaki are two ordinary high school girls who just so happen to be golf prodigies, and so are prime candidates for the Battle Golfer project. They are abducted by Professor G, but are rescued by a mysterious man before they can be taken under his control. Having escaped, Yui hears about a golf tournament being held by the Hazard Foundation, and suspecting more nefarious plans, she secretly enters the tournament to stop him for good.

Battle Golfer Yui is a unique genre fusion between a golf game and a Japanese-style adventure game. The main adventure mode casts the player as Yui competing in the Hazard Cup tournament. The player can interact with other characters on the course, and will need to defeat several different opponents at match play on oddly-themed courses in order to proceed. The system is quite simple and fast-paced; simply choose a direction, a club, spin, and hit the bar with the right timing to adjust shot power. Each character also has special abilities to help them out, but these are limited in use. There is also a regular golf mode for one or two players, offered as both stroke and match play.</desc>

During close combat, pressing the A or C button rapidly will result in a throwing or choking attack. There is no visible health bar, but three icons are displayed at the bottom of the screen. Once a dragon is knocked down for a longer moment, one icon turns red. Once all icons are red, the fight is lost. The battle arena is surrounded by an electric fence, that opponents can be thrown into and which can also be used to initiate jump attacks.

There are two modes of play: Match and Tournament. Match is a single match for one or two players, where several different dragons are available. Tournament sees the player starting out with a week dragon who has to fight increasingly difficult battles and increase his stats (Power, Speed and Stamina). After every other battle, a shop can be visited that offers different items including food that increases Power, Speed or Stamina, Data Disks that contain information on other Dragons and more. After visiting the shop, Dragons can be trained. The training consists of simply selecting an attribute to be increased. At a few points in the game, it is possible to splice the player's Dragon's genes which that of a defeated Opponent to gain different abilities.</desc>

	<path>./Blue Almanac (Japan).smd</path>
	<desc>In the distant future, mankind has long left the Earth and spread all over the Milky Way. Humans settled down on different planets, sometimes coming into contact with other races, and established a connection between them. The player is a nameless young man who was a mere child when he survived a spaceship crash and had to seek shelter on a new planet. Now he is sixteen, and his parents send him as a foreign student to the planet Terra. That is where his adventure begins!

	<path>./Boogie Woogie Bowling (Japan).smd</path>
	<desc>Championship Bowling is a standard bowling game for one or two players, and the only one available for the Genesis. The player picks one of four different bowlers and the ball they want to use, then heads out to the lanes. The player controls the throw, spin, and power by stopping bars at the right time.

The game includes three different play modes: standard bowling; spare mode, where a handful of pins are placed with the goal being to pick up a spare; and bonus mode, where specific pins are worth different amounts of points. Each mode can be played against either the computer or a friend, and there are three different lane types available. There is also a practice mode for each of the game types.

The Japanese version, Boogie Woogie Bowling, is largely the same but features different, more anime-style characters to play as (including a robot for no explained reason), as well as minor tweaks to the timing for throws.</desc>
	<path>./Burning Force (Japan).smd</path>
	<desc>In this game, you play the role of Hiromo, a blue-haired girl who roams the skies on her trusty red airbike. One day, during a routine patrol, she discovered aliens have attacked the Earth. Of course, it is up to our heroine to go on a solo mission, flying in her airbike around the Earth, fighting regular enemies and bosses, and ultimately saving the planet.

This is a pseudo-3D scrolling shooter similar to Space Harrier. The game is viewed from behind-the-character perspective. You can use regular fire attacks or limited super-powerful shots that do big damage.</desc>
	<path>./Chelnov (Japan).smd</path>
	<desc>One windy day, there was an explosion at a nuclear power station, causing heavy doses of radiation to be poured over many people. One of these people was a young scientist named Chelnov. When he survived the deadly accident, he was possessed with abnormal powers. Having realized this, he decided to act in the cause of justice. He is determined to escape the Eastern Bloc country he called home and run and jump across the world to finish in the US.

What distinguishes Chelnov from other platform games is its use of forced scrolling. This occurs when the screen moves continuously from left to right, forcing players to negotiate the game's many obstacles and enemies without controlling Chelnov's speed of progress. Enemies attack from left, right, above, and below, and Chelnov can switch the direction he's facing to attack enemies that are behind him. Some enemies in the game carry different types of weapons and power-ups, and when they are shot at, the power-ups drop to the ground and can be picked up.</desc>

The game ends when the goal has been reached a set number of times, and the winner is the player with the most happiness at the end of the game. Up to four players can play, with the computer taking control of any remaining characters.</desc>

After finding what he's looking for, Shin-chan will move on to the next area.

Also included is a minigame mode with eight different minigames, such as a bubble-blowing contest, a three-legged race, and a desperate search for clothing before school. The entire game, including the minigames, is filled with dialogue containing the same humor as the source material.

	<path>./Daikoukai Jidai II (Japan).smd</path>
	<desc>In the first Uncharted Waters game, it was the 15th century and the New World was discovered. Now in New Horizons, it is the early 16th century and the age of exploration and sea trade is underway. Players choose from any one of six adventurers (scenarios), each with their own distinctive but intertwining plot, to embark on a quest of sailing, seamanship and exploration. The six characters are:

1. Joao Franco is the son of Duke Leon Franco, the hero of the first Uncharted Waters game and an influential man in Portugal. His father wants to make him into a strong man and so decides to send him out to sea. Young Joao is tasked with learning the skills of the sailor (he is the only character who starts at level one) and embarking on a quest of discovery; reaching the far east and eventually looking for the secret of Atlantis.

2. Catalina Erantzo is a Spanish naval officer who believes her beloved and her brother were both murdered by the Portuguese armada. Vowing revenge she turns to a life of piracy and soon becomes a red haired scourge of the seas.

3. Pietro Conti is a indebted man, having inherited the financial woes of the Conti family. When the Duchess Franco hires him to spy on her son, he accepts the job and obtains a ship. Pietro hopes to use these resources to seek out valuable treasure and clear up his family's debt.

4. Ernst Von Bohr is a geographer who is teaching classes in Holland. But he yearns to leave the classroom and sail the high seas, living a life of adventure that he has only read about in books. When his friend, Mercator offers to finance his initial voyage in exchange for cartography information about the world, Ernst is given the opportunity to live out his dream.

5. Ali Vezas is a poor orphaned child living in Istanbul and serving others. He dreams of becoming his own master and making his own fortune across foreign lands. A twist of fate aides in providing him with small loans, with which he is able to afford his first ship and sail out with a cargo hold full of goods...

6. Otto Baynes styles himself a Royal Knight of the British Empire, in the service of his majesty the king. Promoted to Admiral of the British fleet, the kingdom is worried about the increased naval power of Spanish fleets. Otto is given a letter of marque by the king and ordered to terrorize the Spanish Fleet. Equipping himself simply at first, Otto strives to become a great Privateer in the name of King and Country.

Regardless of the character chosen, Uncharted Waters: New Horizons is a top-down sailing simulation. At sea, players control the direction of their ship, where speed is affected by the number/health of the crew, the wind and the currents. Players can navigate anywhere there is water (though some ships are not ocean worthy) and discover interesting landmarks and new ports. Upon landing at a port, the view is also top-down and the player can enter different buildings, each with unique services and goods. These include: The Inn, the Item Shop, The Shipyard, The Tavern, The Castle, The Guild Hall, The Church, The Merchant and the Harbor. It's up to the player to earn enough gold to keep the crew fed and financed and keep the fleet repaired. Primary methods of earning money are through sea trade, accepting jobs from the guild, gambling and battle with other ships.

During naval combat, the game becomes a turn-based top-down strategy game, with the player moving ships in order to obtain trajectories needed to fire cannons at enemy ships, or run alongside enemy vessels in order to board them. If the player's flagship attacks the flagship of the enemy fleet, they can challenge the opponent to a duel. If accepted, the game changes to a side-view of the two captains engaged in a fight. During this sequence, the player can only choose which fighting maneuver (strike, thrust, parry, lash) they wish to engage in.

The Dragons must now embark on a mission to avenge her death and defeat the Black Warriors for the second and final time.

The original arcade version of "Double Dragon II" was essentially an improved version of the first game. In addition to offering renewed audio and visuals, as well as new traps, moves and enemy characters, "Double Dragon II" discarded the conventional punch and kick buttons in favor of a direction-oriented attacking system similar to the original Technos beat-em-up Renegade.

The NES version offered new stages, new moves and illustrated cut-scenes, as well as a new final boss and a new ending. Unlike the first NES game, it offered 2-Player Co-Op gameplay with the option to turn off the friendly fire.

The Game Boy version of "Double Dragon II" is an English localization of a "Kunio-kun" game (the Japanese franchise which inspired "Renegade" and "River City Ransom" and has nothing to do with the arcade and NES versions.

	<path>./Dragon Ball Z - Buyuu Retsuden (Japan).smd</path>
	<desc>Dragon Ball Z: L'Appel Du Destin is a fighting game that maintains the dual screen mode previously seen in the DBZ Super Butouden series of the SNES, which allowed you to be far from the opponent yet still be able to see him by having the screen split between the two characters. This is important to note, as the most damaging attack of the game could be just executed from far away of your opponent, the energy fireball projectiles. These special attacks also need that you have your KI bar (which unlike energy one, is rechargeable) to a considerable level and the only way to block them is by means of a long button combination.

The constitution of the characters is based strictly on the Freezer and Cell sagas (Son Goku SSJ, Son Gohan SSJ2, Piccolo, Vegeta SSJ, Future Trunks SSJ, Krilin, Recoome, Ginyu, Freezer, A-18 and Perfect Cell), with special mention to Krilin, Ginyu and Recoome, who made here their first appearance in a fighting game. There are also 9 scenarios available, all of them corresponding to recognizable areas of the anime itself, some also appearing for 2 times but in different status (ie, "normal" Namek and Namek "in flames").

	<desc>The 1992 edition of Electronic Arts' basketball series centers on the 1992 Olympics in Barcelona and features the original US "Dream Team" with such legendary players as Michael Jordan, Magic Johnson, Larry Bird, David Robinson, John Stockton, Charles Barkley, Patrick Ewing and Karl Malone.

In addition to the US team there are 13 other national teams with real team rosters. There is also an "All-World" team with the best of the non-US players.

The game engine and gameplay mechanics are reused from the previous games in the NBA Playoffs series. There are new signature moves and the game features the international rules.</desc>
	<path>./Dyna Brothers (Japan).smd</path>
	<desc>Dyna Brothers is a Strategy game, published by CRI,  which was released in Japan in 1992.</desc>
	<path>./Dyna Brothers 2 (Japan).smd</path>
	<desc>Planet Jura is a green and beautiful place where dinosaurs have lived for longer than anyone can remember. One day, however, a giant black ship appears in the sky, and aliens come down to the surface and start attacking the dinosaurs. Feeling their suffering, the dinosaurs' creator, The Egg, awakens. To protect their race and their planet, the dinosaurs must fight the invading aliens, and force them to leave Planet Jura.

Dyna Brothers 2 is a real-time strategy game comparable to Populous. The player controls their small army of dinosaurs against the invading enemy alien army. There are six types of units, each of which has different skills and proficiencies. The player can order their dinosaurs to move or attack, and can also hatch new dinosaurs from The Egg. There are also environmental commands like earthquakes and lightning strikes.

The game features a practice mode, story mode, and free mode, as well as a 2-player versus mode where the second player takes the role of the alien invaders.</desc>
	<path>./Ecco the Dolphin (Japan).smd</path>
	<desc>Travel through time along with Ecco the dolphin, in the only game that could call itself a "dolphin simulator". Indeed, you can do pretty much everything a typical dolphin does, including eating fish, surfacing in order to breathe, using your biological sonar and of course, jumping out of the water to amaze your friends.

The storyline is actually deeper that one may think by looking at the box illustration. As Ecco, you are the only dolphin who managed to escape from a giant whirlpool which sucked down your entire pod. The five shining stars on your forehead show that you are the chosen one to save them. But that task will be not be an easy one, as you will have to travel through time and space with the Atlantean time machine, and meet the mystical Asterite in order to defeat the Vortex Queen.</desc>
	<path>./Ecco the Dolphin II (Japan).smd</path>
	<desc>The followup to Ecco the Dolphin, in which Ecco successfully destroyed the Vortex. Unfortunately, it turns out that the Vortex Queen followed it to the Earth and eventually destroyed the Asterite. All the world's oceans are threatened, and actually already doomed.

In order to restore the Asterite and finally defeat the Vortex Queen, Ecco will have to confront once again the tides of time, which have split into two possible futures, the regular one and the dark one dominated by the Vortex Queen.

Ecco: The Tides of Time features even better graphics than its predecessor, and introduces a new gameplay mode in which the camera follows the dolphin from behind instead of from the side.

	<path>./Eliminate Down (Japan).smd</path>
	<desc>Eliminate Down is a horizontally-scrolling shooter similar in style to Thunder Force. The player has several weapons that can be freely switched (forward shot, back shot, and missile), and can also change the speed of the ship. Enemies come from all directions, and certain waves will drop powerups, including shields and weapon upgrades. The player needs to collect five upgrades in order to improve their weaponry, but the upgrade affects all three weapons.

The game includes eight stages, most of which include both a midboss and a boss at the end, and three difficulty settings. There is also a minigame similar to Whack-a-Mole where there is a grid of ship icons, and the player must hit the rotating ships.</desc>
	<path>./Europa Sensen (Japan).smd</path>
	<desc>The game is an historical simulation of the European and North African theaters of World War II. The game allows up to two players to role-play as Army commanders for either the Axis or Allied forces. This game emphasizes the military aspects of the war and leaves diplomacy to the politicians.
</desc>
	<path>./Ex-Ranza (Japan).smd</path>
	<desc>Ranger X was released fairly late in the lifetime of the megadrive. Coming from an unknown developer it was released with little fanfare and advertising but has become one of the best demonstrations of what the genesis/megadrive is capable of.

The game is a side scrolling shooter of sorts. You control a large mech (robot) which has a smaller side-kick mech which is a bit like a car. The two can join together providing an alternate shooting mode. Whilst controlling just the main mech however, the player can shoot both forward and back by using different buttons. The mech can also use it's rocket pack to boost off of the ground and hover for a short while. Levels are not necessarily left to right moving (although for the most part they are) and the game is an interesting blend of platform game and shoot-em-up.

The game features innovative graphics given the hardware limitations - there is a 3D introduction to most levels (remembering that the console had no 3D capability and a tile-based renderer) and some levels use a line-based scrolling effect to give the impression of 3D backgrounds.</desc>
	<path>./F1 Circus MD (Japan).smd</path>
	<desc>F1 Circus '91 is a Formula 1 simulation racing game. The series did not yet feature an official license, and so just like the first game it only features generic team and driver names. The game itself plays much the same, with the overhead race view and focus on car tuning and damage. The World Championship mode has of course returned, though the managerial Constructors mode is no longer present. There is also a Free Attack mode, where any course can be freely practiced; a Training mode, where special training courses can be raced on to learn the ins and outs of the game; and a Watch mode, where the player can choose a course and watch a demonstration race.
</desc>
	<path>./F1 Hero MD (Japan).smd</path>
	<desc>Following F1 Grand Prix Nakajima Satoru, Varie produced another racing simulation using the license. This time the racing is from a first person view aping Super Monaco Grand Prix. The car setup can be modified before you take to the track

There is a Time Attack mode, allowing you to go for as fast a laptime as possible on any of the game's 20 circuits (which include the 16 tracks of the 1992 Formula 1 season), as well as a full season mode, with qualifying and the race itself. Weather can be customised in the Time Attack mode but is randomly chosen in Grand Prix mode, while you can only choose one of the D-tier teams (the 4 weakest of the 16) in grand Prix mode, but can drive for McLaren, Williams et al in Time Attack.</desc>
	<path>./Fastest 1 (Japan).smd</path>
	<desc>Fastest 1 is a Formula One racing game. The game doesn't have an official FIA license, but much like Human's Fire Pro Wrestling series, includes a number of recognizable fictionalized drivers, such as Ayrton Sesna and Satoru Inakajima. The game includes a world championship mode, where the player must start from the lowest rankings and win races to become the F1 world champion. There is also a battle mode where one or two players can race each other or against computer opponents, as well as a test run mode where the player can learn each course and try to set course records. There are a total of 16 different courses, which can be played in either dry, wet, or half-wet conditions, as well as a wide variety of vehicle settings that can be tweaked.</desc>
	<path>./Fatman (Japan).smd</path>
	<desc>An eclectic, intriguing fighting game. Choose from different alien races (including Human) with different abilities and fighting styles, purchase weapons and devices, and fight your way through multiple opponents to face the Fatman.  Some of the more innovative features include being able to place wagers on the outcome of the fight, and the phenominon of a special move being less powerful the more you use it to balance gameplay.

2 player, head-to-head combat is supported.</desc>
	<path>./Final Blow (Japan).smd</path>
	<desc>Final Blow is an action game based around the sport of boxing. You can play the fighters in a sequence of knock-out competitions, (the computer versions also include a round-robin league). Rounds last one minute, with a short break in between them. As in the real sport, your aim is to knock your opponent down for 10 seconds, by gradually weakening him with a series of punches. You can block punches, to avoid them inflicting damage onto you. The ring is of a limited size, so players can be cornered, although the referee will intervene to break the boxers up if they become entangled in a stalemate position.

The genesis version is not to be confused with the Master System game of the same name, which is entirely different.</desc>
	<path>./Fire Mustang (Japan).smd</path>
	<desc>Fire Mustang is a fast side-scrolling shooter set during World War II. The player controls a P-51D Mustang plane through different missions, with many enemies on the screen at the same time and a large aircraft as a boss at the end of every mission. The Mustang has an unlimited amount of bullets, but one hit is sufficient to lose a life. There are different power-ups to collect, providing additional fire power and new firing patterns. Regardless of the power-ups, the Mustang shoots forward and drops bombs to the ground at the same time, targeting ground troops. There is a limited amount of forgers, large blasts damaging many enemies at once.</desc>
	<path>./Fire Pro Wrestling Gaiden (J) [c][!].smd</path>
	<desc>Thunder Pro Wrestling Retsuden is a spinoff of Human's popular Fire Pro Wrestling series, and the only title in the series to appear on the Mega Drive. Like the other Fire Pro games, it is an arcade-style wrestling game featuring a roster of fictional wrestlers. The game includes a standard World Championship mode where the player picks a wrestler and fights his way to win the title. There is also an "Exciting" mode in which one or two players can play an exhibition singles or tag match against the computer or each other, an Elimination mode where each player picks a team of five wrestlers, and a "Handicap" mode where one fighter must alone take on a tag team.
</desc>
	<path>./Flintstone (Japan).smd</path>
	<desc>This is a platform game based on the famous Flintstones series. The game features many original Flintstones characters, such as Fred, Wilma, Barney, and others. Instead of the usual "save the princess" or "liberate the world" kinds of a plot, "The Flintstones" is mainly based on small quests: Fred has to retrieve a lost item, etc. The large levels are divided into smaller stages. In the end of each level there is a boss battle. The gameplay involves mostly jumping and hitting the enemies on the heads with a club. The health is measured by hearts. During the game Fred will find many useful items, including some that will increase his health level.</desc>
	<path>./Fushigi no Umi no Nadia (Japan).smd</path>
	<desc>This is one of the several games based on the animé series The Secret of Blue Water. The series (and the game) are loosely based on the stories by the famous French science fiction author Jules Verne. The game is set in 1889, a time of great inventions and technology progress unseen before. You play as Jean, a young genius scientist. In Paris he meets Nadia, an African circus performer. Nadia wears a pendant that contains magical powers, and that is why the evil Gargoyle is after her - this pendant is just the item she needs to build the ultimate weapon, the Tower of Babel. Jean will do anything to protect Nadia, and hope that his love to her, his adventurer spirit, and the power of science will eventually defeat Gargoyle!

Unlike most Japanese adventures, "Fushigi no Umi no Nadia" is a top-down, third-person perspective game, in which you actually move your character around. Nadia and other friends join Jean in a RPG-like fashion (although there is no combat in the game, different characters have their own item-based abilities you should use at certain points). There are no real puzzles in the game, but you'll often have to use your inventory items to make the game progress.

Not to confuse with other Fushigi no Umi no Nadia games (for NES, Turbo CD, etc.)!</desc>

	<desc>Gambler Jiko Chushinha: Katayama Masayuki no Mahjong Dojo is a traditional 4-player mahjong game based on the manga by Masayuki Katayama, one of many produced by Game Arts over the years. The game offers both a free play mode and a lighthearted story mode which follows Katayama's characters, a group of students who play mahjong to settle their differences. There is also a "Mahjong Dojo" mode which quizzes you on aspects of the game in order to help you learn how to play better.</desc>
	<path>./Game no Kanzume Otokuyou (Japan).smd</path>
	<desc>Game no Kanzume Otokuyou is a compilation of Sega Game Toshokan games released for the Sega Mega Drive, a "digest" version of the Mega-CD collections Game no Kanzume Vol.1 and Game no Kanzume Vol.2. It was released exclusively through the Japanese Sega Channel at some unknown time, and the current ROM we know of was presumably found on the disc containing a certain version of the Dreamcast Web Browser; this has yet to be confirmed (TODO).

	<path>./Gley Lancer (J).smd</path>
	<desc>A side-scrolling sci-fi shooter, Gleylancer casts you as Lucia, a young pilot in the Space Fleet of starfighters that hijacks the experimental Gleylancer fighter to go explore the outer borders of known space in search of her missing father. Along the way Lucia will have to shoot down dozens of enemies in standard shooter fashion, while avoiding destruction and collecting power-ups that extend her ship's energy, upgrade weapons and gather screen-clearing bombs.

The Gleylancer comes equipped with two hovering satellites that can receive weapon upgrades of their own, and can lock their positions at specific angles to increase your firepower and protect the player from enemy attacks. Features only a single-player campaign with two different endings depending on how the final stages are completed (e.g. if Lucia's father is rescued or not).
</desc>
	<path>./Golden Axe III (Japan).smd</path>
	<desc>This 'Prince of Darkness' has taken away the Golden Axe and put an evil curse over all the warriors. However, one of the heroes has their curse relieved and is sent to set things straight - lift curse off others, defeat the villian and return with the Golden Axe.

The gameplay has been expanded slightly, but is essentially the same hack n' slash as the previous games. New features to the series include new characters, new moves and junction points where you can choose which path to take.</desc>
	<path>./Gunstar Heroes (Japan).smd</path>
	<desc>Chaos has broken out on the planet Gunstar-9!!

The mad Colonel Red has discovered four crystals that imprison a deadly being known as GoldenSilver, and plans on unleashing it onto the population of the planet! He must be stopped! Enter...the Gunstar Heroes, Red and Blue!

Unleash some mad blasting action onto the Colonel's army and don't let him bring GoldenSilver to life!! The fate of Gunstar-9 is in your hands!</desc>
	<path>./Heavy Unit - Mega Drive Special (Japan).smd</path>
	<desc>In an era of frequent alien attacks, the Earth has a unified Government, which relies on a line of cyborgs known as the Heavy Dolls for defense. The greatest of these are known as the Heavy Nova, a title earned by passing a rigorous training regime.

You are taking on the simulated proving grounds, which are split into two styles of alternating action. In the first you must progress (initially purely horizontally, though later with vertical flick-scrolling as well) through a hostile environment of enemies, bombs and traps, gaining points for doing it quickly and with lots of energy left. Initially you can fly and kick as needed.

Once this section is complete, you move on to one-on-one combat of the Street Fighter 2 style. The early foes have far less energy than you begin with. As you progress through the game, you are awarded extra attacking moves, in a manner similar to Brutal: Paws of Fury</desc>
	<path>./High School Soccer - Kunio Kun (J) [!].smd</path>
	<desc/>
	<path>./Hokuto no Ken (Japan).smd</path>
	<desc>Last Battle is a side-scroller and one of the early games available for the Sega Genesis.  Basically, you are the rebel hero who single handed (or footedly) will fight an entire enemies army for freedom of your people.  Standard karate fighter side-scroller fare.</desc>
	<path>./Honoo no Toukyuuji Dodge Danpei (Japan).smd</path>
	<desc>Danpei Ichigeki is a young boy who loves dodgeball. Danpei's father was a famous dodgeball player when he was still alive, and he joins the Dodgeball Club at his elementary school. However, these kids are very serious about their dodgeball, and the road ahead isn't going to be easy for Danpei.

Dodge Danpei is a team dodgeball game, one of several based on the anime and manga created by Tetsuhiro Koshita, which plays strikingly similar to the well-known Super Dodge Ball. Each team has four main players and three support players, and attempts to knock out the opposing team's main members by throwing the ball at them in various ways. Apart from normal throws, the player can also pass to teammates, and execute special power throws which are harder to dodge or catch.

The game includes several different game modes, including the main story mode which follows the story of the anime, as well as one- and two-player exhibition matches. There is also a "league" mode which allows for a tournament of up to six teams, as well as a training mode where the game teaches the basics of how to play the game.</desc>
	<path>./Hybrid Front, The (Japan).smd</path>
	<desc>The Hybrid Front is a turn-based strategy video game, released in Japan (exclusively) for the Mega Drive.

The introduction begins with someone logging into a computer. Then, it shows a revolution that occurred sometime in the 2080s leading into a series of wars and conflict that lead up to the video game's main setting of the 26th century. Since the second half of the 21st century, the depletion of fossil fuel resources have helped to deepen the conflict on Earth...
During the 24th century, the Earth was bombarded from orbit with massive optical weapons called the Metal Hammer by an Italian consortium; major cities around the world were burned to toast. The resistance would eventually be put down by CoCoON (abbreviation for COoperation COmmunity of Orbital Negotiation). Not only they would gain the corporate hegemony of humanity, CoCoON would develop a reputation as a hostile group of corporate war hawks; constantly revolting against the peaceful coalition of the PETO (abbreviation for Pan Earth Treaty Organization).
Let the fight begins !

	<path>./Hyokkori Hyoutanjima (Japan).smd</path>
	<desc>Hyokkori Hyotanjima: Daitoryo o Mezase! ("Aim for the Presidency!") is a sugoroku-style board game for up to four players based on the popular NHK children's show Hyokkori Hyotanjima. Four characters from the show all decide they want to be the island's president, and so they set off to start campaigning.

The goal of each round is to collect the most points; points can be earned or lost based on the spaces the player lands on. The round ends when a player reaches the destination set at the start of the round, which gives a points bonus. The player with the most points after a set number of rounds is the winner.
</desc>
	<path>./Hyper Marbles (SN) (Japan).smd</path>
	<desc>In the future, even the simple kids game of marbles is high-tech and extreme. Hyper Marbles takes the basic concept of the classic kids game -- to knock the opponent's marbles out of the playfield -- and gives it a futuristic sci-fi twist. The player directs their robotic marble around the field, attempting to push their opponents into the deadly electrified walls lining the arena. Aiding in this is a jet booster, which can cause opponents to bounce quite far, but if overused will overheat and must cool down before being used again. There are ten different arenas, each with different hazards like oil slicks and moving barriers. There is a single player mode, where the goal is to destroy all enemies to move on, as well as a two-player versus mode where the goal is to destroy the other player.</desc>
	<path>./I Love Mickey &amp; Donald - Fushigi na Magic Box (Japan).smd</path>
	<desc>World of Illusion is sort of a follow-up to Castle of Illusion. Mickey Mouse and Donald Duck are taken to a magic world and have to get back home. In order to do that, they can play magical tricks and interact to each other in a 2-player mode. Like other Disney games for SEGA consoles of the same period, the game has cartoon-like graphics and is played as a side-scrolling platformer.</desc>
	<path>./I Love Mickey Mouse - Fushigi no Oshiro Dai Bouken (Japan).smd</path>
	<desc>This is the first Mickey Mouse game for Sega consoles. In this game the famous Disney character must face the dangers of weird fantasy lands such as an enchanted forest and a toy world. Mickey must rescue his girlfriend Minnie who's been kidnapped by the evil witch Mizrabel.

The game play follows the traditional 2D hop 'n' bop platform style in both 8-bit and 16-bit versions. Apart from the story and the music, which is the same, all the rest (including controls, moves, stages and, obviously, graphics), are totally different.</desc>
	<path>./Ichidant R (Japan).smd</path>
	<desc>Ichidant-R is the second game in the Puzzle &amp; Action series, and the sequel to Tant-R. Twenty new minigames are present, including rocketship assembly, a batting contest, and hitting the brakes on a speeding car.

The game once again includes an arcade mode for one or two players. This time, the player is questing to rescue a kidnapped princess from an evil knight. There is also a quest mode which plays like a simple RPG, where battles are fought via minigames. Of course, the four-player competition and free modes also make a return, rounding out the package.</desc>
	<path>./J. League Champion Soccer (Japan).smd</path>
	<desc>European Club Soccer has dozens of teams from all across Europe (around 170), and each country is represented by at least two teams. In addition to correct club names, it also has recognizable imitations of team badges and kits; although more elaborate kits (such as those worn by Juventus, FC Porto or Celtic F.C.) are simplified (Juventus have a silver shirt, Porto blue and Celtic green). Player names, on the other hand, were made by mixing names found on real squads. Portuguese teams, for instance, had a large number of Yugoslavian players in the early 1990s, and that was reflected by players with names such as Valentim Ivic (of Valentim Loureiro and Tomislav Ivic, then Boavista FC chairman and S.L. Benfica manager, respectively). Names could not be changed, and since the game lacked a battery, it does not store changes done to kits and passwords were used to resume tournaments (example of a password sheet). Rotherham United are included amongst the English clubs despite never playing in the top tier of English football, this is due to the developer, Krisalis Software, being based in Rotherham. All other clubs have played in their own country's top tier.</desc>
	<path>./J. League Pro Striker - Perfect Edition (Japan).smd</path>
	<desc>Pro Striker Perfect is an updated version of the original release that features updated player statistics and the addition of the 1993 East and West All-Star teams. It is otherwise identical to the original release.
</desc>
	<path>./J. League Pro Striker (Japan).smd</path>
	<desc>Pro Striker is the first title in Sega's early-'90s soccer franchise. It is an arcade-style soccer game similar in play to Sega's earlier World Championship Soccer. The game is viewed from a birds-eye perspective with a full field minimap on the side of the screen. The player can also make substitutions and choose from six different formations. It features an official J.Leauge license, including all ten teams and all players from the 1993 season. There is an exhibition mode, a playoff mode, and a full league mode, and up to four players can play simultaneously.
</desc>
	<path>./J. League Pro Striker 2 (Japan).smd</path>
	<desc>Pro Striker 2 is the sequel to the first title, and is a very similar soccer game to the previous year's model. The updates are largely cosmetic, with the game retaining the same top-down view and field minimap. Of course, the full 1994 J.League team and player roster is included. The exhibition, playoff, and league modes are back from the first game, as well as the all-star mode that was added in its update. Once again, up to four players can play simultaneously, and the menu system has also been greatly streamlined.
</desc>
	<path>./J. League Pro Striker Final Stage (Japan).smd</path>
	<desc>Pro Striker: Final Stage is the last title in Sega's 16-bit soccer franchise, and once again features a full J.League license, including all teams and players, and four-player simultaneous play. This entry in the franchise features a completely new game engine with a side view, rather than the aging overhead engine used previously. Each mode from the previous title has returned: exhibition, tournament, league, and all-star modes are available. There is also a new penalty kick contest mode.

	<path>./Janou Touryumon (Japan).smd</path>
	<desc>Janou Touryuumon  is a 1989 mahjong game for the PC-98 by Game Arts. Sega ported it to the Sega Mega Drive in 1993.</desc>
	<path>./Jantei Monogatari (Japan).smd</path>
	<desc>A daughter of the chair of a local high school, Yu Honjo, has been kidnapped by someone unknown. Unable to go to the police, the girl's sister, Mai, hires a private investigator to find out what happened to her. The only piece of evidence is a photograph from the night of Yu's disappearance, where the missing girl and three other students from the same school are playing a game of mahjong.

Jantei Monogatari is a hybrid of a traditional-style Japanese adventure game and a regular mahjong game. The player takes the role of the unnamed private investigator, and moves from place to place via menus, talking to different characters. The investigation happens through playing mahjong with each suspect: win and they'll tell you a bit more of what they know. At first, the investigator can only speak with the three girls in the photo, but as he wins games of mahjong against them, he gains information and experience that allow him to find new clues and talk to more suspects. The investigator will need to play against a dozen different opponents in his attempt to find out what happened to the kidnapped girl.</desc>
	<path>./JuJu Densetsu (Japan).smd</path>
	<desc>The hero of the game is a young jungle-man named Toki. One day the evil wizard Dr. Stark kidnaps his girlfriend Wanda. When Toki tries to save her, he is turned into a monkey! Now Toki has to find Dr. Stark in his palace, to rescue Wanda, and to become a human being again!

It is a platform game with a lot of various levels: jungle, underwater, volcanic caves, on the ice... Toki's only weapons are spitting on the enemies or jumping on them and crashing them. There are many possibilities to upgrade his spitting "weapon"; for example, if he finds an upgrade, he can spit fireballs. 

This game is ported from an older arcade version.</desc>
	<path>./Jurassic Park (Japan).smd</path>
	<desc>The Sega Genesis game based on the Jurassic Park movie/book differs from the games made by Ocean for other platforms. Basically, Sega's Jurassic Park is a side-scrolling action game.  You jump from platform to platform, pick up weapons and health items, and try to make it to the end of the level with all your lives intact.

This version of Jurassic Park does feature an interesting twist, however. You can play it either as Dr. Grant, or as a Velociraptor. The story and level design changes based on which character you use.</desc>
	<path>./Juuouki (Japan).smd</path>
	<desc>In this coin-op conversion, you are a hero raised from the dead by the god Zeus to rescue his daughter Athena. With a scenery inspired by Ancient Greece, you have to fight hordes of undead and demons, with a boss at the end of each level until you meet the god Neff, who holds the girl captive.

The title refers to your shapeshifting abilities. In this platformer, you can collect spirit balls by defeating two-headed wolves, allowing you to mutate into different beasts such as a werewolf, a dragon, a tiger, a bear and others depending on the version. Each form, tied to a level, comes with special abilities such as flight and powerful attacks, easily superseding the basic set of punches and kicks in your human form.

	<desc>This is a vertical platformer with horizontal wrap-around. For the entertainment of the futuristic masses, you play a criminal that has been inserted into a mechanical body with the promise that if you succeed in surviving through all the levels (there are many and they are hard), you will be set free.
You start each level at the bottom, near pooling liquid which will soon rise, at your immediate peril. Navigate the level from bottom to the exit at the top before the liquid rises and kills you. There are many other foes that fly around, causing you damage and basically annoying you to spit.
Most levels must be navigated through a series of keyed gates, doors, or portals. These shaped keys are scattered around the map and must by picked up and used only on the gates they match individually.
Twist: You can only carry one special weapon (triple shot, laser beam, or vertical shot) and one tool (key, liquid-freeze, or a red herring) at a time.
This game requires a lot of memorization of enemy movement patterns and optimum routes.
A unique feature is that when you die, you can watch a replay and take over at any point to continue your game.
You can also hit the HELP button at the start of each level to view a map, helping you plan your route.</desc>

Devil Hunter Yoko is about Yoko Mano, who was a regular girl making her way through high school--until she learned that she is the 108th successor to a line of warriors charged with defending the earth against demons. 

Every woman born into the Mano family has taken up the role of the legendary Devil Hunters, warriors who battle demons and other forces of darkness who threaten Earth. The realm of the demons (which is parallel to our world) is in cross-dimensional alignment with our own, which could cause a portal to open, allowing the demons to cross over, and launch an all-out attack. The demons are trying to destroy Yoko before she can take her rightful place as the 108th generation Devil Hunter. She must stop the demons before they can perform the ritual that will mean the end of the human race.

Mamono Hunter Yoko: Dai 7 no Keisho is a side scrolling action/platformer game along the lines of Valis. You control Yoko who is equipped with a sword, which you use to slash your enemies. Also if you hold the attack button you can create a shield which will block weak attacks. The shield can also then be thrown to attack enemies. You play through various different worlds, such as a plant type stage, a water stage, a cave stage, a snow stage, etc.

	<desc>Megapanel is a tile-based puzzle game that plays like a mixture of Tetris Attack and a traditional sliding tile puzzle. Blocks rise from the bottom of a well, and the player must slide them around in order to create a row or column of three same-color blocks. This causes the group to clear, and potentially create chains from the blocks above falling. As the game continues, the number of blocks that must be cleared to continue as well as the speed at which the stack rises will both increase.

The game includes three modes. First is training mode which explains the basics of the game. In this mode, a certain number of blocks must be cleared to complete the stage. Second is a "pin-up" mode for one player, where clearing blocks reveals parts of an image of a cute anime girl, the goal being to uncover the entire picture. Last is a two-player versus mode, where players compete to clear their blocks the fastest, and can send garbage blocks to their opponent and fill up their field. The game includes two difficulty settings, two versus modes, a sound test, and a unique mode that displays the entire game in sepia tone.</desc>

	<desc>Metal Fangs is a unique futuristic battle driving game, where the player controls a team of racers and must attempt to destroy the competing team. Each "race" is made up of two heats of two parts each, and hits or kills on the other team earns points. During each heat, each team takes one turn attacking (four vehicles on the course) and one turn defending (three vehicles on the course). The team with the most points at the end of the last heat wins a reward and moves on to the next match.

However, your team won't get very far with just its basic equipment. After choosing your team's colors and members, you must then purchase upgrades for each person: engines, fuel, AI, armor, and of course weapons. During the game, you can switch freely between each member of your team. Your vehicle automatically moves forward around the track, but you can turn, throttle, and brake in order to move closer to or escape from the other team.

After each successful match there is a game of chance where winnings can be increased. There is also a two-player simultaneous battle mode.</desc>

She can also use items and equip weapons and armor, talk to people, and open treasure chests. Later in the game, she will also be able to use magic, and a little blue pet animal will assist and help her on her journey. The combat system is very similar to the classical Zelda style.

	<desc>Futuristic, intergalactic war disguised as American Football, Mutant League Football was one of the most unique football games ever to hit the gaming market. It's a unique blend of sports and sci-fi, and the actual football is the good ol' smash-mouth kind, literally.

Dynamite throwing running backs, blitzing trolls, robots that bleed oil, it's all here. Opposing quarterback connecting on too many passes? Blitz him 'til he's dead. Suspect the ref's been bribed by the other side? Call a Kill Ref audible; it's a 5 yard penalty though. 

Take your pick from nineteen teams, including three All-Star teams. There are five difficulty levels and a slow/fast game speed toggle. A tournament mode awaits those who want something more than a quick game versus the computer or a friend.

There are nineteen different fields to play on, all with there own special quirks. The Hellfield is littered with mines and fire pits to put an end to a careless runner, while The Pen is a slippery sheet of ice.</desc>

Fortunately, during the kidnapping process, Tiki, leader of the tribe, managed to escape the sack, and her job is to rescue Phee-Phee and the other kiwis scattered around New Zealand, and are held in cages in various locations that include Auckland, Rotorua, Waitomo Caves, Strait Cook, and Mt. Cook. 

If Tiki doesn't rescue a kiwi in a limited amount of time, the devil will appear and try to kill her. When Tiki reaches the outskirts of each city, except Strait Cook, there is a boss waiting to meet Tiki, and kill her by using their own choice of weapons. Also making the rescue mission difficult are several nasties that attempt to throw their own weapons, like bombs and arrows, at her. To defeat these enemies, Tiki shoots at them using her crossbow and arrows. More often than not, when Tiki shoots at enemies, they will leave behind pieces of fruit that she can pick up for points. However, it is likely that Tiki may get other weapons or the letters E, X, T, E, N, and D. Collecting all these letters will result in an extra life, and as for the weapons, they include laser shots, bombs, and fireballs. 

In some levels, a few areas are located further up than just left or right, and the only way that Tiki can go up is by snatching something off the enemy that gives her the ability to fly up. Other areas are underwater, and when Tiki goes underwater, her oxygen meter decreases, so she has to rise up to the surface again to restore her oxygen levels. Apart from her own weapons, Tiki is able to squirt water at enemies if she gets to the top of the water.</desc>

	<desc>One day, Osomatsu's five brothers went missing. The mischievous Iyami, of course, must be behind this! With great haste, Osomatsu grabs his slingshot, and sets out to rescue his brothers and give Iyami a taste of his own medicine.

Osomatsu-kun: Hachamecha Gekijo (Nonsense Theater) is a side-scrolling action platformer based on the manga and anime created by Fujio Akatsuka, which plays similarly to Alex Kidd. The player controls the titular Osomatsu through outlandishly Japanese environments, fighting bizarre enemies, collecting ribbons to buy various items from hidden shops, and searching for his missing brothers. Each stage is made up of multiple areas; falling into holes in the ground leads to underground passages, and jumping onto flying shells leads up into the clouds. A boss waits at the end of each stage, usually just Iyami in some sort of strange disguise.

Unlike most other fighting games, you can control only one character (Joe) in single-player mode. In two-player mode, you can choose to fight as any of the seven available fighters, and also choose a scenery. The game plays like a standard 2D fighter: you can punch, kick, and jump on you opponents, but the fights are not entirely 2D, since you can also take a few steps vertically.</desc>

By uploading himself into the computer network, he becomes the seed from which the malevolent Skynet grows. Years later, in the post-apocalyptic future, RoboCop is reactivated and must help the human resistance by attacking and defeating Skynet once and for all.

The game is a platformer with heavy shooting elements and consists of 10 levels. Many enemies stand in RoboCop's way and must be destroyed via 8 different weapons. RoboCop begins the game with only a basic pistol, but other weapons can be found, including flame and grenade throwers, laser guns, self-seeking missiles and others. While all guns have unlimited ammo, only two can be carried at the same time and being killed means the currently equipped gun is lost.

The game is evenly split between present and future levels. Enemies in present Detroit include mostly street punks and other criminal elements while the future is of course populated by deadly machines: Terminators, robotic dogs and spiders and many automated guns. Each level ends with a boss battle, featuring Terminators, heavy tanks and RoboCop's famous adversaries ED-209 and Cain (aka RoboCop 2).

Some levels feature optional goals besides getting to the exit, like freeing hostages or destroying security cameras.

	<desc>Fire Shark takes place around a small island in the South Pacific.  It is a continuously-scrolling aerial shooter with a top-down view.  Your World War II era biplane has been modified to shoot lasers and drop powerful bombs. 

There are ten levels in the game in which you will face aerial, aquatic, and ground enemies. They all fire scores of missiles at you in an attempt to knock you from the sky. 

In between levels, your plane will land on a runway for refueling and maintenance. You will receive bonus points for the number of bombs left in your hold and the number of lightning bolt icons you picked up in the prior level.

There are also many power-ups available in each level. Slow-moving blimps contain a power-up icon which is revealed after the zeppelin explodes. Other icons appear when various other enemies or buildings are destroyed. These power-ups will float around the screen for several seconds. Grabbing them with your plane earns you a weapon upgrade or bonus points.

The standard weapons are the bomb and the Wide Shot. As power-ups are obtained the number of shots per blast can increase up to 16. The Wide Shot is a comparatively weak weapon that usually requires multiple hits to take an enemy down.

The Shark Beam is a green laser that fires in a spiral pattern and the strongest weapon of all is the Super Fire. It will fire continuously while the fire button is held. Power-ups increase its beam count to 4.</desc>

These can be rolled into giant snowballs and pushed or kicked into other enemies. If left alone, enemies will eventually defrost and become angry at the player. The enemy filled snowballs are a much stronger weapon then the regular handful of snow and are the only effective weapon Nick and Tom have against the bosses.</desc>

	<desc>Shove It! The Warehouse Game is a top-down puzzle game based on the original gameplay of Soko-Ban Hiroyuki Imabayashi wrote for Thinking Rabbit. The player controls Stevedore, a warehouse keeper, from a top-down view. As shown on the title screen, shoving boxes will earn him money to make his dreams come true, a lovely girlfriend and a fiery red sports car.

The game consists of 16 stages with 10 rounds each. At a certain stage, any of the 10 rounds can be selected while playing but a new stage will only be opened up when all rounds have been successfully completed. To complete a round, Stevedore needs to push all boxes on the designated spots. This will turn them into a different colour. This is no easy task as the level design will obstruct many moves and cornered boxes can no longer be moved. While playing it is possible to restart the round, undo the last step and the game keeps track of the number of steps taken.

The game supports passwords and includes an edit mode where new levels can be designed and played.</desc>

	<desc>Sonic Eraser is a puzzle game very similar to Columns that features Sega mascot Sonic the Hedgehog. Pieces in different arrangements drop into a well; if two or more matching pieces touch, they disappear and the above pieces fall to take their place. There are four different single-player game modes:

1. Round: Each stage starts with pieces in the well already. There are several spinning green pieces, which must all be destroyed to finish the stage.

2. Normal: A standard endless mode in which the game speed continually rises as matches are made.

3. Doubt: No white-colored blocks will appear in the drop formations, but often a random block in the formation will change to a white block after it is placed.

4. Block: Similar to Normal mode, but blocks will not fall out of formation until a match is made, allowing for impressive clear combos.

These modes can be played either single player or two-player simultaneous on separate fields. There is also a versus mode for one or two players, in which creating a combo of three or more clears will attack the opposing player, which causes them to lose control of their pieces for a short time.</desc>

Fortunately, Sonic can free his friends by destroying the robots with his spin attack. Meanwhile, Dr. Robotnik is trying to control the all-powerful chaos emeralds. Sonic must grab them before he does in the 3D rotating bonus levels. 

Sonic's weapon is his spin attack; while jumping, Sonic destroys hostile robots by touch. Throughout the platforming levels, Sonic collects numerous rings. If Sonic is hit by an enemy, all the rings he's carrying fall out and scatter around; Sonic can quickly grab the rings back before they disappear. If Sonic is hit while not carrying any rings, he dies. Collecting 100 rings gives Sonic an extra life. There is also an invincibility bonus which temporarily protects Sonic from all attacks. 

The game is divided into several "zones", each of them containing three levels. At the end of each zone Sonic confronts Dr. Robotnik in a boss fight. 

Sonic the Hedgehog is a significant game because it gave Sega it's first real mascot, and established the Genesis as the video game system with "attitude."</desc>
	<path>./Sonic the Hedgehog 3 (Japan).smd</path>
	<desc>Dr. Robotnik's Death Egg has crash-landed on Floating Island, so called because it harnesses the power of the Chaos Emeralds to float in the air.  Robotnik needs them to repair the Death Egg, so he tells the guardian of Floating Island, Knuckles the Echidna, that Sonic and Tails are there to steal them. With Knuckles tricked and trying to stop the heroes at every turn, will they be able to stop Robotnik in time?

Sonic the Hedgehog 3 is the third in the Sonic series of games. As with the previous games, it is a side-scrolling platformer based around speed. The basic game remains the same - players collect rings to earn extra lives, which are also used for protection, and scatter everywhere when Sonic is hurt. Sonic can jump on enemies to defeat them, and Spin Dash by holding down and the jump button, then letting go of down.

New to Sonic 3 are three different types of shields - the Fire Shield (which protects you from fire but disappears if you enter water), the Water Shield (which lets you breathe underwater infinitely) and the Electric Shield (which pulls nearby rings towards you). Sonic can use extra abilities when he has these shields by pressing jump while in the air - either a horizontal fireball dash, a vertical bubble bounce, or an electric double jump. If Sonic has no shield active, he can activate a brief energy shield, also by pressing jump in the air. Tails cannot use the shields' special abilities, but he can instead either fly or dog paddle (in water) for a limited time. He can also carry Sonic with him while doing so.

There are now two types of bonus stages - one is available by collecting 50 or more rings, running past a checkpoint lamppost and then jumping into the stars (as you could in Sonic the Hedgehog 2. This stage give you the chance to earn bonus rings, lives and power-ups. In this stage, there is a giant gumball machine. By hitting the crank, you'll spit out a bonus item that can either be rings, lives or bonus shields. The stage is over when you fall down the bottom of the screen.

The other, more important, Special Stage can be accessed by jumping into giant rings that are hidden away in secret areas in each level. In these stages, you must collect all the blue spheres while avoiding the red ones (which end the stage early). Collecting all of the outer blue spheres around square or rectangle sphere formations will turn them all into rings - if you collect 50 or more in this stage, you can earn a continue. Once you collect all the blue spheres in the stage, it clears and you earn one of the seven Chaos Emeralds.

Sonic 3 features six different Zones, which are made up of two Acts. At the end of each Act is a boss that must be defeated to complete the stage and rescue Sonic's animal friends that Robotnik has captured to turn into Badnik robots. The zones in Sonic 3 are approximately three times bigger than those in Sonic 2, and feature multiple, branching paths.

As with Sonic 2, there is a two-player Vs. Mode, which plays in a split-screen horizontal style. There are special monitor pick-ups in this mode which do things like swap player positions, lose rings, or cause a Badnik to appear. You can also race against the clock in a time trial mode.</desc>
	<path>./Sorcer Kingdom (Japan).smd</path>
	<desc>Sorcerer's Kingdom is a mix of RPG and strategy game. You play a young adventurer, who is sent out by the king to find out the reason for the increasing number of monsters that threaten the land and restore peace to the kingdom. Starting out as an Adventurer you are eventually given higher titles by the king, as a reward for completing quests. 

The game plays like a typical RPG but the battles are a little unusual. Whenever you are attacked or attack a monster that is within your current range, a turn-based battle starts immediately without taking you to a separate fighting area, and you have to fight all enemies that were visible the moment the battle started.</desc>
	<path>./Sorcerian (Japan).smd</path>
	<desc>Sorcerian is the fifth game in the Dragon Slayer series. It is set in the fantasy land known as Pentawa, whose inhabitants are in constant need of protection from ferocious creatures roaming the wilderness. The king of Pentawa hires a party of adventurers, and their first assignment is to retrieve a precious sceptre from a dungeon, where it is guarded by the evil demonic lord Ouks.

The game is an RPG with an unusual side-scrolling perspective and action-based combat, somewhat of a cross between Wizardry and platform games. Despite being a Japanese game, Sorcerian resembles Western RPGs of its time, focusing more on character development than story. In the beginning, the player creates a party of four characters, choosing between fighter, wizard, elf, and dwarf (races and classes are not distinguished). Beside the usual inns and shops, there are many things that can be done in the towns of the game, including complex development of magical spells (up to 120 spells of different disciplines), training to raise personal skills (strength, intelligence, etc.), enchanting weapons with elemental magic, as well as looking for part-time jobs.

The view switches to side-scrolling when the party ventures into a hostile area. Combat is performed in real time, with the player controlling the entire party at once. The lead character can be changed at any time, and battle actions will be carried out by whoever is in front. Melee attacks and magic spells are unleashed by pressing corresponding buttons. The characters can also jump and interact with objects by bumping into them. Dungeons are usually maze-like, and some contain simple puzzles such as finding and activating hidden switches to open doors.</desc>

There is no scenario mode, and any of the included maps can be played. Some maps are for two players, some for four, and any map can be played with any combination of human and computer players.

The game is played on a large map made up of hexagonal spaces, each of which is a specific type of terrain. Each player controls a number of units, which each take up one space on the grid. Different units have different strengths and weaknesses toward other units, which are also affected by the terrain.

Batters in the game are rated according to batting average, home runs, running speed, and fielding and throwing ability. Pitchers are rated by ERA, curve-throwing ability, stamina, top throwing speed, and the distance a hit pitch will travel.

There is also the option to watch a computer-controlled match.</desc>
	<path>./Tetris (Japan).smd</path>
	<desc>Tetris is one of many conversions of the famous block-stacking game, this one is based on the 1988 coin-op version produced by Sega. The goal is to place pieces made up of four tiles in a ten-by-twenty well, organizing them into complete rows, which then disappear. As rows are cleared, the pace of the game increases and the background changes, and the game ends if the stack reaches the top of the well.

In addition to a standard endless mode for one or two players, the game also includes a "time trial" mode for one or two players, where the goal is to get as many points as possible in three minutes. There is also a "doubles" mode, where two players work together to fill lines in an extra-wide well, each controlling their own pieces simultaneously.

The game offers a number of standard options: setting the starting level, how much "garbage" is at the bottom of the well when the game starts, and whether the next piece is visible. There are also optional "item blocks," which are special flashing pieces that give an extra bonus if they are used to clear a line.</desc>

	<path>./Time Dominator 1st (Japan).smd</path>
	<desc>A fast-paced platform game in the vein of the classic Sonic the Hedgehog. The evil overlord Time Dominator has constructed a time machine and is using it to steal treasures from the past, creating a warp in the flow of time. The Time Warp Patrol, created to prevent this sort of thing from happening, sends the special time-traveling duck Socket (or Minutes in the Japanese version) to fix the flow of time and stop Time Dominator.

Socket has reasonably basic abilities: he can jump, kick to the side or straight upward, and run quite fast. As Socket is a robot, his energy level continually drains from simply being in operation; thankfully, there are a liberal amount of electric bolts strewn about each stage, which will refill his health when picked up. Getting hit by enemies will take a chunk out of his life bar.

There are seven different themed zones, each with four separate parts. First up is the High Speed Zone, which is a gateway level leading to the next zone, and as the name suggests it encourages high speed play. Next is the Athletic Zone, which generally entails lots of jumping, and the Labyrinth Zone, which is focused on exploration and simply finding a path to the exit. At the end of each Labyrinth Zone, Socket faces off against Time Dominator in a boss round, then moves on to the next High Speed Zone.

The game also features a sound test mode and a time trial mode, where the High Speed Zone stages can be played without any enemies present with times being recorded.</desc>

The game lets the player choose whether to play on a US or Japanese golf course. Once out on the course, the player must choose which golf club to use, where to make contact with the ball, and where to aim in the direction they want the ball to go. Once that's decided the player fills a swing meter and hits the ball trying to get the ball into the hole.</desc>

	<desc>An overhead scrolling fantasy shoot 'em up, Twinkle Tale casts the player in the role of the young witch Saria, in a quest to rid her magical floating island of the evil creatures that have invaded it.

The game is played from an overhead perspective, with Saria having complete freedom of movement in all directions and with the objective being to clear out all enemies in all 9 stages, looting whatever treasure you can find and defeating each stage's boss.

Uchu Senkan Gomorrah (Space Battle Ship Gomorrah) is a horizontally-scrolling shooter based on the 1990 coin-op of the same title. The player controls the titular ship, Gomorrah, which can shoot both straight forward as in most shooting games, as well as freely in any direction via an aiming cursor, which is controlled independently of the ship itself. Additionally, there are several power-ups that can be found, including speed-ups, additional mounted guns, and the life-up, which will not only increase the ship's armor, but also cause it to grow in size as well.

The game features 9 stages, each with a boss at the end, as well as one or two-player simultaneous play. The game difficulty has been rebalanced from the arcade to compensate for the lack of a trackball to control the aiming cursor; the player must stop their ship in order to move the cursor.

Standing hundreds of feet tall with incredible strength and amazing abilities, he can only remain on Earth for a few minutes, and so must defeat his foes before his power drains completely.

Based on the popular television show from 1967, Ultraman directly follows the story of its source material. Cast in the role of the titular Ultraman, the player must defeat many of the same monsters that appeared in the original series. Taking the appearance of a 1-on-1 fighting game, Ultraman can punch, kick, and grapple his opponent, as well as use a variety of various special moves that must be charged. However, in order to actually defeat his opponent, Ultraman must deplete their continually-recharging life bar, and at that moment hit with his most powerful special attack: the Specium Beam. As the game continues, different enemies may even find ways to avoid this most formidable attack, and Ultraman must adapt... Each stage has a time limit of only three minutes, and there are three lives and no continues.</desc>

Verytex is a vertically scrolling space shooter with vague organic themes. There are six stages and three different weapon types: Normal Shot, a standard multidirectional cannon; Beam Laser, a powerful forward-shooting weapon; and Boomerang Laser, a wide-range forward shot. Each weapon type can be upgraded to three increasing levels of power. Also available are homing missiles, which are also upgradeable, as well as smart bombs and shield pickups.</desc>
	<path>./V-Five (Japan).smd</path>
	<desc>This cartridge combines two different localized flavours of the original arcade game. There are two modes, Grind Stormer and V Five. Both offers the same levels and enemies, but have a different approach to how the player can use power-ups.

In this hectic, top-down, vertically-scrolling shooter where the screen is constantly filled with enemies and bullets, players have a constant, unlimited firing rate, enhanced by power-ups that include missiles, target-seeking bullets, shields, additional speed, extra power and bonus points. In Grind Stormer the ship always moves at a fast speed and the player can collect bombs that damage the entire screen and fend off bullets. The other variant V Five takes a Gradius-approach to power-ups, having the player advance through a selection of power-ups shown on the right by collecting tokens. In the first mode power-ups are immediately applied. In the second mode the ship is much slower and the player needs to decide to spend tokens on speed power-ups right away or save them to advance to seeking bullets or additional power.

There are five worlds, each with several screens and large boss at the end, as well as a minigame between worlds where bonus items can be earned. The game can be played alone or two-player cooperatively.</desc>

	<desc>Wonder Boy III: Monster Lair is a quite different game to most of the games in the Wonder Boy series. You play a green-haired dude who must attack the invaders that attempt to collect weapons and use them to destroy the land. The game starts out like a simple platform game, but it's just when Wonder Boy enters the skull further on that the game is transformed into a shoot 'em up, so basically the gameplay consists of action and shooter scenes.

In the action scenes, your vitality decreases as you make your way towards the skull, but this can be restored by collecting fruit. A wide variety of weapons can be picked up, and not only does these allow you to use the weapons for a limited amount of time, but they also increase your vitality. 

In the shooter scenes, you ride your pink friend as you make your way through the scene. Here, your vitality remains static unless you are hit by an enemy passing by. As usual, there is a boss waiting for you at the end which you must defeat. Every boss changes color to show how much damage has been done to it. You have to defeat some bosses in two stages.

If your vitality gets low in each scene, you'll lose a life. You can also choose to have Wonder Girl join you, as two players can play the game.

	<desc>Based on the manga/animé series Yu Yu Hakusho. This is a story of a teenager delinquent Yuusuke Urameshi, who was hit by a car while trying to save a child. However, there was no place found for him either in paradise or in hell, and Koenma, the son of the death god Enma, sends him back to our world, where he has to be an "occult detective" and to fight against demons. Several characters join him on his quest: Kazuma Kuwabara, his ex-rival and best friend; Kurama, a 1400-year-old demon fox; and Hiei, formerly a demon who tried to conquer the world and had to repent for his sins by helping Yuusuke.

You must play the individual chapters of the four playable characters (Yuusuke, Kuwabara, Kurama, and Hiei), until in the final chapter you control them all in the ultimate confrontation against evil forces. The game is a Japanese-style adventure (no puzzles, menu-driven interface) with the addition of battles. The battles are real time; similarly to fighting games, you can kick, punch, defend, and use special techniques. Unlike most Japanese adventures, you view the game world from platform-like third person perspective (although you cannot move physically in adventure mode).

	<path>./Zan Yasha Enbuden (Japan).smd</path>
	<desc>Zan: Yasha Enbukyoku is a turn-based strategy game set in feudal Japan.

The background for the game's events is the ongoing battle between noble warriors, known as yasha, and demons. Between the two stand the "middle people", i.e. other Japanese generals and rulers. The player can choose to play as either yasha, demonic, or "middle" army. 

The player has to manage his army, deploying units for protection and attack, as well as negotiating with other rulers. Events such as earthquakes, plagues, etc. occur randomly. Diplomacy doesn't always work, so battles against enemy armies occupy a large portion of the game. The battles are somewhat similar to those of turn-based RPGs (though the game has no RPG elements): the player chooses commands from a menu, such as attack, use magic, use special technique, use a battle formation, etc. There is no active movement during the battles. The outcome of the battle depends on the chosen commands as well as on the strength of the units.</desc>
	<path>./Zero Wing (Japan).smd</path>
	<desc>Zero Wing is an horizontal shooter game where the player is in control of a ZIG, an escape pod released after its main ship was attacked and destroyed by the evil cyborg CATS, bent on taking over the world.

Like most games in the genre, there are three color-coded weapons: red (scatter), green (homing) and blue (lasers). Each weapon has three levels of power, and to obtain those, similar upgrades must be collected sequentially. However, what makes the game unique is the ability to use a traction beam to trap an enemy and then throw him against his peers, destroying them.

The game (or the European PAL version) is best known for being the origin of the infamous "All Your Base" 2001 Internet meme.</desc>

	<desc>16t is a scrolling platform action game similar to Teddy Boy, in which the player controls a youngster in prison garb named Apple Gaikichi, who must eliminate all the enemies on each stage. Apple's only method of attack is throwing enormous 16 ton weights (thus the title), which can and will crush enemies in a bloody mess. However, these weights will bounce off each other, so the player must be careful to not let Apple get crushed himself. They are also not entirely unlimited, as the player can only hold five at once, and they must be allowed to recharge when Apple runs out. Enemies on each stage will appear from the top of the screen in waves, through a randomly cycling "slots" meter, and once all slots and enemies have been cleared, the player moves on to the next stage.</desc>

At your disposal is a vulcan cannon (basically a machine gun) and a limited number of missiles. In some versions of the game the guns fire automatically all the time. Sometimes you come across a friendly supply plane and if you dock with it you can replenish your missiles.

The game is viewed from behind the plane with you fighting wave after wave of enemy fighters. But at heart it offers the usual shooter mechanics, meaning you spend most of your time dodging and shooting. You also can speed up and slow down to deal with enemies which appear behind you.</desc>

	<desc>The game from Virgin based on the 1992 animated Disney film is a side-scrolling platformer.

The player controls Aladdin, who must make his way through several levels based on locations from the movie: from the streets and rooftops of Agrabah, the Cave of Wonders and the Sultan's dungeon to the final confrontation in Grand Vizier Jafar's palace. The Sultan's guards and also animals of the desert want to hinder Aladdin in his way. He can defend himself with his sword or by throwing apples. Next to apples, Aladdin can also collect gems which can be traded for lives and continues with a traveling trader. Finding Genie or Abu icons enables bonus rounds. The Genie bonus round is a game of luck played for apples, gems or extra lives.

	<path>./Alisia Dragoon (Japan).bin</path>
	<desc>Alisia Dragoon is the female protagonist of this fast-paced platform game. Alisia must destroy an evil demon and avenge her fathers death through eight stages. She has only one weapon to dispose of enemies: thunder magic. This magic is auto-aiming and can track multiple targets. However, the game is quite hard as the levels are loaded with fantasy-inspired monsters. Using thunder magic reduces a magic gauge, meaning you often have to wait for it to recharge. Once fully charged Alisia can unleash a massive rolling blast of lightning across the screen.

During the game, you can improve your magic by picking up potions. There are also four monsters which accompany Alisia: Dragon Frye, Ball O'Fire, Thunder Raven and Boomerang Lizard. Each has different abilities, deciding which, if any, to use in a given situation is part of the challenge. These monsters, like Alisia herself, are fully upgradeable with power-ups. They can also die if weakened too much, forcing you to hunt for a reviving power-up. You can pause the game and select your companion at any time.</desc>

"Devilish" is different from other paddle games by letting you play with two paddles. The lower one behaves just like a usual paddle - you use it to prevent the ball from dropping down. The upper one can move and turn, allowing you to hit the ball from different angles and from different parts of the screen. You advance through levels by destroying bricks and enemies, going up until the level boss enemy appears.</desc>

	<path>./Bare Knuckle - Ikari no Tetsuken - Streets of Rage (World) (Rev A).bin</path>
	<desc>Streets of Rage, Sega's answer to Final Fight, follows the story of three young police officers (Adam Hunter, Axel Stone and Blaze Fielding) in a city controlled by a criminal syndicate led by a "Mr. X" where crime is rampant, which leads the three heroes to make a pact to leave the force and topple the syndicate by themselves.

Gameplay is straightforward and simple. Three buttons are used, one to jump, other to attack and another to perform a range attack from a support police car. Each character has a limited set of moves that include punching and kicking or performing a back attack (if in the open), two grapple moves (depending if holding the opponent in front or by the back), a flying attack, and if playing with another player two additional tag attacks, and different abilities: Adam is slow, but a good jumper and a hard hitter, Axel fast and also a hard hitter, but a lousy jumper and Blaze fast and a good jumper, but weak hitter.
Levels are in typical arcade side-scroller fashion: move from left to right (with two exceptions), clearing screens from enemies one after another as fast as possible while avoid taking damage with a boss in the end. Some levels feature "death drops" where the player must avoid falling, while throwing enemies there at the same time, including a typical elevator level. Several items are scattered on the ground, from melee weapons and bonus points (and lives or additional police cars) to apples and turkeys (to restore health).</desc>
	<path>./Bare Knuckle II (Japan).bin</path>
	<desc>After Axel Stone, Blaze Fielding and Adam Hunter destroyed the evil Syndicate leader, Mr. X, the city became a peaceful place to live, and each one of them followed their own paths. One year later, after their reunion, Adam's brother Sammy returned from school to find their apartment in a mess, and Adam nowhere to be seen, and after calling his two friends, one of them notices a photo of Adam chained to a wall, next to someone they knew very well - Mr. X, who returned to turn the peaceful city once again into a war zone. Now, Axel, Blaze, Sammy, and Axel's good friend Max, a pro wrestler, must head out to stop Mr. X once again...hopefully for good...

Streets of Rage 2 differs from the previous title in several ways. There are changes in both graphics (characters now are bigger, more detailed and with more animation frames, and scenarios are less grainy) and gameplay (the rocket move was replaced by a special move that doubles in offense and defense along several new moves), along other new features such as life bars (and names) for all enemies and the radically different new characters.</desc>
	<path>./Bare Knuckle III (Japan).bin</path>
	<desc>In part three of the Streets of Rage series, Mr. X is back and this time his plan involves replacing public officials with his own robots. Only Axel, Blaze, Skate, and new-comer Dr. Zan can stop him. Streets of Rage 3 features all of the beat 'em up action you would expect from a Streets of Rage game. One new feature is the special move power bar, where it only costs energy to do a special move if the bar isn't full. Also new is the ability to do special maneuvers with different weapons, depending on the character. For example, Skate has no special move with the pipe, but does have one with the knife. The opposite is true for Axel. Any weapon Dr. Zan picks up is turned into energy balls which he can throw at the enemies. Secret characters and multiple endings add replay value.</desc>
	<path>./Batman (Japan).bin</path>
	<desc>The Genesis version of Batman: The Video Game follows closely the plot from the 1989 movie.

The game consists in six stages, four of side-scrolling platform action and two side-scrolling shooter ones, in the following order: Gotham City Street, Axis Chemical Factory, Flugelheim Museum, Gotham City Street (with the Batmobile and after that on foot), In the Sky over Gotham City (with the Batwing) and the Cathedral, where Batman finally faces the Joker.

Batman can beat his enemies by punching them, slide kicking (by pressing down and the B button) or throwing his Batarang. By holding down the B button, Batman will block projectile-based attacks. He can also use his double jump (pressing the C button a second time while ascending) to leap greater distances or attack his enemies. To reach higher platforms, Batman can use his Grappling Hook (by pressing up and C to shoot, C again to climb). While piloting the Batmobile or the Batwing, Batman can shoot the Twin Vulcan Cannons (B button) or Twin Homing Missiles (A button).

Through the levels, Batman will collect Batman emblems (which will give him Batarangs or Twin Homing Missiles, depending on the stage played), Hearts (which give him health) and Batman heads (which give him an extra life).

	<desc>Gil Hazard, president of the Hazard Foundation, is secretly Professor G, the leader of the evil Dark Hazard organization. He has designs on world domination, and has plans to use the power of golf toward this end; this is the Battle Golfer project. Yui Mizuhara and Ran Ryuzaki are two ordinary high school girls who just so happen to be golf prodigies, and so are prime candidates for the Battle Golfer project. They are abducted by Professor G, but are rescued by a mysterious man before they can be taken under his control. Having escaped, Yui hears about a golf tournament being held by the Hazard Foundation, and suspecting more nefarious plans, she secretly enters the tournament to stop him for good.

Battle Golfer Yui is a unique genre fusion between a golf game and a Japanese-style adventure game. The main adventure mode casts the player as Yui competing in the Hazard Cup tournament. The player can interact with other characters on the course, and will need to defeat several different opponents at match play on oddly-themed courses in order to proceed. The system is quite simple and fast-paced; simply choose a direction, a club, spin, and hit the bar with the right timing to adjust shot power. Each character also has special abilities to help them out, but these are limited in use. There is also a regular golf mode for one or two players, offered as both stroke and match play.</desc>

All beasts or dragons have two basic attacks: a punch and a tail attack, as well as a special attack that can only be performed while a certain icon is displayed. During close combat, pressing the A or C button rapidly will result in a throwing or choking attack. There is no visible health bar, but three icons are displayed at the bottom of the screen. Once a dragon is knocked down for a longer moment, one icon turns red. Once all icons are red, the fight is lost. The battle arena is surrounded by an electric fence, that opponents can be thrown into and which can also be used to initiate jump attacks.

There are two modes of play: Match and Tournament. Match is a single match for one or two players, where several different dragons are available. Tournament sees the player starting out with a week dragon who has to fight increasingly difficult battles and increase his stats (Power, Speed and Stamina). After every other battle, a shop can be visited that offers different items including food that increases Power, Speed or Stamina, Data Disks that contain information on other Dragons and more. After visiting the shop, Dragons can be trained. The training consists of simply selecting an attribute to be increased. At a few points in the game, it is possible to splice the player's Dragon's genes which that of a defeated Opponent to gain different abilities.</desc>

Each mode can be played against either the computer or a friend, and there are three different lane types available. There is also a practice mode for each of the game types.

The Japanese version, Boogie Woogie Bowling, is largely the same but features different, more anime-style characters to play as (including a robot for no explained reason), as well as minor tweaks to the timing for throws.</desc>

When he survived the deadly accident, he was possessed with abnormal powers. Having realized this, he decided to act in the cause of justice. He is determined to escape the Eastern Bloc country he called home and run and jump across the world to finish in the US.

What distinguishes Chelnov from other platform games is its use of forced scrolling. This occurs when the screen moves continuously from left to right, forcing players to negotiate the game's many obstacles and enemies without controlling Chelnov's speed of progress. Enemies attack from left, right, above, and below, and Chelnov can switch the direction he's facing to attack enemies that are behind him. Some enemies in the game carry different types of weapons and power-ups, and when they are shot at, the power-ups drop to the ground and can be picked up.</desc>

	<desc>Five-year-old Shinnosuke Nohara is the epitome of noisy children: loud and inappropriate, infuriating to his parents, and hilarious to onlookers. Shin-chan is always getting in trouble with his parents and saying bizarre or offensive things to everyone he meets.

Arashi o Yobu Enji ("A Kindergartner Called Tempest") is one of many games based on the manga and anime created by Yoshito Usui. In four stages, each made up of five areas, Shin-chan must explore his neighborhood looking for a specific object. He can enter houses to ask people for information, but will often end up simply insulting them. He must also avoid or knock over the other children in the neighborhood, and has various ability cards that he can use to assist him, which might give him a water pistol or refill his health. After finding what he's looking for, Shin-chan will move on to the next area.

Also included is a minigame mode with eight different minigames, such as a bubble-blowing contest, a three-legged race, and a desperate search for clothing before school. The entire game, including the minigames, is filled with dialogue containing the same humor as the source material.

With the first step of his dream complete, Franco sails out with his father's good friend as first mate, you're off to find fame, adventure and fortunes out on the sea and in uncharted waters.

Uncharted Waters is a sailing and trading simulation. Your goal is initially to sail between ports and trade goods between them to make a profit. Along the way, you may be called upon by merchants and royalty to do specific tasks. Several different nations as well as pirates roam the sea and not all have good relations with one another. You can take as long as you want and explore as much of the world as possible to complete your ultimate task of marrying Christiana, which will require your fame rating to be quite high anyway. Available at most ports is a trader for cargo, a supply station for your crew's food and water as well as repairs, a shipbuilder, an item store and finally a pub for gaining information, crew and gambling.

All of the game progresses on an overhead-view, by sea you navigate your fleet by direction and can issue additional orders including landing on any piece of land to search for supplies. A variety of hazards live at sea including storms, other ships, seaweed and simply bad winds and currents.</desc>
	<path>./Daikoukai Jidai II (Japan).bin</path>
	<desc>In the first Uncharted Waters game, it was the 15th century and the New World was discovered. Now in New Horizons, it is the early 16th century and the age of exploration and sea trade is underway. Players choose from any one of six adventurers (scenarios), each with their own distinctive but intertwining plot, to embark on a quest of sailing, seamanship and exploration. The six characters are:

1. Joao Franco is the son of Duke Leon Franco, the hero of the first Uncharted Waters game and an influential man in Portugal. His father wants to make him into a strong man and so decides to send him out to sea. Young Joao is tasked with learning the skills of the sailor (he is the only character who starts at level one) and embarking on a quest of discovery; reaching the far east and eventually looking for the secret of Atlantis.

2. Catalina Erantzo is a Spanish naval officer who believes her beloved and her brother were both murdered by the Portuguese armada. Vowing revenge she turns to a life of piracy and soon becomes a red haired scourge of the seas.

3. Pietro Conti is a indebted man, having inherited the financial woes of the Conti family. When the Duchess Franco hires him to spy on her son, he accepts the job and obtains a ship. Pietro hopes to use these resources to seek out valuable treasure and clear up his family's debt.

4. Ernst Von Bohr is a geographer who is teaching classes in Holland. But he yearns to leave the classroom and sail the high seas, living a life of adventure that he has only read about in books. When his friend, Mercator offers to finance his initial voyage in exchange for cartography information about the world, Ernst is given the opportunity to live out his dream.

5. Ali Vezas is a poor orphaned child living in Istanbul and serving others. He dreams of becoming his own master and making his own fortune across foreign lands. A twist of fate aides in providing him with small loans, with which he is able to afford his first ship and sail out with a cargo hold full of goods...

6. Otto Baynes styles himself a Royal Knight of the British Empire, in the service of his majesty the king. Promoted to Admiral of the British fleet, the kingdom is worried about the increased naval power of Spanish fleets. Otto is given a letter of marque by the king and ordered to terrorize the Spanish Fleet. Equipping himself simply at first, Otto strives to become a great Privateer in the name of King and Country.

Regardless of the character chosen, Uncharted Waters: New Horizons is a top-down sailing simulation. At sea, players control the direction of their ship, where speed is affected by the number/health of the crew, the wind and the currents. Players can navigate anywhere there is water (though some ships are not ocean worthy) and discover interesting landmarks and new ports. Upon landing at a port, the view is also top-down and the player can enter different buildings, each with unique services and goods. These include: The Inn, the Item Shop, The Shipyard, The Tavern, The Castle, The Guild Hall, The Church, The Merchant and the Harbor. It's up to the player to earn enough gold to keep the crew fed and financed and keep the fleet repaired. Primary methods of earning money are through sea trade, accepting jobs from the guild, gambling and battle with other ships.

During naval combat, the game becomes a turn-based top-down strategy game, with the player moving ships in order to obtain trajectories needed to fire cannons at enemy ships, or run alongside enemy vessels in order to board them. If the player's flagship attacks the flagship of the enemy fleet, they can challenge the opponent to a duel. If accepted, the game changes to a side-view of the two captains engaged in a fight. During this sequence, the player can only choose which fighting maneuver (strike, thrust, parry, lash) they wish to engage in.

The Dragons must now embark on a mission to avenge her death and defeat the Black Warriors for the second and final time.

The original arcade version of "Double Dragon II" was essentially an improved version of the first game. In addition to offering renewed audio and visuals, as well as new traps, moves and enemy characters, "Double Dragon II" discarded the conventional punch and kick buttons in favor of a direction-oriented attacking system similar to the original Technos beat-em-up Renegade.

The NES version offered new stages, new moves and illustrated cut-scenes, as well as a new final boss and a new ending. Unlike the first NES game, it offered 2-Player Co-Op gameplay with the option to turn off the friendly fire.

The Game Boy version of "Double Dragon II" is an English localization of a "Kunio-kun" game (the Japanese franchise which inspired "Renegade" and "River City Ransom" and has nothing to do with the arcade and NES versions.

	<path>./Dragon Ball Z - Buyuu Retsuden (Japan).bin</path>
	<desc>Dragon Ball Z: L'Appel Du Destin is a fighting game that maintains the dual screen mode previously seen in the DBZ Super Butouden series of the SNES, which allowed you to be far from the opponent yet still be able to see him by having the screen split between the two characters. This is important to note, as the most damaging attack of the game could be just executed from far away of your opponent, the energy fireball projectiles. These special attacks also need that you have your KI bar (which unlike energy one, is rechargeable) to a considerable level and the only way to block them is by means of a long button combination.

The constitution of the characters is based strictly on the Freezer and Cell sagas (Son Goku SSJ, Son Gohan SSJ2, Piccolo, Vegeta SSJ, Future Trunks SSJ, Krilin, Recoome, Ginyu, Freezer, A-18 and Perfect Cell), with special mention to Krilin, Ginyu and Recoome, who made here their first appearance in a fighting game. There are also 9 scenarios available, all of them corresponding to recognizable areas of the anime itself, some also appearing for 2 times but in different status (ie, "normal" Namek and Namek "in flames").

Indeed, you can do pretty much everything a typical dolphin does, including eating fish, surfacing in order to breathe, using your biological sonar and of course, jumping out of the water to amaze your friends.

The storyline is actually deeper that one may think by looking at the box illustration. As Ecco, you are the only dolphin who managed to escape from a giant whirlpool which sucked down your entire pod. The five shining stars on your forehead show that you are the chosen one to save them. But that task will be not be an easy one, as you will have to travel through time and space with the Atlantean time machine, and meet the mystical Asterite in order to defeat the Vortex Queen.</desc>

The player needs to collect five upgrades in order to improve their weaponry, but the upgrade affects all three weapons.

The game includes eight stages, most of which include both a midboss and a boss at the end, and three difficulty settings. There is also a minigame similar to Whack-a-Mole where there is a grid of ship icons, and the player must hit the rotating ships.</desc>

	<desc>Ranger X was released fairly late in the lifetime of the megadrive. Coming from an unknown developer it was released with little fanfare and advertising but has become one of the best demonstrations of what the genesis/megadrive is capable of.

The game is a side scrolling shooter of sorts. You control a large mech (robot) which has a smaller side-kick mech which is a bit like a car. The two can join together providing an alternate shooting mode. Whilst controlling just the main mech however, the player can shoot both forward and back by using different buttons. The mech can also use it's rocket pack to boost off of the ground and hover for a short while. Levels are not necessarily left to right moving (although for the most part they are) and the game is an interesting blend of platform game and shoot-em-up.

The game features innovative graphics given the hardware limitations - there is a 3D introduction to most levels (remembering that the console had no 3D capability and a tile-based renderer) and some levels use a line-based scrolling effect to give the impression of 3D backgrounds.</desc>

The World Championship mode has of course returned, though the managerial Constructors mode is no longer present. There is also a Free Attack mode, where any course can be freely practiced; a Training mode, where special training courses can be raced on to learn the ins and outs of the game; and a Watch mode, where the player can choose a course and watch a demonstration race.

There is also a battle mode where one or two players can race each other or against computer opponents, as well as a test run mode where the player can learn each course and try to set course records. There are a total of 16 different courses, which can be played in either dry, wet, or half-wet conditions, as well as a wide variety of vehicle settings that can be tweaked.</desc>

	<path>./Final Blow (Japan).bin</path>
	<desc>Final Blow is an action game based around the sport of boxing. You can play the fighters in a sequence of knock-out competitions, (the computer versions also include a round-robin league). Rounds last one minute, with a short break in between them. As in the real sport, your aim is to knock your opponent down for 10 seconds, by gradually weakening him with a series of punches. You can block punches, to avoid them inflicting damage onto you. The ring is of a limited size, so players can be cornered, although the referee will intervene to break the boxers up if they become entangled in a stalemate position.

The genesis version is not to be confused with the Master System game of the same name, which is entirely different.</desc>

	<desc>Fire Mustang is a fast side-scrolling shooter set during World War II. The player controls a P-51D Mustang plane through different missions, with many enemies on the screen at the same time and a large aircraft as a boss at the end of every mission. The Mustang has an unlimited amount of bullets, but one hit is sufficient to lose a life. There are different power-ups to collect, providing additional fire power and new firing patterns. Regardless of the power-ups, the Mustang shoots forward and drops bombs to the ground at the same time, targeting ground troops. There is a limited amount of forgers, large blasts damaging many enemies at once.</desc>

	<desc>Thunder Pro Wrestling Retsuden is a spinoff of Human's popular Fire Pro Wrestling series, and the only title in the series to appear on the Mega Drive. Like the other Fire Pro games, it is an arcade-style wrestling game featuring a roster of fictional wrestlers. The game includes a standard World Championship mode where the player picks a wrestler and fights his way to win the title. There is also an "Exciting" mode in which one or two players can play an exhibition singles or tag match against the computer or each other, an Elimination mode where each player picks a team of five wrestlers, and a "Handicap" mode where one fighter must alone take on a tag team.

	<path>./Flintstone (Japan).bin</path>
	<desc>This is a platform game based on the famous Flintstones series. The game features many original Flintstones characters, such as Fred, Wilma, Barney, and others. Instead of the usual "save the princess" or "liberate the world" kinds of a plot, "The Flintstones" is mainly based on small quests: Fred has to retrieve a lost item, etc. The large levels are divided into smaller stages. In the end of each level there is a boss battle. The gameplay involves mostly jumping and hitting the enemies on the heads with a club. The health is measured by hearts. During the game Fred will find many useful items, including some that will increase his health level.</desc>
	<path>./Fushigi no Umi no Nadia (Japan).bin</path>
	<desc>This is one of the several games based on the animé series The Secret of Blue Water. The series (and the game) are loosely based on the stories by the famous French science fiction author Jules Verne. The game is set in 1889, a time of great inventions and technology progress unseen before. You play as Jean, a young genius scientist. In Paris he meets Nadia, an African circus performer. Nadia wears a pendant that contains magical powers, and that is why the evil Gargoyle is after her - this pendant is just the item she needs to build the ultimate weapon, the Tower of Babel. Jean will do anything to protect Nadia, and hope that his love to her, his adventurer spirit, and the power of science will eventually defeat Gargoyle!

Unlike most Japanese adventures, "Fushigi no Umi no Nadia" is a top-down, third-person perspective game, in which you actually move your character around. Nadia and other friends join Jean in a RPG-like fashion (although there is no combat in the game, different characters have their own item-based abilities you should use at certain points). There are no real puzzles in the game, but you'll often have to use your inventory items to make the game progress.

Not to confuse with other Fushigi no Umi no Nadia games (for NES, Turbo CD, etc.)!</desc>

Along the way Lucia will have to shoot down dozens of enemies in standard shooter fashion, while avoiding destruction and collecting power-ups that extend her ship's energy, upgrade weapons and gather screen-clearing bombs.

The Gleylancer comes equipped with two hovering satellites that can receive weapon upgrades of their own, and can lock their positions at specific angles to increase your firepower and protect the player from enemy attacks. Features only a single-player campaign with two different endings depending on how the final stages are completed (e.g. if Lucia's father is rescued or not).

	<desc>This 'Prince of Darkness' has taken away the Golden Axe and put an evil curse over all the warriors. However, one of the heroes has their curse relieved and is sent to set things straight - lift curse off others, defeat the villian and return with the Golden Axe.

The gameplay has been expanded slightly, but is essentially the same hack n' slash as the previous games. New features to the series include new characters, new moves and junction points where you can choose which path to take.</desc>

	<path>./Heavy Unit - Mega Drive Special (Japan).bin</path>
	<desc>In an era of frequent alien attacks, the Earth has a unified Government, which relies on a line of cyborgs known as the Heavy Dolls for defense. The greatest of these are known as the Heavy Nova, a title earned by passing a rigorous training regime.

You are taking on the simulated proving grounds, which are split into two styles of alternating action. In the first you must progress (initially purely horizontally, though later with vertical flick-scrolling as well) through a hostile environment of enemies, bombs and traps, gaining points for doing it quickly and with lots of energy left. Initially you can fly and kick as needed.

Once this section is complete, you move on to one-on-one combat of the Street Fighter 2 style. The early foes have far less energy than you begin with. As you progress through the game, you are awarded extra attacking moves, in a manner similar to Brutal: Paws of Fury</desc>

	<path>./Honoo no Toukyuuji Dodge Danpei (Japan).bin</path>
	<desc>Danpei Ichigeki is a young boy who loves dodgeball. Danpei's father was a famous dodgeball player when he was still alive, and he joins the Dodgeball Club at his elementary school. However, these kids are very serious about their dodgeball, and the road ahead isn't going to be easy for Danpei.

Dodge Danpei is a team dodgeball game, one of several based on the anime and manga created by Tetsuhiro Koshita, which plays strikingly similar to the well-known Super Dodge Ball. Each team has four main players and three support players, and attempts to knock out the opposing team's main members by throwing the ball at them in various ways. Apart from normal throws, the player can also pass to teammates, and execute special power throws which are harder to dodge or catch.

The game includes several different game modes, including the main story mode which follows the story of the anime, as well as one- and two-player exhibition matches. There is also a "league" mode which allows for a tournament of up to six teams, as well as a training mode where the game teaches the basics of how to play the game.</desc>
	<path>./Hybrid Front, The (Japan).bin</path>
	<desc>The Hybrid Front is a turn-based strategy video game, released in Japan (exclusively) for the Mega Drive.

The introduction begins with someone logging into a computer. Then, it shows a revolution that occurred sometime in the 2080s leading into a series of wars and conflict that lead up to the video game's main setting of the 26th century. Since the second half of the 21st century, the depletion of fossil fuel resources have helped to deepen the conflict on Earth...
During the 24th century, the Earth was bombarded from orbit with massive optical weapons called the Metal Hammer by an Italian consortium; major cities around the world were burned to toast. The resistance would eventually be put down by CoCoON (abbreviation for COoperation COmmunity of Orbital Negotiation). Not only they would gain the corporate hegemony of humanity, CoCoON would develop a reputation as a hostile group of corporate war hawks; constantly revolting against the peaceful coalition of the PETO (abbreviation for Pan Earth Treaty Organization).

	<path>./Hyokkori Hyoutanjima (Japan).bin</path>
	<desc>Hyokkori Hyotanjima: Daitoryo o Mezase! ("Aim for the Presidency!") is a sugoroku-style board game for up to four players based on the popular NHK children's show Hyokkori Hyotanjima. Four characters from the show all decide they want to be the island's president, and so they set off to start campaigning.

The goal of each round is to collect the most points; points can be earned or lost based on the spaces the player lands on. The round ends when a player reaches the destination set at the start of the round, which gives a points bonus. The player with the most points after a set number of rounds is the winner.

	<path>./Hyper Marbles (SN) (Japan).bin</path>
	<desc>In the future, even the simple kids game of marbles is high-tech and extreme. Hyper Marbles takes the basic concept of the classic kids game -- to knock the opponent's marbles out of the playfield -- and gives it a futuristic sci-fi twist. The player directs their robotic marble around the field, attempting to push their opponents into the deadly electrified walls lining the arena. Aiding in this is a jet booster, which can cause opponents to bounce quite far, but if overused will overheat and must cool down before being used again. There are ten different arenas, each with different hazards like oil slicks and moving barriers. There is a single player mode, where the goal is to destroy all enemies to move on, as well as a two-player versus mode where the goal is to destroy the other player.</desc>
	<path>./I Love Mickey &amp; Donald - Fushigi na Magic Box (Japan).bin</path>
	<desc>World of Illusion is sort of a follow-up to Castle of Illusion. Mickey Mouse and Donald Duck are taken to a magic world and have to get back home. In order to do that, they can play magical tricks and interact to each other in a 2-player mode. Like other Disney games for SEGA consoles of the same period, the game has cartoon-like graphics and is played as a side-scrolling platformer.</desc>
	<path>./I Love Mickey Mouse - Fushigi no Oshiro Dai Bouken (Japan).bin</path>
	<desc>This is the first Mickey Mouse game for Sega consoles. In this game the famous Disney character must face the dangers of weird fantasy lands such as an enchanted forest and a toy world. Mickey must rescue his girlfriend Minnie who's been kidnapped by the evil witch Mizrabel.

The game play follows the traditional 2D hop 'n' bop platform style in both 8-bit and 16-bit versions. Apart from the story and the music, which is the same, all the rest (including controls, moves, stages and, obviously, graphics), are totally different.</desc>
	<path>./Ichidant R (Japan).bin</path>
	<desc>Ichidant-R is the second game in the Puzzle &amp; Action series, and the sequel to Tant-R. Twenty new minigames are present, including rocketship assembly, a batting contest, and hitting the brakes on a speeding car.

The game once again includes an arcade mode for one or two players. This time, the player is questing to rescue a kidnapped princess from an evil knight. There is also a quest mode which plays like a simple RPG, where battles are fought via minigames. Of course, the four-player competition and free modes also make a return, rounding out the package.</desc>
	<path>./J. League Champion Soccer (Japan).bin</path>
	<desc>European Club Soccer has dozens of teams from all across Europe (around 170), and each country is represented by at least two teams. In addition to correct club names, it also has recognizable imitations of team badges and kits; although more elaborate kits (such as those worn by Juventus, FC Porto or Celtic F.C.) are simplified (Juventus have a silver shirt, Porto blue and Celtic green). Player names, on the other hand, were made by mixing names found on real squads. Portuguese teams, for instance, had a large number of Yugoslavian players in the early 1990s, and that was reflected by players with names such as Valentim Ivic (of Valentim Loureiro and Tomislav Ivic, then Boavista FC chairman and S.L. Benfica manager, respectively). Names could not be changed, and since the game lacked a battery, it does not store changes done to kits and passwords were used to resume tournaments (example of a password sheet). Rotherham United are included amongst the English clubs despite never playing in the top tier of English football, this is due to the developer, Krisalis Software, being based in Rotherham. All other clubs have played in their own country's top tier.</desc>

The game is viewed from a birds-eye perspective with a full field minimap on the side of the screen. The player can also make substitutions and choose from six different formations. It features an official J.Leauge license, including all ten teams and all players from the 1993 season.

	<desc>Pro Striker 2 is the sequel to the first title, and is a very similar soccer game to the previous year's model. The updates are largely cosmetic, with the game retaining the same top-down view and field minimap. Of course, the full 1994 J.League team and player roster is included. The exhibition, playoff, and league modes are back from the first game, as well as the all-star mode that was added in its update. Once again, up to four players can play simultaneously, and the menu system has also been greatly streamlined.

	<desc>A daughter of the chair of a local high school, Yu Honjo, has been kidnapped by someone unknown. Unable to go to the police, the girl's sister, Mai, hires a private investigator to find out what happened to her. The only piece of evidence is a photograph from the night of Yu's disappearance, where the missing girl and three other students from the same school are playing a game of mahjong.

Jantei Monogatari is a hybrid of a traditional-style Japanese adventure game and a regular mahjong game. The player takes the role of the unnamed private investigator, and moves from place to place via menus, talking to different characters. The investigation happens through playing mahjong with each suspect: win and they'll tell you a bit more of what they know. At first, the investigator can only speak with the three girls in the photo, but as he wins games of mahjong against them, he gains information and experience that allow him to find new clues and talk to more suspects. The investigator will need to play against a dozen different opponents in his attempt to find out what happened to the kidnapped girl.</desc>

It is a platform game with a lot of various levels: jungle, underwater, volcanic caves, on the ice... Toki's only weapons are spitting on the enemies or jumping on them and crashing them. There are many possibilities to upgrade his spitting "weapon"; for example, if he finds an upgrade, he can spit fireballs. 

This game is ported from an older arcade version.</desc>
	<path>./Jurassic Park (Japan).bin</path>
	<desc>The Sega Genesis game based on the Jurassic Park movie/book differs from the games made by Ocean for other platforms. Basically, Sega's Jurassic Park is a side-scrolling action game.  You jump from platform to platform, pick up weapons and health items, and try to make it to the end of the level with all your lives intact.

This version of Jurassic Park does feature an interesting twist, however. You can play it either as Dr. Grant, or as a Velociraptor. The story and level design changes based on which character you use.</desc>

The title refers to your shapeshifting abilities. In this platformer, you can collect spirit balls by defeating two-headed wolves, allowing you to mutate into different beasts such as a werewolf, a dragon, a tiger, a bear and others depending on the version. Each form, tied to a level, comes with special abilities such as flight and powerful attacks, easily superseding the basic set of punches and kicks in your human form.

The game can be played in singleplayer mode, or in same-screen multiplayer co-op mode.</desc>

	<path>./Killing Game Show, The (Japan).bin</path>
	<desc>This is a vertical platformer with horizontal wrap-around. For the entertainment of the futuristic masses, you play a criminal that has been inserted into a mechanical body with the promise that if you succeed in surviving through all the levels (there are many and they are hard), you will be set free.
You start each level at the bottom, near pooling liquid which will soon rise, at your immediate peril. Navigate the level from bottom to the exit at the top before the liquid rises and kills you. There are many other foes that fly around, causing you damage and basically annoying you to spit.
Most levels must be navigated through a series of keyed gates, doors, or portals. These shaped keys are scattered around the map and must by picked up and used only on the gates they match individually.
Twist: You can only carry one special weapon (triple shot, laser beam, or vertical shot) and one tool (key, liquid-freeze, or a red herring) at a time.
This game requires a lot of memorization of enemy movement patterns and optimum routes.
A unique feature is that when you die, you can watch a replay and take over at any point to continue your game.
You can also hit the HELP button at the start of each level to view a map, helping you plan your route.</desc>

	<desc>"Langrisser II" is a sequel to  Warsong (whose original title is Langrisser). The events of the game take place several years after those described in "Warsong". Gone is the benevolent kingdom of Baltia, and a new power has risen - the Rayguard Empire, led by Emperor Bernhart and his four generals. Recently, Bernhart ordered his army to attack the neighboring countries, obviously searching for something. This "something" might be none else but a legendary evil sword, that makes the one who wields undefeated. It is up to the noble knight Elwin and his friends to stop the Emperor!

"Langrisser II" is a strategy RPG. The army is divided into soldier units and generals, who fight alone and who are usually stronger than a whole unit. Before the scenario begins, you must hire soldiers, buy weapons and items, etc. During the battle, if you come into contact with an enemy unit, an automatic battle sequence occurs. You can also cast healing spells on your units or offensive spells to hurt the enemy.

The major difference between "Langrisser II" and its "remake", Der Langrisser for SNES, is the absence of branching storyline in Genesis release.</desc>

	<desc>"Langrisser II" is a sequel to  Warsong (whose original title is Langrisser). The events of the game take place several years after those described in "Warsong". Gone is the benevolent kingdom of Baltia, and a new power has risen - the Rayguard Empire, led by Emperor Bernhart and his four generals. Recently, Bernhart ordered his army to attack the neighboring countries, obviously searching for something. This "something" might be none else but a legendary evil sword, that makes the one who wields undefeated. It is up to the noble knight Elwin and his friends to stop the Emperor!

"Langrisser II" is a strategy RPG. The army is divided into soldier units and generals, who fight alone and who are usually stronger than a whole unit. Before the scenario begins, you must hire soldiers, buy weapons and items, etc. During the battle, if you come into contact with an enemy unit, an automatic battle sequence occurs. You can also cast healing spells on your units or offensive spells to hurt the enemy.

The major difference between "Langrisser II" and its "remake", Der Langrisser for SNES, is the absence of branching storyline in Genesis release.</desc>

	<desc>From NCS (the makers of Assault Suit Leynos, Assault Suit Valken, Gynoug, and Shubibinman) comes Mamono Hunter Yoko: Dai 7 no Keisho (or Devil Hunter Yoko: The Seven Bells), one of the only games based on the anime/manga devil slayer of the same name. Devil Hunter Yoko is about Yoko Mano, who was a regular girl making her way through high school--until she learned that she is the 108th successor to a line of warriors charged with defending the earth against demons. 

Every woman born into the Mano family has taken up the role of the legendary Devil Hunters, warriors who battle demons and other forces of darkness who threaten Earth. The realm of the demons (which is parallel to our world) is in cross-dimensional alignment with our own, which could cause a portal to open, allowing the demons to cross over, and launch an all-out attack. The demons are trying to destroy Yoko before she can take her rightful place as the 108th generation Devil Hunter. She must stop the demons before they can perform the ritual that will mean the end of the human race.

Mamono Hunter Yoko: Dai 7 no Keisho is a side scrolling action/platformer game along the lines of Valis. You control Yoko who is equipped with a sword, which you use to slash your enemies. Also if you hold the attack button you can create a shield which will block weak attacks. The shield can also then be thrown to attack enemies. You play through various different worlds, such as a plant type stage, a water stage, a cave stage, a snow stage, etc.

He sends his adoptive son to visit the king of the country, to follow the way of the warrior - and perhaps to discover his true origins...

This is a traditional Japanese RPG set in a medieval environment, with randomly appearing enemies whom you fight in turn-based style, viewing the battle field from first-person perspective. During your journey through the country you'll meet other characters who will join your party. There is a night/day cycle in the game.

	<path>./Megapanel (Japan).bin</path>
	<desc>Megapanel is a tile-based puzzle game that plays like a mixture of Tetris Attack and a traditional sliding tile puzzle. Blocks rise from the bottom of a well, and the player must slide them around in order to create a row or column of three same-color blocks. This causes the group to clear, and potentially create chains from the blocks above falling. As the game continues, the number of blocks that must be cleared to continue as well as the speed at which the stack rises will both increase.

The game includes three modes. First is training mode which explains the basics of the game. In this mode, a certain number of blocks must be cleared to complete the stage. Second is a "pin-up" mode for one player, where clearing blocks reveals parts of an image of a cute anime girl, the goal being to uncover the entire picture. Last is a two-player versus mode, where players compete to clear their blocks the fastest, and can send garbage blocks to their opponent and fill up their field. The game includes two difficulty settings, two versus modes, a sound test, and a unique mode that displays the entire game in sepia tone.</desc>

	<path>./Metal Fangs (Japan).bin</path>
	<desc>Metal Fangs is a unique futuristic battle driving game, where the player controls a team of racers and must attempt to destroy the competing team. Each "race" is made up of two heats of two parts each, and hits or kills on the other team earns points. During each heat, each team takes one turn attacking (four vehicles on the course) and one turn defending (three vehicles on the course). The team with the most points at the end of the last heat wins a reward and moves on to the next match.

However, your team won't get very far with just its basic equipment. After choosing your team's colors and members, you must then purchase upgrades for each person: engines, fuel, AI, armor, and of course weapons. During the game, you can switch freely between each member of your team. Your vehicle automatically moves forward around the track, but you can turn, throttle, and brake in order to move closer to or escape from the other team.

After each successful match there is a game of chance where winnings can be increased. There is also a two-player simultaneous battle mode.</desc>

She can also use items and equip weapons and armor, talk to people, and open treasure chests. Later in the game, she will also be able to use magic, and a little blue pet animal will assist and help her on her journey. The combat system is very similar to the classical Zelda style. Health and mana points are measured in little hearts, and the more you progress in the game, the more hit points you gain.

	<path>./Mutant League Football (Japan).bin</path>
	<desc>Futuristic, intergalactic war disguised as American Football, Mutant League Football was one of the most unique football games ever to hit the gaming market. It's a unique blend of sports and sci-fi, and the actual football is the good ol' smash-mouth kind, literally.

Dynamite throwing running backs, blitzing trolls, robots that bleed oil, it's all here. Opposing quarterback connecting on too many passes? Blitz him 'til he's dead. Suspect the ref's been bribed by the other side? Call a Kill Ref audible; it's a 5 yard penalty though. 

Take your pick from nineteen teams, including three All-Star teams. There are five difficulty levels and a slow/fast game speed toggle. A tournament mode awaits those who want something more than a quick game versus the computer or a friend.

There are nineteen different fields to play on, all with there own special quirks. The Hellfield is littered with mines and fire pits to put an end to a careless runner, while The Pen is a slippery sheet of ice.</desc>

	<desc>One day, a kiwi tribe was having fun and games outside the zoo, only to be kidnapped by the evil-minded Leopard Seal, who plans to sell them at the black market. Fortunately, during the kidnapping process, Tiki, leader of the tribe, managed to escape the sack, and her job is to rescue Phee-Phee and the other kiwis scattered around New Zealand, and are held in cages in various locations that include Auckland, Rotorua, Waitomo Caves, Strait Cook, and Mt. Cook. 

If Tiki doesn't rescue a kiwi in a limited amount of time, the devil will appear and try to kill her. When Tiki reaches the outskirts of each city, except Strait Cook, there is a boss waiting to meet Tiki, and kill her by using their own choice of weapons. Also making the rescue mission difficult are several nasties that attempt to throw their own weapons, like bombs and arrows, at her. To defeat these enemies, Tiki shoots at them using her crossbow and arrows. More often than not, when Tiki shoots at enemies, they will leave behind pieces of fruit that she can pick up for points. However, it is likely that Tiki may get other weapons or the letters E, X, T, E, N, and D. Collecting all these letters will result in an extra life, and as for the weapons, they include laser shots, bombs, and fireballs. 

In some levels, a few areas are located further up than just left or right, and the only way that Tiki can go up is by snatching something off the enemy that gives her the ability to fly up. Other areas are underwater, and when Tiki goes underwater, her oxygen meter decreases, so she has to rise up to the surface again to restore her oxygen levels. Apart from her own weapons, Tiki is able to squirt water at enemies if she gets to the top of the water.</desc>

C selects a ninja/confirms an action. B cancels an action, or if no action is in progress, selects the next ninja. A opens the battle menu, which allows you to end your turn.

Fortune tells that very soon, the person who will stop the evils of this pachinko parlor will appear, and Chen's daughter, Ren, sets out on her 18th birthday for Yokohama, looking for her father.

Pachinko Kuunyan is a pachinko RPG much like the Pachio-kun series. The player controls Ren as in a standard role-playing game, but rather than fighting battles, she can enter pachinko halls and play the machines. Each of the five cities has several pachinko halls, and Ren must empty out a certain number of machines before she can move on to the next city.

Unlike most other fighting games, you can control only one character (Joe) in single-player mode. In two-player mode, you can choose to fight as any of the seven available fighters, and also choose a scenery. The game plays like a standard 2D fighter: you can punch, kick, and jump on you opponents, but the fights are not entirely 2D, since you can also take a few steps vertically.</desc>

Some of these are the U.Z. canon, cruise missiles, and speed boost. Your car has a very limited amount of fuel, however more can be picked up along the way by crossing the halfway point of a level, or by collecting the red and green fuel spheres that appear in the road or after destroying certain enemies. On many levels collecting fuel is critical otherwise you won't be able to reach the finish line.</desc>
	<path>./RoboCop versus The Terminator (Japan).bin</path>
	<desc>The Dark Horse comic book crossover of the two famous 80s cyborgs spawned various different game adaptations. RoboCop versus The Terminator on the Genesis is only loosely based on the comic.

The player controls RoboCop who during his duty of policing the streets of Detroit is lured into a trap by Terminators sent from the future. By uploading himself into the computer network, he becomes the seed from which the malevolent Skynet grows. Years later, in the post-apocalyptic future, RoboCop is reactivated and must help the human resistance by attacking and defeating Skynet once and for all.

The game is a platformer with heavy shooting elements and consists of 10 levels. Many enemies stand in RoboCop's way and must be destroyed via 8 different weapons. RoboCop begins the game with only a basic pistol, but other weapons can be found, including flame and grenade throwers, laser guns, self-seeking missiles and others. While all guns have unlimited ammo, only two can be carried at the same time and being killed means the currently equipped gun is lost.

The game is evenly split between present and future levels. Enemies in present Detroit include mostly street punks and other criminal elements while the future is of course populated by deadly machines: Terminators, robotic dogs and spiders and many automated guns. Each level ends with a boss battle, featuring Terminators, heavy tanks and RoboCop's famous adversaries ED-209 and Cain (aka RoboCop 2).

Some levels feature optional goals besides getting to the exit, like freeing hostages or destroying security cameras.

	<desc>In the early part of the 20th century, a group of evil poachers recklessly hunted animals to the point of extinction, including lions, deers, elephants, eagles, and several others.

Growl is a one-player game, in which you control one of four characters (Gen, Burn, Khan, and Jack) and you must defeat these evil poachers by dealing with them with your fists. However, there are weapons that can be found, including grenades, rocket launchers, whips, swords, guns, and shotguns, which you get once an enemy drops them on the ground, so you can use these weapons against them. If you manage to get one of the guns, you can shoot enemies with a limited supply of ammo. Once the ammo runs out, your only option is to pistol-whip them.

Also, you can pick up crates and barrels and haul it at enemies to knock them down. Along the way, you'll encounter several cases of animal cruelty, such as two men whipping a lion. Stop the animal cruelty, and the animals will help you in your quest to defeat these evil poachers.</desc>

As they go deeper and deeper they will find clues as to who ordered the kidnapping, the Sakazaki family's relation to the mob, and a person from their past.

This fighting game is a coin-op conversion of the Neo-Geo hit of the same name, and has all characters, stages, and moves featured in the arcade unit. Unlike the original arcade version, players can now play as Mr. Big and the elusive Mr. Karate.

The gameplay differs from most fighting games. In this game, you have a Spirit meter. A Spirit meter is in the game and will decrease as you perform special moves. It can be recharged, but doing so leaves you open to attack. When your health is almost gone, you can perform a secret combination that will unleash a deadly attack on your opponent - provided you have a full Spirit meter.</desc>

	<desc>Fire Shark takes place around a small island in the South Pacific.  It is a continuously-scrolling aerial shooter with a top-down view.  Your World War II era biplane has been modified to shoot lasers and drop powerful bombs. 

There are ten levels in the game in which you will face aerial, aquatic, and ground enemies. They all fire scores of missiles at you in an attempt to knock you from the sky. 

In between levels, your plane will land on a runway for refueling and maintenance. You will receive bonus points for the number of bombs left in your hold and the number of lightning bolt icons you picked up in the prior level.

There are also many power-ups available in each level. Slow-moving blimps contain a power-up icon which is revealed after the zeppelin explodes. Other icons appear when various other enemies or buildings are destroyed. These power-ups will float around the screen for several seconds. Grabbing them with your plane earns you a weapon upgrade or bonus points.

The standard weapons are the bomb and the Wide Shot. As power-ups are obtained the number of shots per blast can increase up to 16. The Wide Shot is a comparatively weak weapon that usually requires multiple hits to take an enemy down.

The Shark Beam is a green laser that fires in a spiral pattern and the strongest weapon of all is the Super Fire. It will fire continuously while the fire button is held. Power-ups increase its beam count to 4.</desc>

The game is a first person RPG, with turn-based combat and cartoony graphics. The dialogue is displayed via dialog bubbles appearing above the characters speaking, although the protagonist never speaks.

Ashura, the King of an alien race hailing from the Evil World, decides that this is the perfect time to strike the vulnerable unprotected Earth.  It just so happens that one of the good gods, Hyperion, takes pity on the humans and decides to bestow his power to four of the strongest Earth warriors so they can go and defeat Ashura and his minions.

The player takes control of these four warriors who are Leo, a fencer, Marco, a monk, and Horatio and Tiffany, whom are both ninjas (one male, one female). Each character fires their own type of weapon and each character can charge up their weapon to make it a more powerful shot. All the characters also have a special weapon that can clear all the enemies on the screen but with the caveat that it can only be used once per stage. Each character also has a jump and speed attribute which when powered up allows them to jump higher and walk faster. Players can switch between all of the characters during a stage.

The game has 9 different stages. The player can play the first six (mountain,harbor,street,future,glen, and forest) in any order. Each round ends with a boss which must be defeated to clear that round.</desc>

He walks right in, and takes on the first guy in a karate gi he comes across...

Shura no Mon is a so-called "command action" game based on the manga by Masatoshi Kawahara. The player controls Tsukumo by selecting commands from a list, using different attacks and defensive maneuvers at the appropriate time, with the results shown via brief animated sequences. Between bouts, lightly-animated visual scenes progress the story. The plot closely follows the first arc from the manga, starting with Tsukumo's arrival at the legendary Jinmukan dojo.</desc>

The basic gameplay is identical: a vertically-scrolling shooter where power-ups cycle through a list to choose from, and it is possible to construct massively-wide ships with incredible firepower. Slap Fight MD also adds the ability to jettison your ship's power-ups causing a massive screen-filling explosion that can potentially save your life.</desc>

Snow Bros. is a fixed-screen platform game where players must defeat all enemies on each level (screen), 50 altogether. The Snow Bros use snow as their weapon, throwing it at the enemies to stun them. When lots of snow is thrown at an enemy, it becomes covered in a flurry and unable to move. These can be rolled into giant snowballs and pushed or kicked into other enemies. If left alone, enemies will eventually defrost and become angry at the player. The enemy filled snowballs are a much stronger weapon then the regular handful of snow and are the only effective weapon Nick and Tom have against the bosses.</desc>

The player controls Stevedore, a warehouse keeper, from a top-down view. As shown on the title screen, shoving boxes will earn him money to make his dreams come true, a lovely girlfriend and a fiery red sports car.

The game consists of 16 stages with 10 rounds each. At a certain stage, any of the 10 rounds can be selected while playing but a new stage will only be opened up when all rounds have been successfully completed. To complete a round, Stevedore needs to push all boxes on the designated spots. This will turn them into a different colour. This is no easy task as the level design will obstruct many moves and cornered boxes can no longer be moved. While playing it is possible to restart the round, undo the last step and the game keeps track of the number of steps taken.

The game supports passwords and includes an edit mode where new levels can be designed and played.</desc>

	<desc>Sonic Eraser is a puzzle game very similar to Columns that features Sega mascot Sonic the Hedgehog. Pieces in different arrangements drop into a well; if two or more matching pieces touch, they disappear and the above pieces fall to take their place. There are four different single-player game modes:

1. Round: Each stage starts with pieces in the well already. There are several spinning green pieces, which must all be destroyed to finish the stage.

2. Normal: A standard endless mode in which the game speed continually rises as matches are made.

3. Doubt: No white-colored blocks will appear in the drop formations, but often a random block in the formation will change to a white block after it is placed.

4. Block: Similar to Normal mode, but blocks will not fall out of formation until a match is made, allowing for impressive clear combos.

These modes can be played either single player or two-player simultaneous on separate fields. There is also a versus mode for one or two players, in which creating a combo of three or more clears will attack the opposing player, which causes them to lose control of their pieces for a short time.</desc>

</desc>
	<path>./Sonic the Hedgehog (Japan).bin</path>
	<desc>Sonic the Hedgehog is the first of many games starring Sega's premier rodent, Sonic. It's a side scrolling platform game with a difference: speed. Sonic rushes through levels with incredible speed, allowing him to traverse loops and jumps with ease. 

The plot of the game is simple. The evil Dr. Robotnik has captured many of Sonic's animal friends, and trapped them inside robots. Fortunately, Sonic can free his friends by destroying the robots with his spin attack. Meanwhile, Dr. Robotnik is trying to control the all-powerful chaos emeralds. Sonic must grab them before he does in the 3D rotating bonus levels. 

Sonic's weapon is his spin attack; while jumping, Sonic destroys hostile robots by touch. Throughout the platforming levels, Sonic collects numerous rings. If Sonic is hit by an enemy, all the rings he's carrying fall out and scatter around; Sonic can quickly grab the rings back before they disappear. If Sonic is hit while not carrying any rings, he dies. Collecting 100 rings gives Sonic an extra life. There is also an invincibility bonus which temporarily protects Sonic from all attacks. 

The game is divided into several "zones", each of them containing three levels. At the end of each zone Sonic confronts Dr. Robotnik in a boss fight. 

Sonic the Hedgehog is a significant game because it gave Sega it's first real mascot, and established the Genesis as the video game system with "attitude."</desc>

	<desc>Dr. Robotnik's Death Egg has crash-landed on Floating Island, so called because it harnesses the power of the Chaos Emeralds to float in the air.  Robotnik needs them to repair the Death Egg, so he tells the guardian of Floating Island, Knuckles the Echidna, that Sonic and Tails are there to steal them. With Knuckles tricked and trying to stop the heroes at every turn, will they be able to stop Robotnik in time?

Sonic the Hedgehog 3 is the third in the Sonic series of games. As with the previous games, it is a side-scrolling platformer based around speed. The basic game remains the same - players collect rings to earn extra lives, which are also used for protection, and scatter everywhere when Sonic is hurt. Sonic can jump on enemies to defeat them, and Spin Dash by holding down and the jump button, then letting go of down.

New to Sonic 3 are three different types of shields - the Fire Shield (which protects you from fire but disappears if you enter water), the Water Shield (which lets you breathe underwater infinitely) and the Electric Shield (which pulls nearby rings towards you). Sonic can use extra abilities when he has these shields by pressing jump while in the air - either a horizontal fireball dash, a vertical bubble bounce, or an electric double jump. If Sonic has no shield active, he can activate a brief energy shield, also by pressing jump in the air. Tails cannot use the shields' special abilities, but he can instead either fly or dog paddle (in water) for a limited time. He can also carry Sonic with him while doing so.

There are now two types of bonus stages - one is available by collecting 50 or more rings, running past a checkpoint lamppost and then jumping into the stars (as you could in Sonic the Hedgehog 2. This stage give you the chance to earn bonus rings, lives and power-ups. In this stage, there is a giant gumball machine. By hitting the crank, you'll spit out a bonus item that can either be rings, lives or bonus shields. The stage is over when you fall down the bottom of the screen.

The other, more important, Special Stage can be accessed by jumping into giant rings that are hidden away in secret areas in each level. In these stages, you must collect all the blue spheres while avoiding the red ones (which end the stage early). Collecting all of the outer blue spheres around square or rectangle sphere formations will turn them all into rings - if you collect 50 or more in this stage, you can earn a continue. Once you collect all the blue spheres in the stage, it clears and you earn one of the seven Chaos Emeralds.

Sonic 3 features six different Zones, which are made up of two Acts. At the end of each Act is a boss that must be defeated to complete the stage and rescue Sonic's animal friends that Robotnik has captured to turn into Badnik robots. The zones in Sonic 3 are approximately three times bigger than those in Sonic 2, and feature multiple, branching paths.

As with Sonic 2, there is a two-player Vs. Mode, which plays in a split-screen horizontal style. There are special monitor pick-ups in this mode which do things like swap player positions, lose rings, or cause a Badnik to appear. You can also race against the clock in a time trial mode.</desc>

	<desc>Sorcerer's Kingdom is a mix of RPG and strategy game. You play a young adventurer, who is sent out by the king to find out the reason for the increasing number of monsters that threaten the land and restore peace to the kingdom. Starting out as an Adventurer you are eventually given higher titles by the king, as a reward for completing quests. 

The game plays like a typical RPG but the battles are a little unusual. Whenever you are attacked or attack a monster that is within your current range, a turn-based battle starts immediately without taking you to a separate fighting area, and you have to fight all enemies that were visible the moment the battle started.</desc>
	<path>./Sorcerian (Japan).bin</path>
	<desc>Sorcerian is the fifth game in the Dragon Slayer series. It is set in the fantasy land known as Pentawa, whose inhabitants are in constant need of protection from ferocious creatures roaming the wilderness. The king of Pentawa hires a party of adventurers, and their first assignment is to retrieve a precious sceptre from a dungeon, where it is guarded by the evil demonic lord Ouks.

The game is an RPG with an unusual side-scrolling perspective and action-based combat, somewhat of a cross between Wizardry and platform games. Despite being a Japanese game, Sorcerian resembles Western RPGs of its time, focusing more on character development than story. In the beginning, the player creates a party of four characters, choosing between fighter, wizard, elf, and dwarf (races and classes are not distinguished). Beside the usual inns and shops, there are many things that can be done in the towns of the game, including complex development of magical spells (up to 120 spells of different disciplines), training to raise personal skills (strength, intelligence, etc.), enchanting weapons with elemental magic, as well as looking for part-time jobs.

The view switches to side-scrolling when the party ventures into a hostile area. Combat is performed in real time, with the player controlling the entire party at once. The lead character can be changed at any time, and battle actions will be carried out by whoever is in front. Melee attacks and magic spells are unleashed by pressing corresponding buttons. The characters can also jump and interact with objects by bumping into them. Dungeons are usually maze-like, and some contain simple puzzles such as finding and activating hidden switches to open doors.</desc>

The game is played on a large map made up of hexagonal spaces, each of which is a specific type of terrain. Each player controls a number of units, which each take up one space on the grid. Different units have different strengths and weaknesses toward other units, which are also affected by the terrain. Each player controls a capital, and the goal is to capture the other players' capitals.</desc>

There is also a "doubles" mode, where two players work together to fill lines in an extra-wide well, each controlling their own pieces simultaneously.

	<path>./Time Dominator 1st (Japan).bin</path>
	<desc>A fast-paced platform game in the vein of the classic Sonic the Hedgehog. The evil overlord Time Dominator has constructed a time machine and is using it to steal treasures from the past, creating a warp in the flow of time. The Time Warp Patrol, created to prevent this sort of thing from happening, sends the special time-traveling duck Socket (or Minutes in the Japanese version) to fix the flow of time and stop Time Dominator.

Socket has reasonably basic abilities: he can jump, kick to the side or straight upward, and run quite fast. As Socket is a robot, his energy level continually drains from simply being in operation; thankfully, there are a liberal amount of electric bolts strewn about each stage, which will refill his health when picked up. Getting hit by enemies will take a chunk out of his life bar.

There are seven different themed zones, each with four separate parts. First up is the High Speed Zone, which is a gateway level leading to the next zone, and as the name suggests it encourages high speed play. Next is the Athletic Zone, which generally entails lots of jumping, and the Labyrinth Zone, which is focused on exploration and simply finding a path to the exit. At the end of each Labyrinth Zone, Socket faces off against Time Dominator in a boss round, then moves on to the next High Speed Zone.

The game also features a sound test mode and a time trial mode, where the High Speed Zone stages can be played without any enemies present with times being recorded.</desc>

Several characters join him on his quest: Kazuma Kuwabara, his ex-rival and best friend; Kurama, a 1400-year-old demon fox; and Hiei, formerly a demon who tried to conquer the world and had to repent for his sins by helping Yuusuke.

You must play the individual chapters of the four playable characters (Yuusuke, Kuwabara, Kurama, and Hiei), until in the final chapter you control them all in the ultimate confrontation against evil forces. The game is a Japanese-style adventure (no puzzles, menu-driven interface) with the addition of battles. The battles are real time; similarly to fighting games, you can kick, punch, defend, and use special techniques. Unlike most Japanese adventures, you view the game world from platform-like third person perspective (although you cannot move physically in adventure mode).

	<path>./Zan Yasha Enbuden (Japan).bin</path>
	<desc>Zan: Yasha Enbukyoku is a turn-based strategy game set in feudal Japan.

The background for the game's events is the ongoing battle between noble warriors, known as yasha, and demons. Between the two stand the "middle people", i.e. other Japanese generals and rulers. The player can choose to play as either yasha, demonic, or "middle" army. 

The player has to manage his army, deploying units for protection and attack, as well as negotiating with other rulers. Events such as earthquakes, plagues, etc. occur randomly. Diplomacy doesn't always work, so battles against enemy armies occupy a large portion of the game. The battles are somewhat similar to those of turn-based RPGs (though the game has no RPG elements): the player chooses commands from a menu, such as attack, use magic, use special technique, use a battle formation, etc. There is no active movement during the battles. The outcome of the battle depends on the chosen commands as well as on the strength of the units.</desc>
	<path>./Zero Wing (Japan).bin</path>
	<desc>Zero Wing is an horizontal shooter game where the player is in control of a ZIG, an escape pod released after its main ship was attacked and destroyed by the evil cyborg CATS, bent on taking over the world.

Like most games in the genre, there are three color-coded weapons: red (scatter), green (homing) and blue (lasers). Each weapon has three levels of power, and to obtain those, similar upgrades must be collected sequentially. However, what makes the game unique is the ability to use a traction beam to trap an enemy and then throw him against his peers, destroying them.

The game (or the European PAL version) is best known for being the origin of the infamous "All Your Base" 2001 Internet meme.</desc>

	<path>./[SegaNet] 16t (Japan).gen</path>
	<desc>16t is a scrolling platform action game similar to Teddy Boy, in which the player controls a youngster in prison garb named Apple Gaikichi, who must eliminate all the enemies on each stage. Apple's only method of attack is throwing enormous 16 ton weights (thus the title), which can and will crush enemies in a bloody mess. However, these weights will bounce off each other, so the player must be careful to not let Apple get crushed himself. They are also not entirely unlimited, as the player can only hold five at once, and they must be allowed to recharge when Apple runs out. Enemies on each stage will appear from the top of the screen in waves, through a randomly cycling "slots" meter, and once all slots and enemies have been cleared, the player moves on to the next stage.</desc>

	<desc>A Ressha de Ikou MD is a real-time railroad simulation game, and part of the A-Train series from Artdink. Based on the first two games in the series, in each scenario the player must use the resources at hand to build a railroad connecting from one end of a map to the other. During the day, the titular "A-Train" can be controlled, by which the player can build tracks and stations. During the night, train schedules can be modified. As the player builds, development will spring up around the tracks and stations, bringing in income by which more tracks and stations can be built.

The game offers a total of five different scenarios of increasing difficulty, ranging from a practice scenario for beginners to very difficult scenarios for experienced players. There are also three different game speed settings available.</desc>

Every level ends with a boss and some section speed up the gameplay, offering fast obstacle courses both horizontally and vertically scrolling. Flying orange pods release many power-ups at once, enhancing the ships with new or more powerful lasers, wing men and shields. The player can also hold the fire key to charge a blast that removes all enemy bullets from the screen and deals damage to all enemies. With an unforgiving difficulty, every hit is fatal, but the game can be continued from any points as long as there are lives and credits left. The game can be played with two players cooperatively.

	<desc>Similar to its predecessor, the premise of After Burner II is to get on the F-14 Tomcat and fly mission after mission of shooting planes out of the sky. At your disposal is a vulcan cannon (basically a machine gun) and a limited number of missiles. In some versions of the game the guns fire automatically all the time. Sometimes you come across a friendly supply plane and if you dock with it you can replenish your missiles.

The game is viewed from behind the plane with you fighting wave after wave of enemy fighters. But at heart it offers the usual shooter mechanics, meaning you spend most of your time dodging and shooting. You also can speed up and slow down to deal with enemies which appear behind you.</desc>
	<path>./Aladdin (Japan).gen</path>
	<desc>The game from Virgin based on the 1992 animated Disney film is a side-scrolling platformer.

The player controls Aladdin, who must make his way through several levels based on locations from the movie: from the streets and rooftops of Agrabah, the Cave of Wonders and the Sultan's dungeon to the final confrontation in Grand Vizier Jafar's palace. The Sultan's guards and also animals of the desert want to hinder Aladdin in his way. He can defend himself with his sword or by throwing apples. Next to apples, Aladdin can also collect gems which can be traded for lives and continues with a traveling trader. Finding Genie or Abu icons enables bonus rounds. The Genie bonus round is a game of luck played for apples, gems or extra lives. In Abu's bonus round, the player controls the little monkey who has to catch bonus items that fall from the sky, but without touching any of the unwanted objects like rocks and pots.

The game's humorous animations were created by Walt Disney Feature Animation.

	<path>./Alisia Dragoon (Japan).gen</path>
	<desc>Alisia Dragoon is the female protagonist of this fast-paced platform game. Alisia must destroy an evil demon and avenge her fathers death through eight stages. She has only one weapon to dispose of enemies: thunder magic. This magic is auto-aiming and can track multiple targets. However, the game is quite hard as the levels are loaded with fantasy-inspired monsters. Using thunder magic reduces a magic gauge, meaning you often have to wait for it to recharge. Once fully charged Alisia can unleash a massive rolling blast of lightning across the screen.

During the game, you can improve your magic by picking up potions. There are also four monsters which accompany Alisia: Dragon Frye, Ball O'Fire, Thunder Raven and Boomerang Lizard. Each has different abilities, deciding which, if any, to use in a given situation is part of the challenge. These monsters, like Alisia herself, are fully upgradeable with power-ups. They can also die if weakened too much, forcing you to hunt for a reviving power-up. You can pause the game and select your companion at any time.</desc>

	<desc>Genki's first game is a paddle/pong game with a background story. Once upon a time there were a prince and a princess who loved each other. But the evil jealous demon named "Y" turn them both into stone paddles. Suddenly, a blue sphere fell from the sky, becoming the ball which the paddles can now push forwards, overcoming obstacles and defeating demons.

"Devilish" is different from other paddle games by letting you play with two paddles. The lower one behaves just like a usual paddle - you use it to prevent the ball from dropping down. The upper one can move and turn, allowing you to hit the ball from different angles and from different parts of the screen. You advance through levels by destroying bricks and enemies, going up until the level boss enemy appears.</desc>

	<path>./Bare Knuckle - Ikari no Tetsuken - Streets of Rage (World) (Rev A).gen</path>
	<desc>Streets of Rage, Sega's answer to Final Fight, follows the story of three young police officers (Adam Hunter, Axel Stone and Blaze Fielding) in a city controlled by a criminal syndicate led by a "Mr. X" where crime is rampant, which leads the three heroes to make a pact to leave the force and topple the syndicate by themselves.

Gameplay is straightforward and simple. Three buttons are used, one to jump, other to attack and another to perform a range attack from a support police car. Each character has a limited set of moves that include punching and kicking or performing a back attack (if in the open), two grapple moves (depending if holding the opponent in front or by the back), a flying attack, and if playing with another player two additional tag attacks, and different abilities: Adam is slow, but a good jumper and a hard hitter, Axel fast and also a hard hitter, but a lousy jumper and Blaze fast and a good jumper, but weak hitter.
Levels are in typical arcade side-scroller fashion: move from left to right (with two exceptions), clearing screens from enemies one after another as fast as possible while avoid taking damage with a boss in the end. Some levels feature "death drops" where the player must avoid falling, while throwing enemies there at the same time, including a typical elevator level. Several items are scattered on the ground, from melee weapons and bonus points (and lives or additional police cars) to apples and turkeys (to restore health).</desc>
	<path>./Bare Knuckle II (Japan).gen</path>
	<desc>After Axel Stone, Blaze Fielding and Adam Hunter destroyed the evil Syndicate leader, Mr. X, the city became a peaceful place to live, and each one of them followed their own paths. One year later, after their reunion, Adam's brother Sammy returned from school to find their apartment in a mess, and Adam nowhere to be seen, and after calling his two friends, one of them notices a photo of Adam chained to a wall, next to someone they knew very well - Mr. X, who returned to turn the peaceful city once again into a war zone. Now, Axel, Blaze, Sammy, and Axel's good friend Max, a pro wrestler, must head out to stop Mr. X once again...hopefully for good...

Streets of Rage 2 differs from the previous title in several ways. There are changes in both graphics (characters now are bigger, more detailed and with more animation frames, and scenarios are less grainy) and gameplay (the rocket move was replaced by a special move that doubles in offense and defense along several new moves), along other new features such as life bars (and names) for all enemies and the radically different new characters.</desc>
	<path>./Bare Knuckle III (Japan).gen</path>
	<desc>In part three of the Streets of Rage series, Mr. X is back and this time his plan involves replacing public officials with his own robots. Only Axel, Blaze, Skate, and new-comer Dr. Zan can stop him. Streets of Rage 3 features all of the beat 'em up action you would expect from a Streets of Rage game. One new feature is the special move power bar, where it only costs energy to do a special move if the bar isn't full. Also new is the ability to do special maneuvers with different weapons, depending on the character. For example, Skate has no special move with the pipe, but does have one with the knife. The opposite is true for Axel. Any weapon Dr. Zan picks up is turned into energy balls which he can throw at the enemies. Secret characters and multiple endings add replay value.</desc>
	<path>./Batman (Japan).gen</path>
	<desc>The Genesis version of Batman: The Video Game follows closely the plot from the 1989 movie.

The game consists in six stages, four of side-scrolling platform action and two side-scrolling shooter ones, in the following order: Gotham City Street, Axis Chemical Factory, Flugelheim Museum, Gotham City Street (with the Batmobile and after that on foot), In the Sky over Gotham City (with the Batwing) and the Cathedral, where Batman finally faces the Joker.

Batman can beat his enemies by punching them, slide kicking (by pressing down and the B button) or throwing his Batarang. By holding down the B button, Batman will block projectile-based attacks. He can also use his double jump (pressing the C button a second time while ascending) to leap greater distances or attack his enemies. To reach higher platforms, Batman can use his Grappling Hook (by pressing up and C to shoot, C again to climb). While piloting the Batmobile or the Batwing, Batman can shoot the Twin Vulcan Cannons (B button) or Twin Homing Missiles (A button).

Through the levels, Batman will collect Batman emblems (which will give him Batarangs or Twin Homing Missiles, depending on the stage played), Hearts (which give him health) and Batman heads (which give him an extra life).

	<path>./Battle Golfer Yui (Japan).gen</path>
	<desc>Gil Hazard, president of the Hazard Foundation, is secretly Professor G, the leader of the evil Dark Hazard organization. He has designs on world domination, and has plans to use the power of golf toward this end; this is the Battle Golfer project. Yui Mizuhara and Ran Ryuzaki are two ordinary high school girls who just so happen to be golf prodigies, and so are prime candidates for the Battle Golfer project. They are abducted by Professor G, but are rescued by a mysterious man before they can be taken under his control. Having escaped, Yui hears about a golf tournament being held by the Hazard Foundation, and suspecting more nefarious plans, she secretly enters the tournament to stop him for good.

Battle Golfer Yui is a unique genre fusion between a golf game and a Japanese-style adventure game. The main adventure mode casts the player as Yui competing in the Hazard Cup tournament. The player can interact with other characters on the course, and will need to defeat several different opponents at match play on oddly-themed courses in order to proceed. The system is quite simple and fast-paced; simply choose a direction, a club, spin, and hit the bar with the right timing to adjust shot power. Each character also has special abilities to help them out, but these are limited in use. There is also a regular golf mode for one or two players, offered as both stroke and match play.</desc>

	<desc>A one on one fighting game seen from an isometric perspective. All beasts or dragons have two basic attacks: a punch and a tail attack, as well as a special attack that can only be performed while a certain icon is displayed. During close combat, pressing the A or C button rapidly will result in a throwing or choking attack. There is no visible health bar, but three icons are displayed at the bottom of the screen. Once a dragon is knocked down for a longer moment, one icon turns red. Once all icons are red, the fight is lost. The battle arena is surrounded by an electric fence, that opponents can be thrown into and which can also be used to initiate jump attacks.

There are two modes of play: Match and Tournament. Match is a single match for one or two players, where several different dragons are available. Tournament sees the player starting out with a week dragon who has to fight increasingly difficult battles and increase his stats (Power, Speed and Stamina). After every other battle, a shop can be visited that offers different items including food that increases Power, Speed or Stamina, Data Disks that contain information on other Dragons and more. After visiting the shop, Dragons can be trained. The training consists of simply selecting an attribute to be increased. At a few points in the game, it is possible to splice the player's Dragon's genes which that of a defeated Opponent to gain different abilities.</desc>

	<desc>Championship Bowling is a standard bowling game for one or two players, and the only one available for the Genesis. The player picks one of four different bowlers and the ball they want to use, then heads out to the lanes. The player controls the throw, spin, and power by stopping bars at the right time.

The game includes three different play modes: standard bowling; spare mode, where a handful of pins are placed with the goal being to pick up a spare; and bonus mode, where specific pins are worth different amounts of points. Each mode can be played against either the computer or a friend, and there are three different lane types available. There is also a practice mode for each of the game types.

The Japanese version, Boogie Woogie Bowling, is largely the same but features different, more anime-style characters to play as (including a robot for no explained reason), as well as minor tweaks to the timing for throws.</desc>

Of course, it is up to our heroine to go on a solo mission, flying in her airbike around the Earth, fighting regular enemies and bosses, and ultimately saving the planet.

This is a pseudo-3D scrolling shooter similar to Space Harrier. The game is viewed from behind-the-character perspective. You can use regular fire attacks or limited super-powerful shots that do big damage.</desc>

	<desc>One windy day, there was an explosion at a nuclear power station, causing heavy doses of radiation to be poured over many people. One of these people was a young scientist named Chelnov. When he survived the deadly accident, he was possessed with abnormal powers. Having realized this, he decided to act in the cause of justice. He is determined to escape the Eastern Bloc country he called home and run and jump across the world to finish in the US.

What distinguishes Chelnov from other platform games is its use of forced scrolling. This occurs when the screen moves continuously from left to right, forcing players to negotiate the game's many obstacles and enemies without controlling Chelnov's speed of progress. Enemies attack from left, right, above, and below, and Chelnov can switch the direction he's facing to attack enemies that are behind him. Some enemies in the game carry different types of weapons and power-ups, and when they are shot at, the power-ups drop to the ground and can be picked up.</desc>

After finding what he's looking for, Shin-chan will move on to the next area.

Also included is a minigame mode with eight different minigames, such as a bubble-blowing contest, a three-legged race, and a desperate search for clothing before school. The entire game, including the minigames, is filled with dialogue containing the same humor as the source material.

At the heart of his ambition is the fair lady, Christiana, who is desired by the likely heir to the kingdom. Towards that end, Leon has been working hard to secure finances for his first ship. With the first step of his dream complete, Franco sails out with his father's good friend as first mate, you're off to find fame, adventure and fortunes out on the sea and in uncharted waters.

Uncharted Waters is a sailing and trading simulation. Your goal is initially to sail between ports and trade goods between them to make a profit. Along the way, you may be called upon by merchants and royalty to do specific tasks. Several different nations as well as pirates roam the sea and not all have good relations with one another. You can take as long as you want and explore as much of the world as possible to complete your ultimate task of marrying Christiana, which will require your fame rating to be quite high anyway. Available at most ports is a trader for cargo, a supply station for your crew's food and water as well as repairs, a shipbuilder, an item store and finally a pub for gaining information, crew and gambling.

All of the game progresses on an overhead-view, by sea you navigate your fleet by direction and can issue additional orders including landing on any piece of land to search for supplies. A variety of hazards live at sea including storms, other ships, seaweed and simply bad winds and currents.</desc>

	<desc>In the first Uncharted Waters game, it was the 15th century and the New World was discovered. Now in New Horizons, it is the early 16th century and the age of exploration and sea trade is underway. Players choose from any one of six adventurers (scenarios), each with their own distinctive but intertwining plot, to embark on a quest of sailing, seamanship and exploration. The six characters are:

1. Joao Franco is the son of Duke Leon Franco, the hero of the first Uncharted Waters game and an influential man in Portugal. His father wants to make him into a strong man and so decides to send him out to sea. Young Joao is tasked with learning the skills of the sailor (he is the only character who starts at level one) and embarking on a quest of discovery; reaching the far east and eventually looking for the secret of Atlantis.

2. Catalina Erantzo is a Spanish naval officer who believes her beloved and her brother were both murdered by the Portuguese armada. Vowing revenge she turns to a life of piracy and soon becomes a red haired scourge of the seas.

3. Pietro Conti is a indebted man, having inherited the financial woes of the Conti family. When the Duchess Franco hires him to spy on her son, he accepts the job and obtains a ship. Pietro hopes to use these resources to seek out valuable treasure and clear up his family's debt.

4. Ernst Von Bohr is a geographer who is teaching classes in Holland. But he yearns to leave the classroom and sail the high seas, living a life of adventure that he has only read about in books. When his friend, Mercator offers to finance his initial voyage in exchange for cartography information about the world, Ernst is given the opportunity to live out his dream.

5. Ali Vezas is a poor orphaned child living in Istanbul and serving others. He dreams of becoming his own master and making his own fortune across foreign lands. A twist of fate aides in providing him with small loans, with which he is able to afford his first ship and sail out with a cargo hold full of goods...

6. Otto Baynes styles himself a Royal Knight of the British Empire, in the service of his majesty the king. Promoted to Admiral of the British fleet, the kingdom is worried about the increased naval power of Spanish fleets. Otto is given a letter of marque by the king and ordered to terrorize the Spanish Fleet. Equipping himself simply at first, Otto strives to become a great Privateer in the name of King and Country.

Regardless of the character chosen, Uncharted Waters: New Horizons is a top-down sailing simulation. At sea, players control the direction of their ship, where speed is affected by the number/health of the crew, the wind and the currents. Players can navigate anywhere there is water (though some ships are not ocean worthy) and discover interesting landmarks and new ports. Upon landing at a port, the view is also top-down and the player can enter different buildings, each with unique services and goods. These include: The Inn, the Item Shop, The Shipyard, The Tavern, The Castle, The Guild Hall, The Church, The Merchant and the Harbor. It's up to the player to earn enough gold to keep the crew fed and financed and keep the fleet repaired. Primary methods of earning money are through sea trade, accepting jobs from the guild, gambling and battle with other ships.

During naval combat, the game becomes a turn-based top-down strategy game, with the player moving ships in order to obtain trajectories needed to fire cannons at enemy ships, or run alongside enemy vessels in order to board them. If the player's flagship attacks the flagship of the enemy fleet, they can challenge the opponent to a duel. If accepted, the game changes to a side-view of the two captains engaged in a fight. During this sequence, the player can only choose which fighting maneuver (strike, thrust, parry, lash) they wish to engage in.

	<path>./Dangerous Seed (Japan).gen</path>
	<desc>It is the 25th century, and the solar system has come under attack by an mysterious alien enemy known as Dangerous Seed. Human forces have been decimated, and the aliens' next target is Earth! The enemy draws closer to the frontline base on the moon by the hour, and the final line of defense for Earth, the fighter ship Moon Diver, has launched.

Dangerous Seed is a vertical scrolling shooter converted from the 1989 Namco coin-op. The player controls the three-part fighter ship Moon Diver through 12 stages to confront the alien menace and secure peace in the solar system. Each of the three parts of the ship, Alpha, Beta, and Gamma, have their own properties which can be combined in various ways. Each type and combination has multiple shot types which can be powered up, and there are also options and bombs available which contribute to Moon Diver's extensive arsenal.</desc>
	<path>./Darius II (Japan).gen</path>
	<desc>Long time ago, the planet of Darius went into ruin but Proco and Tiat of Darius gave birth to a new planet and named it Orga. After the passing of many centuries, Proco Jr. and Tiat Young receive a strange radio broadcast from the galaxy. They discover the radio broadcast is a mayday signal from another descendent of Darius. They board the Silverhawk, preparing to defeat an evil force and journey to the galaxy.

Darius II, or Sagaia as it is known in the West, is the second installment in Taito's premier shoot 'em up series. Its main distinguishing features are the non-linear level system and the enemies, which are different kinds of seafood.</desc>
	<path>./Darwin 4081 (Japan, Korea).gen</path>
	<desc>Lakya is a technologically-advanced civilization on a planet far from our own galaxy. The planet's inhabitants have unknowingly unleashed the planet's life force, Evol. As the Evol drifts from Lakya, it reaches a planet called Cokyo, whose inhabitants use it to attack and invade Lakya. Now, fighters from Lakya must fight back against the invading army by using the Evol themselves.

Darwin 4081 is a vertical scrolling shooter based on the 1987 Data East coin-op Super Real Darwin. The main attraction of the game is the ability to evolve your ship into a wide variety of different forms, each with their own attack abilities, by collecting DNA dropped by enemies. Other powerups will increase you ship's speed, give you an option that follows your ship, or even increase the power of your smart bombs. The game features surreal futuristic art design fitting of its title.</desc>
	<path>./David Robinson Basketball (Japan).gen</path>
	<desc>David Robinson's Supreme Court is a basketball game with both exhibition and tournament modes. Choose one out of four fictional teams and then draft various skilled fictional players onto the team. Exhibition mode lets the player choose to either player 3 on 3 or 5 on 5 while tournament mode only allows for 5 on 5 play. The game also features a roleplaying  mode where the player takes the role of and controls only one player on the court.

Tournament mode lets the players team play the three other teams with the prize being a chance to go up against David Robinson's All-Stars. Speaking of which, David Robinson offers commentary at the halftime of games.

The game features three levels of difficulty (beginner, normal, and superstar), and also adjustable minutes per quarter (from three to twelve).</desc>

	<path>./Doki Doki Penguin Land MD (Japan).gen</path>
	<desc>Doki Doki Penguin Land MD is a 16-bit remake of the classic Master System puzzle game Penguin Land. The player controls a penguin who must get an egg from the top of each stage to the bottom, where his girlfriend is waiting for him. The player must break ice blocks to open a path, but if the egg falls too far, it will break. There are numerous hazards that the player must watch out for, including moving platforms, solid iron blocks, blocks that will break as soon as the egg touches them, moving spikes, and tubes through which only the penguin or the egg can pass.

The player can also find special items to help out; hearts will increase the bonus score, wings let the penguin jump higher, and iron eggs let the egg fall further without breaking. There are a total of 30 puzzles to solve, with a password given every five stages. The game also lets you pause the game to view the entire map, as well as set a waypoint to return to should the egg break.

	<desc>A dream thief has come and stolen the dreams of all the children, using them to create his own personal paradise where nobody may trespass. The children can't continue on without their dreams, and someone need to save them...that someone being Doraemon, the mechanical blue cat from the future! Finding his friends have lost their color, Doraemon flies into the sky and chases after the dream thief into his world of dreams.

	<path>./Double Dragon II - The Revenge (Japan).gen</path>
	<desc>The lovely Marian was rescued from the clutches of the Black Warriors gang by Billy &amp; Jimmy Lee in the first Double Dragon game, but now the gang has killed her in retaliation of their early defeat. The Dragons must now embark on a mission to avenge her death and defeat the Black Warriors for the second and final time.

The original arcade version of "Double Dragon II" was essentially an improved version of the first game. In addition to offering renewed audio and visuals, as well as new traps, moves and enemy characters, "Double Dragon II" discarded the conventional punch and kick buttons in favor of a direction-oriented attacking system similar to the original Technos beat-em-up Renegade.

The NES version offered new stages, new moves and illustrated cut-scenes, as well as a new final boss and a new ending. Unlike the first NES game, it offered 2-Player Co-Op gameplay with the option to turn off the friendly fire.

The Game Boy version of "Double Dragon II" is an English localization of a "Kunio-kun" game (the Japanese franchise which inspired "Renegade" and "River City Ransom" and has nothing to do with the arcade and NES versions.
</desc>
	<path>./Dragon Ball Z - Buyuu Retsuden (Japan).gen</path>
	<desc>Dragon Ball Z: L'Appel Du Destin is a fighting game that maintains the dual screen mode previously seen in the DBZ Super Butouden series of the SNES, which allowed you to be far from the opponent yet still be able to see him by having the screen split between the two characters. This is important to note, as the most damaging attack of the game could be just executed from far away of your opponent, the energy fireball projectiles. These special attacks also need that you have your KI bar (which unlike energy one, is rechargeable) to a considerable level and the only way to block them is by means of a long button combination.

The constitution of the characters is based strictly on the Freezer and Cell sagas (Son Goku SSJ, Son Gohan SSJ2, Piccolo, Vegeta SSJ, Future Trunks SSJ, Krilin, Recoome, Ginyu, Freezer, A-18 and Perfect Cell), with special mention to Krilin, Ginyu and Recoome, who made here their first appearance in a fighting game. There are also 9 scenarios available, all of them corresponding to recognizable areas of the anime itself, some also appearing for 2 times but in different status (ie, "normal" Namek and Namek "in flames").

	<desc>Dyna Brothers is a Strategy game, published by CRI,  which was released in Japan in 1992.</desc>
	<path>./Dyna Brothers 2 (Japan).gen</path>
	<desc>Planet Jura is a green and beautiful place where dinosaurs have lived for longer than anyone can remember. One day, however, a giant black ship appears in the sky, and aliens come down to the surface and start attacking the dinosaurs. Feeling their suffering, the dinosaurs' creator, The Egg, awakens. To protect their race and their planet, the dinosaurs must fight the invading aliens, and force them to leave Planet Jura.

Dyna Brothers 2 is a real-time strategy game comparable to Populous. The player controls their small army of dinosaurs against the invading enemy alien army. There are six types of units, each of which has different skills and proficiencies. The player can order their dinosaurs to move or attack, and can also hatch new dinosaurs from The Egg. There are also environmental commands like earthquakes and lightning strikes.

The game features a practice mode, story mode, and free mode, as well as a 2-player versus mode where the second player takes the role of the alien invaders.</desc>
	<path>./Ecco the Dolphin (Japan).gen</path>
	<desc>Travel through time along with Ecco the dolphin, in the only game that could call itself a "dolphin simulator". Indeed, you can do pretty much everything a typical dolphin does, including eating fish, surfacing in order to breathe, using your biological sonar and of course, jumping out of the water to amaze your friends.

The storyline is actually deeper that one may think by looking at the box illustration. As Ecco, you are the only dolphin who managed to escape from a giant whirlpool which sucked down your entire pod. The five shining stars on your forehead show that you are the chosen one to save them. But that task will be not be an easy one, as you will have to travel through time and space with the Atlantean time machine, and meet the mystical Asterite in order to defeat the Vortex Queen.</desc>
	<path>./Ecco the Dolphin II (Japan).gen</path>
	<desc>The followup to Ecco the Dolphin, in which Ecco successfully destroyed the Vortex. Unfortunately, it turns out that the Vortex Queen followed it to the Earth and eventually destroyed the Asterite. All the world's oceans are threatened, and actually already doomed.

In order to restore the Asterite and finally defeat the Vortex Queen, Ecco will have to confront once again the tides of time, which have split into two possible futures, the regular one and the dark one dominated by the Vortex Queen.

Ecco: The Tides of Time features even better graphics than its predecessor, and introduces a new gameplay mode in which the camera follows the dolphin from behind instead of from the side.

	<path>./Eliminate Down (Japan).gen</path>
	<desc>Eliminate Down is a horizontally-scrolling shooter similar in style to Thunder Force. The player has several weapons that can be freely switched (forward shot, back shot, and missile), and can also change the speed of the ship. Enemies come from all directions, and certain waves will drop powerups, including shields and weapon upgrades. The player needs to collect five upgrades in order to improve their weaponry, but the upgrade affects all three weapons.

The game includes eight stages, most of which include both a midboss and a boss at the end, and three difficulty settings. There is also a minigame similar to Whack-a-Mole where there is a grid of ship icons, and the player must hit the rotating ships.</desc>
	<path>./Europa Sensen (Japan).gen</path>
	<desc>The game is an historical simulation of the European and North African theaters of World War II. The game allows up to two players to role-play as Army commanders for either the Axis or Allied forces. This game emphasizes the military aspects of the war and leaves diplomacy to the politicians.
</desc>
	<path>./Ex-Ranza (Japan).gen</path>
	<desc>Ranger X was released fairly late in the lifetime of the megadrive. Coming from an unknown developer it was released with little fanfare and advertising but has become one of the best demonstrations of what the genesis/megadrive is capable of.

The game is a side scrolling shooter of sorts. You control a large mech (robot) which has a smaller side-kick mech which is a bit like a car. The two can join together providing an alternate shooting mode. Whilst controlling just the main mech however, the player can shoot both forward and back by using different buttons. The mech can also use it's rocket pack to boost off of the ground and hover for a short while. Levels are not necessarily left to right moving (although for the most part they are) and the game is an interesting blend of platform game and shoot-em-up.

The game features innovative graphics given the hardware limitations - there is a 3D introduction to most levels (remembering that the console had no 3D capability and a tile-based renderer) and some levels use a line-based scrolling effect to give the impression of 3D backgrounds.</desc>
	<path>./F1 Circus MD (Japan).gen</path>
	<desc>F1 Circus '91 is a Formula 1 simulation racing game. The series did not yet feature an official license, and so just like the first game it only features generic team and driver names. The game itself plays much the same, with the overhead race view and focus on car tuning and damage. The World Championship mode has of course returned, though the managerial Constructors mode is no longer present. There is also a Free Attack mode, where any course can be freely practiced; a Training mode, where special training courses can be raced on to learn the ins and outs of the game; and a Watch mode, where the player can choose a course and watch a demonstration race.
</desc>
	<path>./F1 Hero MD (Japan).gen</path>
	<desc>Following F1 Grand Prix Nakajima Satoru, Varie produced another racing simulation using the license. This time the racing is from a first person view aping Super Monaco Grand Prix. The car setup can be modified before you take to the track

There is a Time Attack mode, allowing you to go for as fast a laptime as possible on any of the game's 20 circuits (which include the 16 tracks of the 1992 Formula 1 season), as well as a full season mode, with qualifying and the race itself. Weather can be customised in the Time Attack mode but is randomly chosen in Grand Prix mode, while you can only choose one of the D-tier teams (the 4 weakest of the 16) in grand Prix mode, but can drive for McLaren, Williams et al in Time Attack.</desc>
	<path>./Fastest 1 (Japan).gen</path>
	<desc>Fastest 1 is a Formula One racing game. The game doesn't have an official FIA license, but much like Human's Fire Pro Wrestling series, includes a number of recognizable fictionalized drivers, such as Ayrton Sesna and Satoru Inakajima. The game includes a world championship mode, where the player must start from the lowest rankings and win races to become the F1 world champion. There is also a battle mode where one or two players can race each other or against computer opponents, as well as a test run mode where the player can learn each course and try to set course records. There are a total of 16 different courses, which can be played in either dry, wet, or half-wet conditions, as well as a wide variety of vehicle settings that can be tweaked.</desc>
	<path>./Fatman (Japan).gen</path>
	<desc>An eclectic, intriguing fighting game. Choose from different alien races (including Human) with different abilities and fighting styles, purchase weapons and devices, and fight your way through multiple opponents to face the Fatman.  Some of the more innovative features include being able to place wagers on the outcome of the fight, and the phenominon of a special move being less powerful the more you use it to balance gameplay.

2 player, head-to-head combat is supported.</desc>
	<path>./Final Blow (Japan).gen</path>
	<desc>Final Blow is an action game based around the sport of boxing. You can play the fighters in a sequence of knock-out competitions, (the computer versions also include a round-robin league). Rounds last one minute, with a short break in between them. As in the real sport, your aim is to knock your opponent down for 10 seconds, by gradually weakening him with a series of punches. You can block punches, to avoid them inflicting damage onto you. The ring is of a limited size, so players can be cornered, although the referee will intervene to break the boxers up if they become entangled in a stalemate position.

The genesis version is not to be confused with the Master System game of the same name, which is entirely different.</desc>
	<path>./Fire Mustang (Japan).gen</path>
	<desc>Fire Mustang is a fast side-scrolling shooter set during World War II. The player controls a P-51D Mustang plane through different missions, with many enemies on the screen at the same time and a large aircraft as a boss at the end of every mission. The Mustang has an unlimited amount of bullets, but one hit is sufficient to lose a life. There are different power-ups to collect, providing additional fire power and new firing patterns. Regardless of the power-ups, the Mustang shoots forward and drops bombs to the ground at the same time, targeting ground troops. There is a limited amount of forgers, large blasts damaging many enemies at once.</desc>
	<path>./Fire Pro Wrestling Gaiden (J) [c][!].gen</path>
	<desc>Thunder Pro Wrestling Retsuden is a spinoff of Human's popular Fire Pro Wrestling series, and the only title in the series to appear on the Mega Drive. Like the other Fire Pro games, it is an arcade-style wrestling game featuring a roster of fictional wrestlers. The game includes a standard World Championship mode where the player picks a wrestler and fights his way to win the title. There is also an "Exciting" mode in which one or two players can play an exhibition singles or tag match against the computer or each other, an Elimination mode where each player picks a team of five wrestlers, and a "Handicap" mode where one fighter must alone take on a tag team.
</desc>
	<path>./Flintstone (Japan).gen</path>
	<desc>This is a platform game based on the famous Flintstones series. The game features many original Flintstones characters, such as Fred, Wilma, Barney, and others. Instead of the usual "save the princess" or "liberate the world" kinds of a plot, "The Flintstones" is mainly based on small quests: Fred has to retrieve a lost item, etc. The large levels are divided into smaller stages. In the end of each level there is a boss battle. The gameplay involves mostly jumping and hitting the enemies on the heads with a club. The health is measured by hearts. During the game Fred will find many useful items, including some that will increase his health level.</desc>
	<path>./Fushigi no Umi no Nadia (Japan).gen</path>
	<desc>This is one of the several games based on the animé series The Secret of Blue Water. The series (and the game) are loosely based on the stories by the famous French science fiction author Jules Verne. The game is set in 1889, a time of great inventions and technology progress unseen before. You play as Jean, a young genius scientist. In Paris he meets Nadia, an African circus performer. Nadia wears a pendant that contains magical powers, and that is why the evil Gargoyle is after her - this pendant is just the item she needs to build the ultimate weapon, the Tower of Babel. Jean will do anything to protect Nadia, and hope that his love to her, his adventurer spirit, and the power of science will eventually defeat Gargoyle!

Unlike most Japanese adventures, "Fushigi no Umi no Nadia" is a top-down, third-person perspective game, in which you actually move your character around. Nadia and other friends join Jean in a RPG-like fashion (although there is no combat in the game, different characters have their own item-based abilities you should use at certain points). There are no real puzzles in the game, but you'll often have to use your inventory items to make the game progress.

Not to confuse with other Fushigi no Umi no Nadia games (for NES, Turbo CD, etc.)!</desc>

Along the way Lucia will have to shoot down dozens of enemies in standard shooter fashion, while avoiding destruction and collecting power-ups that extend her ship's energy, upgrade weapons and gather screen-clearing bombs.

The Gleylancer comes equipped with two hovering satellites that can receive weapon upgrades of their own, and can lock their positions at specific angles to increase your firepower and protect the player from enemy attacks. Features only a single-player campaign with two different endings depending on how the final stages are completed (e.g. if Lucia's father is rescued or not).

	<desc>In an era of frequent alien attacks, the Earth has a unified Government, which relies on a line of cyborgs known as the Heavy Dolls for defense. The greatest of these are known as the Heavy Nova, a title earned by passing a rigorous training regime.

You are taking on the simulated proving grounds, which are split into two styles of alternating action. In the first you must progress (initially purely horizontally, though later with vertical flick-scrolling as well) through a hostile environment of enemies, bombs and traps, gaining points for doing it quickly and with lots of energy left. Initially you can fly and kick as needed.

Once this section is complete, you move on to one-on-one combat of the Street Fighter 2 style. The early foes have far less energy than you begin with. As you progress through the game, you are awarded extra attacking moves, in a manner similar to Brutal: Paws of Fury</desc>

	<desc>Danpei Ichigeki is a young boy who loves dodgeball. Danpei's father was a famous dodgeball player when he was still alive, and he joins the Dodgeball Club at his elementary school. However, these kids are very serious about their dodgeball, and the road ahead isn't going to be easy for Danpei.

Dodge Danpei is a team dodgeball game, one of several based on the anime and manga created by Tetsuhiro Koshita, which plays strikingly similar to the well-known Super Dodge Ball. Each team has four main players and three support players, and attempts to knock out the opposing team's main members by throwing the ball at them in various ways. Apart from normal throws, the player can also pass to teammates, and execute special power throws which are harder to dodge or catch.

The game includes several different game modes, including the main story mode which follows the story of the anime, as well as one- and two-player exhibition matches. There is also a "league" mode which allows for a tournament of up to six teams, as well as a training mode where the game teaches the basics of how to play the game.</desc>
	<path>./Hybrid Front, The (Japan).gen</path>
	<desc>The Hybrid Front is a turn-based strategy video game, released in Japan (exclusively) for the Mega Drive.

The introduction begins with someone logging into a computer. Then, it shows a revolution that occurred sometime in the 2080s leading into a series of wars and conflict that lead up to the video game's main setting of the 26th century. Since the second half of the 21st century, the depletion of fossil fuel resources have helped to deepen the conflict on Earth...
During the 24th century, the Earth was bombarded from orbit with massive optical weapons called the Metal Hammer by an Italian consortium; major cities around the world were burned to toast. The resistance would eventually be put down by CoCoON (abbreviation for COoperation COmmunity of Orbital Negotiation). Not only they would gain the corporate hegemony of humanity, CoCoON would develop a reputation as a hostile group of corporate war hawks; constantly revolting against the peaceful coalition of the PETO (abbreviation for Pan Earth Treaty Organization).

Four characters from the show all decide they want to be the island's president, and so they set off to start campaigning.

The goal of each round is to collect the most points; points can be earned or lost based on the spaces the player lands on. The round ends when a player reaches the destination set at the start of the round, which gives a points bonus. The player with the most points after a set number of rounds is the winner.

	<desc>In the future, even the simple kids game of marbles is high-tech and extreme. Hyper Marbles takes the basic concept of the classic kids game -- to knock the opponent's marbles out of the playfield -- and gives it a futuristic sci-fi twist. The player directs their robotic marble around the field, attempting to push their opponents into the deadly electrified walls lining the arena. Aiding in this is a jet booster, which can cause opponents to bounce quite far, but if overused will overheat and must cool down before being used again. There are ten different arenas, each with different hazards like oil slicks and moving barriers. There is a single player mode, where the goal is to destroy all enemies to move on, as well as a two-player versus mode where the goal is to destroy the other player.</desc>

	<desc>European Club Soccer has dozens of teams from all across Europe (around 170), and each country is represented by at least two teams. In addition to correct club names, it also has recognizable imitations of team badges and kits; although more elaborate kits (such as those worn by Juventus, FC Porto or Celtic F.C.) are simplified (Juventus have a silver shirt, Porto blue and Celtic green). Player names, on the other hand, were made by mixing names found on real squads. Portuguese teams, for instance, had a large number of Yugoslavian players in the early 1990s, and that was reflected by players with names such as Valentim Ivic (of Valentim Loureiro and Tomislav Ivic, then Boavista FC chairman and S.L. Benfica manager, respectively). Names could not be changed, and since the game lacked a battery, it does not store changes done to kits and passwords were used to resume tournaments (example of a password sheet). Rotherham United are included amongst the English clubs despite never playing in the top tier of English football, this is due to the developer, Krisalis Software, being based in Rotherham. All other clubs have played in their own country's top tier.</desc>

	<desc>A daughter of the chair of a local high school, Yu Honjo, has been kidnapped by someone unknown. Unable to go to the police, the girl's sister, Mai, hires a private investigator to find out what happened to her. The only piece of evidence is a photograph from the night of Yu's disappearance, where the missing girl and three other students from the same school are playing a game of mahjong.

Jantei Monogatari is a hybrid of a traditional-style Japanese adventure game and a regular mahjong game. The player takes the role of the unnamed private investigator, and moves from place to place via menus, talking to different characters. The investigation happens through playing mahjong with each suspect: win and they'll tell you a bit more of what they know. At first, the investigator can only speak with the three girls in the photo, but as he wins games of mahjong against them, he gains information and experience that allow him to find new clues and talk to more suspects. The investigator will need to play against a dozen different opponents in his attempt to find out what happened to the kidnapped girl.</desc>

For the entertainment of the futuristic masses, you play a criminal that has been inserted into a mechanical body with the promise that if you succeed in surviving through all the levels (there are many and they are hard), you will be set free.
You start each level at the bottom, near pooling liquid which will soon rise, at your immediate peril. Navigate the level from bottom to the exit at the top before the liquid rises and kills you. There are many other foes that fly around, causing you damage and basically annoying you to spit.
Most levels must be navigated through a series of keyed gates, doors, or portals. These shaped keys are scattered around the map and must by picked up and used only on the gates they match individually.
Twist: You can only carry one special weapon (triple shot, laser beam, or vertical shot) and one tool (key, liquid-freeze, or a red herring) at a time.
This game requires a lot of memorization of enemy movement patterns and optimum routes.
A unique feature is that when you die, you can watch a replay and take over at any point to continue your game.
You can also hit the HELP button at the start of each level to view a map, helping you plan your route.</desc>

Every woman born into the Mano family has taken up the role of the legendary Devil Hunters, warriors who battle demons and other forces of darkness who threaten Earth. The realm of the demons (which is parallel to our world) is in cross-dimensional alignment with our own, which could cause a portal to open, allowing the demons to cross over, and launch an all-out attack.

	<path>./Megapanel (Japan).gen</path>
	<desc>Megapanel is a tile-based puzzle game that plays like a mixture of Tetris Attack and a traditional sliding tile puzzle. Blocks rise from the bottom of a well, and the player must slide them around in order to create a row or column of three same-color blocks. This causes the group to clear, and potentially create chains from the blocks above falling. As the game continues, the number of blocks that must be cleared to continue as well as the speed at which the stack rises will both increase.

The game includes three modes. First is training mode which explains the basics of the game. In this mode, a certain number of blocks must be cleared to complete the stage. Second is a "pin-up" mode for one player, where clearing blocks reveals parts of an image of a cute anime girl, the goal being to uncover the entire picture. Last is a two-player versus mode, where players compete to clear their blocks the fastest, and can send garbage blocks to their opponent and fill up their field. The game includes two difficulty settings, two versus modes, a sound test, and a unique mode that displays the entire game in sepia tone.</desc>

	<path>./Metal Fangs (Japan).gen</path>
	<desc>Metal Fangs is a unique futuristic battle driving game, where the player controls a team of racers and must attempt to destroy the competing team. Each "race" is made up of two heats of two parts each, and hits or kills on the other team earns points. During each heat, each team takes one turn attacking (four vehicles on the course) and one turn defending (three vehicles on the course). The team with the most points at the end of the last heat wins a reward and moves on to the next match.

However, your team won't get very far with just its basic equipment. After choosing your team's colors and members, you must then purchase upgrades for each person: engines, fuel, AI, armor, and of course weapons. During the game, you can switch freely between each member of your team. Your vehicle automatically moves forward around the track, but you can turn, throttle, and brake in order to move closer to or escape from the other team.

After each successful match there is a game of chance where winnings can be increased. There is also a two-player simultaneous battle mode.</desc>

His girlfriend Traysia gives him a pendant, to remind him of her... will Roy be able to escape from all the dangers that await him on his long journey and to see Traysia again?

The game is a party-based RPG with randomly encountered enemies. The combat is somewhat similar to early Ultima games. When an enemy appears, you enter a battle screen on which your party is positioned in the lower part, the enemies in the upper part. You can attack if you are close enough to the enemy, otherwise you'll just move towards him. Magic spells should be cast to an appropriate direction to hurt the enemy.</desc>
	<path>./Monster World IV (Japan).gen</path>
	<desc>This is a sequel to Wonder Boy 5: Monster World 3. You control Asha, the green-haired girlfriend of Shion, the hero of the previous game. One day, Asha was standing on a cliff near her home village, and suddenly heard a mysterious voice calling for help. She decided to leave the village and to embark on an adventure to discover the identity of this mysterious person.

Monster World 4 is essentially a platform game, with slight RPG/adventure elements (puzzles, treasure, equipment, etc.) Asha can jump, run, attack or defend (by pressing the "down" button). She can also use items and equip weapons and armor, talk to people, and open treasure chests. Later in the game, she will also be able to use magic, and a little blue pet animal will assist and help her on her journey. The combat system is very similar to the classical Zelda style. Health and mana points are measured in little hearts, and the more you progress in the game, the more hit points you gain.

The game was released only in Japan. It is sometimes erroneously called "Wonder Boy 6".</desc>

	<path>./Mutant League Football (Japan).gen</path>
	<desc>Futuristic, intergalactic war disguised as American Football, Mutant League Football was one of the most unique football games ever to hit the gaming market. It's a unique blend of sports and sci-fi, and the actual football is the good ol' smash-mouth kind, literally.

Dynamite throwing running backs, blitzing trolls, robots that bleed oil, it's all here. Opposing quarterback connecting on too many passes? Blitz him 'til he's dead. Suspect the ref's been bribed by the other side? Call a Kill Ref audible; it's a 5 yard penalty though. 

Take your pick from nineteen teams, including three All-Star teams. There are five difficulty levels and a slow/fast game speed toggle. A tournament mode awaits those who want something more than a quick game versus the computer or a friend.

There are nineteen different fields to play on, all with there own special quirks. The Hellfield is littered with mines and fire pits to put an end to a careless runner, while The Pen is a slippery sheet of ice.</desc>

	<desc>One day, a kiwi tribe was having fun and games outside the zoo, only to be kidnapped by the evil-minded Leopard Seal, who plans to sell them at the black market. Fortunately, during the kidnapping process, Tiki, leader of the tribe, managed to escape the sack, and her job is to rescue Phee-Phee and the other kiwis scattered around New Zealand, and are held in cages in various locations that include Auckland, Rotorua, Waitomo Caves, Strait Cook, and Mt. Cook. 

If Tiki doesn't rescue a kiwi in a limited amount of time, the devil will appear and try to kill her. When Tiki reaches the outskirts of each city, except Strait Cook, there is a boss waiting to meet Tiki, and kill her by using their own choice of weapons. Also making the rescue mission difficult are several nasties that attempt to throw their own weapons, like bombs and arrows, at her. To defeat these enemies, Tiki shoots at them using her crossbow and arrows. More often than not, when Tiki shoots at enemies, they will leave behind pieces of fruit that she can pick up for points. However, it is likely that Tiki may get other weapons or the letters E, X, T, E, N, and D. Collecting all these letters will result in an extra life, and as for the weapons, they include laser shots, bombs, and fireballs. 

In some levels, a few areas are located further up than just left or right, and the only way that Tiki can go up is by snatching something off the enemy that gives her the ability to fly up. Other areas are underwater, and when Tiki goes underwater, her oxygen meter decreases, so she has to rise up to the surface again to restore her oxygen levels. Apart from her own weapons, Tiki is able to squirt water at enemies if she gets to the top of the water.</desc>

	<path>./Ninja Burai Densetsu (Japan).gen</path>
	<desc>Ninja Burai Densetsu  is a 1991 strategy game by Sega for the Sega Mega Drive released exclusively in Japan.

The game plays similarly to other strategy games such as SystemSoft's Daisenryaku games and Sega's own Shining games. You are in control of a team of ninjas fighting another team. C selects a ninja/confirms an action. B cancels an action, or if no action is in progress, selects the next ninja. A opens the battle menu, which allows you to end your turn. Battles are fully automatic.

Osomatsu-kun: Hachamecha Gekijo (Nonsense Theater) is a side-scrolling action platformer based on the manga and anime created by Fujio Akatsuka, which plays similarly to Alex Kidd. The player controls the titular Osomatsu through outlandishly Japanese environments, fighting bizarre enemies, collecting ribbons to buy various items from hidden shops, and searching for his missing brothers. Each stage is made up of multiple areas; falling into holes in the ground leads to underground passages, and jumping onto flying shells leads up into the clouds.

Fortune tells that very soon, the person who will stop the evils of this pachinko parlor will appear, and Chen's daughter, Ren, sets out on her 18th birthday for Yokohama, looking for her father.

Pachinko Kuunyan is a pachinko RPG much like the Pachio-kun series. The player controls Ren as in a standard role-playing game, but rather than fighting battles, she can enter pachinko halls and play the machines. Each of the five cities has several pachinko halls, and Ren must empty out a certain number of machines before she can move on to the next city.

The game plays like a standard 2D fighter: you can punch, kick, and jump on you opponents, but the fights are not entirely 2D, since you can also take a few steps vertically.</desc>

This fighting game is a coin-op conversion of the Neo-Geo hit of the same name, and has all characters, stages, and moves featured in the arcade unit. Unlike the original arcade version, players can now play as Mr. Big and the elusive Mr. Karate.

The gameplay differs from most fighting games. In this game, you have a Spirit meter. A Spirit meter is in the game and will decrease as you perform special moves. It can be recharged, but doing so leaves you open to attack. When your health is almost gone, you can perform a secret combination that will unleash a deadly attack on your opponent - provided you have a full Spirit meter.</desc>

	<desc>Fire Shark takes place around a small island in the South Pacific.  It is a continuously-scrolling aerial shooter with a top-down view.  Your World War II era biplane has been modified to shoot lasers and drop powerful bombs. 

There are ten levels in the game in which you will face aerial, aquatic, and ground enemies. They all fire scores of missiles at you in an attempt to knock you from the sky. 

In between levels, your plane will land on a runway for refueling and maintenance. You will receive bonus points for the number of bombs left in your hold and the number of lightning bolt icons you picked up in the prior level.

There are also many power-ups available in each level. Slow-moving blimps contain a power-up icon which is revealed after the zeppelin explodes. Other icons appear when various other enemies or buildings are destroyed. These power-ups will float around the screen for several seconds. Grabbing them with your plane earns you a weapon upgrade or bonus points.

The standard weapons are the bomb and the Wide Shot. As power-ups are obtained the number of shots per blast can increase up to 16. The Wide Shot is a comparatively weak weapon that usually requires multiple hits to take an enemy down.

The Shark Beam is a green laser that fires in a spiral pattern and the strongest weapon of all is the Super Fire. It will fire continuously while the fire button is held. Power-ups increase its beam count to 4.</desc>

	<desc>Shikinjoh or Shi Kin Joh or Shi-Kin-Joh or Shikinjou (or likewise)  is a 1989/1990 puzzle game by Scap Trust for the NEC PC-88 and NEC PC-98. Sunsoft ported it to the Sega Mega Drive and Sega Game Gear in 1991, with the Mega Drive version having added Sega Mega Modem capabilities. No version has left Japan. A version was later included with Sunsoft's Game no Tetsujin The Shanghai for the Sega Saturn.

The goal of the game is to force your way to the exit by pushing mahjong tiles around. When two tiles with the same image meet, they disappear. Some tiles cannot be moved. You can only push tiles forward in the direction you are facing. C/2 goes back one move. A/1 opens a menu with various options. The Mega Drive version has several gameplay modes; the Game Gear version only has standard levels and a password system.</desc>
	<path>./Shining and the Darkness (Japan).gen</path>
	<desc>This is a story-driven console-style RPG, and is the first in the three game Shining series for the Genesis (followed by Shining Force and Shining Force 2). The Kingdom of Thornwood has been invaded by Dark Sol's men, and it is your job to vanquish them. You will need the Arms of Light to do this.

The game is a first person RPG, with turn-based combat and cartoony graphics. The dialogue is displayed via dialog bubbles appearing above the characters speaking, although the protagonist never speaks. There are no sub-quests - the secrets in the game involve the location and use of special metal for forging esoteric items. There are about 25 to 30 hours of gameplay to be found here, before the final battle and ending sequence.</desc>

	<desc>Humans on Earth have lost their righteous ways. After seeing that this has happened, the Gods have decided to abandon the Earthlings and no longer protect them. Ashura, the King of an alien race hailing from the Evil World, decides that this is the perfect time to strike the vulnerable unprotected Earth.  It just so happens that one of the good gods, Hyperion, takes pity on the humans and decides to bestow his power to four of the strongest Earth warriors so they can go and defeat Ashura and his minions.

The player takes control of these four warriors who are Leo, a fencer, Marco, a monk, and Horatio and Tiffany, whom are both ninjas (one male, one female). Each character fires their own type of weapon and each character can charge up their weapon to make it a more powerful shot. All the characters also have a special weapon that can clear all the enemies on the screen but with the caveat that it can only be used once per stage. Each character also has a jump and speed attribute which when powered up allows them to jump higher and walk faster. Players can switch between all of the characters during a stage.

The game has 9 different stages. The player can play the first six (mountain,harbor,street,future,glen, and forest) in any order. Each round ends with a boss which must be defeated to clear that round.</desc>

She happens to be the granddaughter of the head of the dojo, and doesn't want him to get involved with the place, but Tsukumo insists on continuing regardless. He walks right in, and takes on the first guy in a karate gi he comes across...

Shura no Mon is a so-called "command action" game based on the manga by Masatoshi Kawahara. The player controls Tsukumo by selecting commands from a list, using different attacks and defensive maneuvers at the appropriate time, with the results shown via brief animated sequences. Between bouts, lightly-animated visual scenes progress the story. The plot closely follows the first arc from the manga, starting with Tsukumo's arrival at the legendary Jinmukan dojo.</desc>

While at first not knowing the difference between a slam dunk and a Sherman tank, he slowly becomes an important part of the Shohoku High School team, which fights against the odds on the road towards the regional championships.

Slam Dunk: Kyogo Makko Taiketsu! (Champion Front Showdown!) is a five-on-five basketball game based on the anime and manga created by Takehiko Inoue. Following the story, starting from the first exhibition matches, the player can take control of either a single player or the whole Shohoku team in an arcade-style basketball game. The game uses a side-view for the center court, and zooms in for a head-on view when near the basket. There is also an exhibition mode for up to five players, where six different school teams from the series are available for play.

However, also included on the cartridge is a completely new sequel with all-new stages, bosses, graphics, and music. The basic gameplay is identical: a vertically-scrolling shooter where power-ups cycle through a list to choose from, and it is possible to construct massively-wide ships with incredible firepower. Slap Fight MD also adds the ability to jettison your ship's power-ups causing a massive screen-filling explosion that can potentially save your life.</desc>

Now Nick and Tom find themselves with abilities dealing with snow and ice. These two Snow Brothers will need to hunt down the evil King Scorch and rescue the princesses.

Snow Bros. is a fixed-screen platform game where players must defeat all enemies on each level (screen), 50 altogether. The Snow Bros use snow as their weapon, throwing it at the enemies to stun them. When lots of snow is thrown at an enemy, it becomes covered in a flurry and unable to move. These can be rolled into giant snowballs and pushed or kicked into other enemies. If left alone, enemies will eventually defrost and become angry at the player. The enemy filled snowballs are a much stronger weapon then the regular handful of snow and are the only effective weapon Nick and Tom have against the bosses.</desc>

	<desc>Shove It! The Warehouse Game is a top-down puzzle game based on the original gameplay of Soko-Ban Hiroyuki Imabayashi wrote for Thinking Rabbit. The player controls Stevedore, a warehouse keeper, from a top-down view. As shown on the title screen, shoving boxes will earn him money to make his dreams come true, a lovely girlfriend and a fiery red sports car.

The game consists of 16 stages with 10 rounds each. At a certain stage, any of the 10 rounds can be selected while playing but a new stage will only be opened up when all rounds have been successfully completed. To complete a round, Stevedore needs to push all boxes on the designated spots. This will turn them into a different colour. This is no easy task as the level design will obstruct many moves and cornered boxes can no longer be moved. While playing it is possible to restart the round, undo the last step and the game keeps track of the number of steps taken.

The game supports passwords and includes an edit mode where new levels can be designed and played.</desc>

	<path>./Sonic Eraser (Japan).gen</path>
	<desc>Sonic Eraser is a puzzle game very similar to Columns that features Sega mascot Sonic the Hedgehog. Pieces in different arrangements drop into a well; if two or more matching pieces touch, they disappear and the above pieces fall to take their place. There are four different single-player game modes:

1. Round: Each stage starts with pieces in the well already. There are several spinning green pieces, which must all be destroyed to finish the stage.

2. Normal: A standard endless mode in which the game speed continually rises as matches are made.

3. Doubt: No white-colored blocks will appear in the drop formations, but often a random block in the formation will change to a white block after it is placed.

4. Block: Similar to Normal mode, but blocks will not fall out of formation until a match is made, allowing for impressive clear combos.

These modes can be played either single player or two-player simultaneous on separate fields. There is also a versus mode for one or two players, in which creating a combo of three or more clears will attack the opposing player, which causes them to lose control of their pieces for a short time.</desc>

</desc>
	<path>./Sonic the Hedgehog (Japan).gen</path>
	<desc>Sonic the Hedgehog is the first of many games starring Sega's premier rodent, Sonic. It's a side scrolling platform game with a difference: speed. Sonic rushes through levels with incredible speed, allowing him to traverse loops and jumps with ease. 

The plot of the game is simple. The evil Dr. Robotnik has captured many of Sonic's animal friends, and trapped them inside robots. Fortunately, Sonic can free his friends by destroying the robots with his spin attack. Meanwhile, Dr. Robotnik is trying to control the all-powerful chaos emeralds. Sonic must grab them before he does in the 3D rotating bonus levels. 

Sonic's weapon is his spin attack; while jumping, Sonic destroys hostile robots by touch. Throughout the platforming levels, Sonic collects numerous rings. If Sonic is hit by an enemy, all the rings he's carrying fall out and scatter around; Sonic can quickly grab the rings back before they disappear. If Sonic is hit while not carrying any rings, he dies. Collecting 100 rings gives Sonic an extra life. There is also an invincibility bonus which temporarily protects Sonic from all attacks. 

The game is divided into several "zones", each of them containing three levels. At the end of each zone Sonic confronts Dr. Robotnik in a boss fight. 

Sonic the Hedgehog is a significant game because it gave Sega it's first real mascot, and established the Genesis as the video game system with "attitude."</desc>
	<path>./Sonic the Hedgehog 3 (Japan).gen</path>
	<desc>Dr. Robotnik's Death Egg has crash-landed on Floating Island, so called because it harnesses the power of the Chaos Emeralds to float in the air.  Robotnik needs them to repair the Death Egg, so he tells the guardian of Floating Island, Knuckles the Echidna, that Sonic and Tails are there to steal them. With Knuckles tricked and trying to stop the heroes at every turn, will they be able to stop Robotnik in time?

Sonic the Hedgehog 3 is the third in the Sonic series of games. As with the previous games, it is a side-scrolling platformer based around speed. The basic game remains the same - players collect rings to earn extra lives, which are also used for protection, and scatter everywhere when Sonic is hurt. Sonic can jump on enemies to defeat them, and Spin Dash by holding down and the jump button, then letting go of down.

New to Sonic 3 are three different types of shields - the Fire Shield (which protects you from fire but disappears if you enter water), the Water Shield (which lets you breathe underwater infinitely) and the Electric Shield (which pulls nearby rings towards you). Sonic can use extra abilities when he has these shields by pressing jump while in the air - either a horizontal fireball dash, a vertical bubble bounce, or an electric double jump. If Sonic has no shield active, he can activate a brief energy shield, also by pressing jump in the air. Tails cannot use the shields' special abilities, but he can instead either fly or dog paddle (in water) for a limited time. He can also carry Sonic with him while doing so.

There are now two types of bonus stages - one is available by collecting 50 or more rings, running past a checkpoint lamppost and then jumping into the stars (as you could in Sonic the Hedgehog 2. This stage give you the chance to earn bonus rings, lives and power-ups. In this stage, there is a giant gumball machine. By hitting the crank, you'll spit out a bonus item that can either be rings, lives or bonus shields. The stage is over when you fall down the bottom of the screen.

The other, more important, Special Stage can be accessed by jumping into giant rings that are hidden away in secret areas in each level. In these stages, you must collect all the blue spheres while avoiding the red ones (which end the stage early). Collecting all of the outer blue spheres around square or rectangle sphere formations will turn them all into rings - if you collect 50 or more in this stage, you can earn a continue. Once you collect all the blue spheres in the stage, it clears and you earn one of the seven Chaos Emeralds.

Sonic 3 features six different Zones, which are made up of two Acts. At the end of each Act is a boss that must be defeated to complete the stage and rescue Sonic's animal friends that Robotnik has captured to turn into Badnik robots. The zones in Sonic 3 are approximately three times bigger than those in Sonic 2, and feature multiple, branching paths.

As with Sonic 2, there is a two-player Vs. Mode, which plays in a split-screen horizontal style. There are special monitor pick-ups in this mode which do things like swap player positions, lose rings, or cause a Badnik to appear. You can also race against the clock in a time trial mode.</desc>
	<path>./Sorcer Kingdom (Japan).gen</path>
	<desc>Sorcerer's Kingdom is a mix of RPG and strategy game. You play a young adventurer, who is sent out by the king to find out the reason for the increasing number of monsters that threaten the land and restore peace to the kingdom. Starting out as an Adventurer you are eventually given higher titles by the king, as a reward for completing quests. 

The game plays like a typical RPG but the battles are a little unusual. Whenever you are attacked or attack a monster that is within your current range, a turn-based battle starts immediately without taking you to a separate fighting area, and you have to fight all enemies that were visible the moment the battle started.</desc>
	<path>./Sorcerian (Japan).gen</path>
	<desc>Sorcerian is the fifth game in the Dragon Slayer series. It is set in the fantasy land known as Pentawa, whose inhabitants are in constant need of protection from ferocious creatures roaming the wilderness. The king of Pentawa hires a party of adventurers, and their first assignment is to retrieve a precious sceptre from a dungeon, where it is guarded by the evil demonic lord Ouks.

The game is an RPG with an unusual side-scrolling perspective and action-based combat, somewhat of a cross between Wizardry and platform games. Despite being a Japanese game, Sorcerian resembles Western RPGs of its time, focusing more on character development than story. In the beginning, the player creates a party of four characters, choosing between fighter, wizard, elf, and dwarf (races and classes are not distinguished). Beside the usual inns and shops, there are many things that can be done in the towns of the game, including complex development of magical spells (up to 120 spells of different disciplines), training to raise personal skills (strength, intelligence, etc.), enchanting weapons with elemental magic, as well as looking for part-time jobs.

The view switches to side-scrolling when the party ventures into a hostile area. Combat is performed in real time, with the player controlling the entire party at once. The lead character can be changed at any time, and battle actions will be carried out by whoever is in front. Melee attacks and magic spells are unleashed by pressing corresponding buttons. The characters can also jump and interact with objects by bumping into them. Dungeons are usually maze-like, and some contain simple puzzles such as finding and activating hidden switches to open doors.</desc>

The game is played on a large map made up of hexagonal spaces, each of which is a specific type of terrain. Each player controls a number of units, which each take up one space on the grid. Different units have different strengths and weaknesses toward other units, which are also affected by the terrain. Each player controls a capital, and the goal is to capture the other players' capitals.</desc>

Batters in the game are rated according to batting average, home runs, running speed, and fielding and throwing ability. Pitchers are rated by ERA, curve-throwing ability, stamina, top throwing speed, and the distance a hit pitch will travel. All the ratings make this game a challenge to your managerial ability as well as your gaming skill because you're calling the shots from the dugout.

In addition to a standard endless mode for one or two players, the game also includes a "time trial" mode for one or two players, where the goal is to get as many points as possible in three minutes. There is also a "doubles" mode, where two players work together to fill lines in an extra-wide well, each controlling their own pieces simultaneously.

The game offers a number of standard options: setting the starting level, how much "garbage" is at the bottom of the well when the game starts, and whether the next piece is visible. There are also optional "item blocks," which are special flashing pieces that give an extra bonus if they are used to clear a line.</desc>

	<path>./Time Dominator 1st (Japan).gen</path>
	<desc>A fast-paced platform game in the vein of the classic Sonic the Hedgehog. The evil overlord Time Dominator has constructed a time machine and is using it to steal treasures from the past, creating a warp in the flow of time. The Time Warp Patrol, created to prevent this sort of thing from happening, sends the special time-traveling duck Socket (or Minutes in the Japanese version) to fix the flow of time and stop Time Dominator.

Socket has reasonably basic abilities: he can jump, kick to the side or straight upward, and run quite fast. As Socket is a robot, his energy level continually drains from simply being in operation; thankfully, there are a liberal amount of electric bolts strewn about each stage, which will refill his health when picked up. Getting hit by enemies will take a chunk out of his life bar.

There are seven different themed zones, each with four separate parts. First up is the High Speed Zone, which is a gateway level leading to the next zone, and as the name suggests it encourages high speed play. Next is the Athletic Zone, which generally entails lots of jumping, and the Labyrinth Zone, which is focused on exploration and simply finding a path to the exit. At the end of each Labyrinth Zone, Socket faces off against Time Dominator in a boss round, then moves on to the next High Speed Zone.

The game also features a sound test mode and a time trial mode, where the High Speed Zone stages can be played without any enemies present with times being recorded.</desc>

Additionally, there are several power-ups that can be found, including speed-ups, additional mounted guns, and the life-up, which will not only increase the ship's armor, but also cause it to grow in size as well.

The game features 9 stages, each with a boss at the end, as well as one or two-player simultaneous play. The game difficulty has been rebalanced from the arcade to compensate for the lack of a trackball to control the aiming cursor; the player must stop their ship in order to move the cursor.

	<path>./V-Five (Japan).gen</path>
	<desc>This cartridge combines two different localized flavours of the original arcade game. There are two modes, Grind Stormer and V Five. Both offers the same levels and enemies, but have a different approach to how the player can use power-ups.

In this hectic, top-down, vertically-scrolling shooter where the screen is constantly filled with enemies and bullets, players have a constant, unlimited firing rate, enhanced by power-ups that include missiles, target-seeking bullets, shields, additional speed, extra power and bonus points. In Grind Stormer the ship always moves at a fast speed and the player can collect bombs that damage the entire screen and fend off bullets. The other variant V Five takes a Gradius-approach to power-ups, having the player advance through a selection of power-ups shown on the right by collecting tokens. In the first mode power-ups are immediately applied. In the second mode the ship is much slower and the player needs to decide to spend tokens on speed power-ups right away or save them to advance to seeking bullets or additional power.

The game difficulty, amount of lives and continues can be set in the options. After using a continue, the player immediately receives a "Special" power-up granting four wingmen.</desc>

You play a green-haired dude who must attack the invaders that attempt to collect weapons and use them to destroy the land. The game starts out like a simple platform game, but it's just when Wonder Boy enters the skull further on that the game is transformed into a shoot 'em up, so basically the gameplay consists of action and shooter scenes.

In the action scenes, your vitality decreases as you make your way towards the skull, but this can be restored by collecting fruit. A wide variety of weapons can be picked up, and not only does these allow you to use the weapons for a limited amount of time, but they also increase your vitality. 

In the shooter scenes, you ride your pink friend as you make your way through the scene. Here, your vitality remains static unless you are hit by an enemy passing by. As usual, there is a boss waiting for you at the end which you must defeat. Every boss changes color to show how much damage has been done to it. You have to defeat some bosses in two stages.

If your vitality gets low in each scene, you'll lose a life. You can also choose to have Wonder Girl join you, as two players can play the game.

She has only one weapon to dispose of enemies: thunder magic. This magic is auto-aiming and can track multiple targets. However, the game is quite hard as the levels are loaded with fantasy-inspired monsters. Using thunder magic reduces a magic gauge, meaning you often have to wait for it to recharge. Once fully charged Alisia can unleash a massive rolling blast of lightning across the screen.

During the game, you can improve your magic by picking up potions. There are also four monsters which accompany Alisia: Dragon Frye, Ball O'Fire, Thunder Raven and Boomerang Lizard. Each has different abilities, deciding which, if any, to use in a given situation is part of the challenge. These monsters, like Alisia herself, are fully upgradeable with power-ups. They can also die if weakened too much, forcing you to hunt for a reviving power-up. You can pause the game and select your companion at any time.</desc>

	<desc>Genki's first game is a paddle/pong game with a background story. Once upon a time there were a prince and a princess who loved each other. But the evil jealous demon named "Y" turn them both into stone paddles. Suddenly, a blue sphere fell from the sky, becoming the ball which the paddles can now push forwards, overcoming obstacles and defeating demons.

"Devilish" is different from other paddle games by letting you play with two paddles. The lower one behaves just like a usual paddle - you use it to prevent the ball from dropping down. The upper one can move and turn, allowing you to hit the ball from different angles and from different parts of the screen. You advance through levels by destroying bricks and enemies, going up until the level boss enemy appears.</desc>

	<desc>Le monde de Bahamut est divisé en huit puissants pays. Quatre d'entre eux sont gouvernés par des êtres humains ou des créatures humaines, tandis que les quatre autres sont sous le contrôle des forces démoniaques du mal. Ces pays font la guerre les uns aux autres, chacun essayant de dominer les autres. Votre tâche est de choisir l'un de ces pays et de le rendre le plus puissant de Bahamut, conquérir les autres et vaincre leurs seigneurs.

Dans les batailles, vous contrôlez plusieurs unités de soldats ou de créatures magiques que vous pouvez appeler pour vous aider.</desc>
	<path>./Bare Knuckle - Ikari no Tetsuken - Streets of Rage (World) (Rev A).md</path>
	<desc>Streets of Rage, Sega's answer to Final Fight, follows the story of three young police officers (Adam Hunter, Axel Stone and Blaze Fielding) in a city controlled by a criminal syndicate led by a "Mr. X" where crime is rampant, which leads the three heroes to make a pact to leave the force and topple the syndicate by themselves.

Gameplay is straightforward and simple. Three buttons are used, one to jump, other to attack and another to perform a range attack from a support police car. Each character has a limited set of moves that include punching and kicking or performing a back attack (if in the open), two grapple moves (depending if holding the opponent in front or by the back), a flying attack, and if playing with another player two additional tag attacks, and different abilities: Adam is slow, but a good jumper and a hard hitter, Axel fast and also a hard hitter, but a lousy jumper and Blaze fast and a good jumper, but weak hitter.
Levels are in typical arcade side-scroller fashion: move from left to right (with two exceptions), clearing screens from enemies one after another as fast as possible while avoid taking damage with a boss in the end. Some levels feature "death drops" where the player must avoid falling, while throwing enemies there at the same time, including a typical elevator level. Several items are scattered on the ground, from melee weapons and bonus points (and lives or additional police cars) to apples and turkeys (to restore health).</desc>
	<path>./Bare Knuckle II (Japan).md</path>
	<desc>After Axel Stone, Blaze Fielding and Adam Hunter destroyed the evil Syndicate leader, Mr. X, the city became a peaceful place to live, and each one of them followed their own paths. One year later, after their reunion, Adam's brother Sammy returned from school to find their apartment in a mess, and Adam nowhere to be seen, and after calling his two friends, one of them notices a photo of Adam chained to a wall, next to someone they knew very well - Mr. X, who returned to turn the peaceful city once again into a war zone. Now, Axel, Blaze, Sammy, and Axel's good friend Max, a pro wrestler, must head out to stop Mr. X once again...hopefully for good...

Streets of Rage 2 differs from the previous title in several ways. There are changes in both graphics (characters now are bigger, more detailed and with more animation frames, and scenarios are less grainy) and gameplay (the rocket move was replaced by a special move that doubles in offense and defense along several new moves), along other new features such as life bars (and names) for all enemies and the radically different new characters.</desc>
	<path>./Bare Knuckle III (Japan).md</path>
	<desc>In part three of the Streets of Rage series, Mr. X is back and this time his plan involves replacing public officials with his own robots. Only Axel, Blaze, Skate, and new-comer Dr. Zan can stop him. Streets of Rage 3 features all of the beat 'em up action you would expect from a Streets of Rage game. One new feature is the special move power bar, where it only costs energy to do a special move if the bar isn't full. Also new is the ability to do special maneuvers with different weapons, depending on the character. For example, Skate has no special move with the pipe, but does have one with the knife. The opposite is true for Axel. Any weapon Dr. Zan picks up is turned into energy balls which he can throw at the enemies. Secret characters and multiple endings add replay value.</desc>
	<path>./Batman (Japan).md</path>
	<desc>The Genesis version of Batman: The Video Game follows closely the plot from the 1989 movie.

The game consists in six stages, four of side-scrolling platform action and two side-scrolling shooter ones, in the following order: Gotham City Street, Axis Chemical Factory, Flugelheim Museum, Gotham City Street (with the Batmobile and after that on foot), In the Sky over Gotham City (with the Batwing) and the Cathedral, where Batman finally faces the Joker.

Batman can beat his enemies by punching them, slide kicking (by pressing down and the B button) or throwing his Batarang. By holding down the B button, Batman will block projectile-based attacks. He can also use his double jump (pressing the C button a second time while ascending) to leap greater distances or attack his enemies. To reach higher platforms, Batman can use his Grappling Hook (by pressing up and C to shoot, C again to climb). While piloting the Batmobile or the Batwing, Batman can shoot the Twin Vulcan Cannons (B button) or Twin Homing Missiles (A button).

Through the levels, Batman will collect Batman emblems (which will give him Batarangs or Twin Homing Missiles, depending on the stage played), Hearts (which give him health) and Batman heads (which give him an extra life).

	<path>./Battle Golfer Yui (Japan).md</path>
	<desc>Gil Hazard, president of the Hazard Foundation, is secretly Professor G, the leader of the evil Dark Hazard organization. He has designs on world domination, and has plans to use the power of golf toward this end; this is the Battle Golfer project. Yui Mizuhara and Ran Ryuzaki are two ordinary high school girls who just so happen to be golf prodigies, and so are prime candidates for the Battle Golfer project. They are abducted by Professor G, but are rescued by a mysterious man before they can be taken under his control. Having escaped, Yui hears about a golf tournament being held by the Hazard Foundation, and suspecting more nefarious plans, she secretly enters the tournament to stop him for good.

Battle Golfer Yui is a unique genre fusion between a golf game and a Japanese-style adventure game. The main adventure mode casts the player as Yui competing in the Hazard Cup tournament. The player can interact with other characters on the course, and will need to defeat several different opponents at match play on oddly-themed courses in order to proceed. The system is quite simple and fast-paced; simply choose a direction, a club, spin, and hit the bar with the right timing to adjust shot power. Each character also has special abilities to help them out, but these are limited in use. There is also a regular golf mode for one or two players, offered as both stroke and match play.</desc>

	<desc>A one on one fighting game seen from an isometric perspective. All beasts or dragons have two basic attacks: a punch and a tail attack, as well as a special attack that can only be performed while a certain icon is displayed. During close combat, pressing the A or C button rapidly will result in a throwing or choking attack. There is no visible health bar, but three icons are displayed at the bottom of the screen. Once a dragon is knocked down for a longer moment, one icon turns red. Once all icons are red, the fight is lost. The battle arena is surrounded by an electric fence, that opponents can be thrown into and which can also be used to initiate jump attacks.

There are two modes of play: Match and Tournament. Match is a single match for one or two players, where several different dragons are available. Tournament sees the player starting out with a week dragon who has to fight increasingly difficult battles and increase his stats (Power, Speed and Stamina). After every other battle, a shop can be visited that offers different items including food that increases Power, Speed or Stamina, Data Disks that contain information on other Dragons and more. After visiting the shop, Dragons can be trained. The training consists of simply selecting an attribute to be increased. At a few points in the game, it is possible to splice the player's Dragon's genes which that of a defeated Opponent to gain different abilities.</desc>
	<path>./Bishoujo Senshi Sailor Moon (Japan).md</path>
	<desc>The game is based on the popular manga/animé series of the same name. The heroine of the series is a 14-year-old schoolgirl named Serena (Usagi in the Japanese version).

	<path>./Blue Almanac (Japan).md</path>
	<desc>In the distant future, mankind has long left the Earth and spread all over the Milky Way. Humans settled down on different planets, sometimes coming into contact with other races, and established a connection between them. The player is a nameless young man who was a mere child when he survived a spaceship crash and had to seek shelter on a new planet. Now he is sixteen, and his parents send him as a foreign student to the planet Terra. That is where his adventure begins!

	<path>./Boogie Woogie Bowling (Japan).md</path>
	<desc>Championship Bowling is a standard bowling game for one or two players, and the only one available for the Genesis. The player picks one of four different bowlers and the ball they want to use, then heads out to the lanes. The player controls the throw, spin, and power by stopping bars at the right time.

The game includes three different play modes: standard bowling; spare mode, where a handful of pins are placed with the goal being to pick up a spare; and bonus mode, where specific pins are worth different amounts of points. Each mode can be played against either the computer or a friend, and there are three different lane types available. There is also a practice mode for each of the game types.

The Japanese version, Boogie Woogie Bowling, is largely the same but features different, more anime-style characters to play as (including a robot for no explained reason), as well as minor tweaks to the timing for throws.</desc>
	<path>./Burning Force (Japan).md</path>

Of course, it is up to our heroine to go on a solo mission, flying in her airbike around the Earth, fighting regular enemies and bosses, and ultimately saving the planet.

This is a pseudo-3D scrolling shooter similar to Space Harrier. The game is viewed from behind-the-character perspective. You can use regular fire attacks or limited super-powerful shots that do big damage.</desc>
	<path>./Chelnov (Japan).md</path>
	<desc>One windy day, there was an explosion at a nuclear power station, causing heavy doses of radiation to be poured over many people. One of these people was a young scientist named Chelnov. When he survived the deadly accident, he was possessed with abnormal powers. Having realized this, he decided to act in the cause of justice. He is determined to escape the Eastern Bloc country he called home and run and jump across the world to finish in the US.

What distinguishes Chelnov from other platform games is its use of forced scrolling. This occurs when the screen moves continuously from left to right, forcing players to negotiate the game's many obstacles and enemies without controlling Chelnov's speed of progress. Enemies attack from left, right, above, and below, and Chelnov can switch the direction he's facing to attack enemies that are behind him. Some enemies in the game carry different types of weapons and power-ups, and when they are shot at, the power-ups drop to the ground and can be picked up.</desc>

Arashi o Yobu Enji ("A Kindergartner Called Tempest") is one of many games based on the manga and anime created by Yoshito Usui. In four stages, each made up of five areas, Shin-chan must explore his neighborhood looking for a specific object.

After finding what he's looking for, Shin-chan will move on to the next area.

Also included is a minigame mode with eight different minigames, such as a bubble-blowing contest, a three-legged race, and a desperate search for clothing before school. The entire game, including the minigames, is filled with dialogue containing the same humor as the source material.

	<path>./Daikoukai Jidai II (Japan).md</path>
	<desc>In the first Uncharted Waters game, it was the 15th century and the New World was discovered. Now in New Horizons, it is the early 16th century and the age of exploration and sea trade is underway. Players choose from any one of six adventurers (scenarios), each with their own distinctive but intertwining plot, to embark on a quest of sailing, seamanship and exploration. The six characters are:

1. Joao Franco is the son of Duke Leon Franco, the hero of the first Uncharted Waters game and an influential man in Portugal. His father wants to make him into a strong man and so decides to send him out to sea. Young Joao is tasked with learning the skills of the sailor (he is the only character who starts at level one) and embarking on a quest of discovery; reaching the far east and eventually looking for the secret of Atlantis.

2. Catalina Erantzo is a Spanish naval officer who believes her beloved and her brother were both murdered by the Portuguese armada. Vowing revenge she turns to a life of piracy and soon becomes a red haired scourge of the seas.

3. Pietro Conti is a indebted man, having inherited the financial woes of the Conti family. When the Duchess Franco hires him to spy on her son, he accepts the job and obtains a ship. Pietro hopes to use these resources to seek out valuable treasure and clear up his family's debt.

4. Ernst Von Bohr is a geographer who is teaching classes in Holland. But he yearns to leave the classroom and sail the high seas, living a life of adventure that he has only read about in books. When his friend, Mercator offers to finance his initial voyage in exchange for cartography information about the world, Ernst is given the opportunity to live out his dream.

5. Ali Vezas is a poor orphaned child living in Istanbul and serving others. He dreams of becoming his own master and making his own fortune across foreign lands. A twist of fate aides in providing him with small loans, with which he is able to afford his first ship and sail out with a cargo hold full of goods...

6. Otto Baynes styles himself a Royal Knight of the British Empire, in the service of his majesty the king. Promoted to Admiral of the British fleet, the kingdom is worried about the increased naval power of Spanish fleets. Otto is given a letter of marque by the king and ordered to terrorize the Spanish Fleet. Equipping himself simply at first, Otto strives to become a great Privateer in the name of King and Country.

Regardless of the character chosen, Uncharted Waters: New Horizons is a top-down sailing simulation. At sea, players control the direction of their ship, where speed is affected by the number/health of the crew, the wind and the currents. Players can navigate anywhere there is water (though some ships are not ocean worthy) and discover interesting landmarks and new ports. Upon landing at a port, the view is also top-down and the player can enter different buildings, each with unique services and goods. These include: The Inn, the Item Shop, The Shipyard, The Tavern, The Castle, The Guild Hall, The Church, The Merchant and the Harbor. It's up to the player to earn enough gold to keep the crew fed and financed and keep the fleet repaired. Primary methods of earning money are through sea trade, accepting jobs from the guild, gambling and battle with other ships.

During naval combat, the game becomes a turn-based top-down strategy game, with the player moving ships in order to obtain trajectories needed to fire cannons at enemy ships, or run alongside enemy vessels in order to board them. If the player's flagship attacks the flagship of the enemy fleet, they can challenge the opponent to a duel. If accepted, the game changes to a side-view of the two captains engaged in a fight. During this sequence, the player can only choose which fighting maneuver (strike, thrust, parry, lash) they wish to engage in.

	<path>./Doraemon - Yume Dorobou to 7 Nin no Gozans (Japan).md</path>
	<desc>A dream thief has come and stolen the dreams of all the children, using them to create his own personal paradise where nobody may trespass. The children can't continue on without their dreams, and someone need to save them...that someone being Doraemon, the mechanical blue cat from the future! Finding his friends have lost their color, Doraemon flies into the sky and chases after the dream thief into his world of dreams.

Doraemon: Yume Dorobo to 7-nin no Gozans ("Doraemon: The Dream Thief and the Seven Gozans") is an action platform game based on the popular children's cartoon Doraemon. Doraemon must make his way through each of the seven dreamscapes, stunning enemies with a water pistol, throwing them out of his way, and collecting coins and stars. He can run and jump, and even flail his arms to extend the reach of his jumps.

	<path>./Double Dragon II - The Revenge (Japan).md</path>
	<desc>The lovely Marian was rescued from the clutches of the Black Warriors gang by Billy &amp; Jimmy Lee in the first Double Dragon game, but now the gang has killed her in retaliation of their early defeat. The Dragons must now embark on a mission to avenge her death and defeat the Black Warriors for the second and final time.

The original arcade version of "Double Dragon II" was essentially an improved version of the first game. In addition to offering renewed audio and visuals, as well as new traps, moves and enemy characters, "Double Dragon II" discarded the conventional punch and kick buttons in favor of a direction-oriented attacking system similar to the original Technos beat-em-up Renegade.

The NES version offered new stages, new moves and illustrated cut-scenes, as well as a new final boss and a new ending. Unlike the first NES game, it offered 2-Player Co-Op gameplay with the option to turn off the friendly fire.

The Game Boy version of "Double Dragon II" is an English localization of a "Kunio-kun" game (the Japanese franchise which inspired "Renegade" and "River City Ransom" and has nothing to do with the arcade and NES versions.

	<path>./Dragon Ball Z - Buyuu Retsuden (Japan).md</path>
	<desc>Dragon Ball Z: L'Appel Du Destin is a fighting game that maintains the dual screen mode previously seen in the DBZ Super Butouden series of the SNES, which allowed you to be far from the opponent yet still be able to see him by having the screen split between the two characters. This is important to note, as the most damaging attack of the game could be just executed from far away of your opponent, the energy fireball projectiles. These special attacks also need that you have your KI bar (which unlike energy one, is rechargeable) to a considerable level and the only way to block them is by means of a long button combination.

The constitution of the characters is based strictly on the Freezer and Cell sagas (Son Goku SSJ, Son Gohan SSJ2, Piccolo, Vegeta SSJ, Future Trunks SSJ, Krilin, Recoome, Ginyu, Freezer, A-18 and Perfect Cell), with special mention to Krilin, Ginyu and Recoome, who made here their first appearance in a fighting game. There are also 9 scenarios available, all of them corresponding to recognizable areas of the anime itself, some also appearing for 2 times but in different status (ie, "normal" Namek and Namek "in flames").

	<path>./Dream Team USA (Japan).md</path>
	<desc>The 1992 edition of Electronic Arts' basketball series centers on the 1992 Olympics in Barcelona and features the original US "Dream Team" with such legendary players as Michael Jordan, Magic Johnson, Larry Bird, David Robinson, John Stockton, Charles Barkley, Patrick Ewing and Karl Malone.

In addition to the US team there are 13 other national teams with real team rosters. There is also an "All-World" team with the best of the non-US players.

The game engine and gameplay mechanics are reused from the previous games in the NBA Playoffs series. There are new signature moves and the game features the international rules.</desc>
	<path>./Dyna Brothers (Japan).md</path>
	<desc>Dyna Brothers is a Strategy game, published by CRI,  which was released in Japan in 1992.</desc>
	<path>./Dyna Brothers 2 (Japan).md</path>
	<desc>Planet Jura is a green and beautiful place where dinosaurs have lived for longer than anyone can remember. One day, however, a giant black ship appears in the sky, and aliens come down to the surface and start attacking the dinosaurs. Feeling their suffering, the dinosaurs' creator, The Egg, awakens. To protect their race and their planet, the dinosaurs must fight the invading aliens, and force them to leave Planet Jura.

Dyna Brothers 2 is a real-time strategy game comparable to Populous. The player controls their small army of dinosaurs against the invading enemy alien army. There are six types of units, each of which has different skills and proficiencies. The player can order their dinosaurs to move or attack, and can also hatch new dinosaurs from The Egg. There are also environmental commands like earthquakes and lightning strikes.

The game features a practice mode, story mode, and free mode, as well as a 2-player versus mode where the second player takes the role of the alien invaders.</desc>
	<path>./Ecco the Dolphin (Japan).md</path>
	<desc>Travel through time along with Ecco the dolphin, in the only game that could call itself a "dolphin simulator". Indeed, you can do pretty much everything a typical dolphin does, including eating fish, surfacing in order to breathe, using your biological sonar and of course, jumping out of the water to amaze your friends.

The storyline is actually deeper that one may think by looking at the box illustration. As Ecco, you are the only dolphin who managed to escape from a giant whirlpool which sucked down your entire pod. The five shining stars on your forehead show that you are the chosen one to save them. But that task will be not be an easy one, as you will have to travel through time and space with the Atlantean time machine, and meet the mystical Asterite in order to defeat the Vortex Queen.</desc>
	<path>./Ecco the Dolphin II (Japan).md</path>
	<desc>The followup to Ecco the Dolphin, in which Ecco successfully destroyed the Vortex. Unfortunately, it turns out that the Vortex Queen followed it to the Earth and eventually destroyed the Asterite. All the world's oceans are threatened, and actually already doomed.

In order to restore the Asterite and finally defeat the Vortex Queen, Ecco will have to confront once again the tides of time, which have split into two possible futures, the regular one and the dark one dominated by the Vortex Queen.

Ecco: The Tides of Time features even better graphics than its predecessor, and introduces a new gameplay mode in which the camera follows the dolphin from behind instead of from the side.

	<path>./Eliminate Down (Japan).md</path>
	<desc>Eliminate Down is a horizontally-scrolling shooter similar in style to Thunder Force. The player has several weapons that can be freely switched (forward shot, back shot, and missile), and can also change the speed of the ship. Enemies come from all directions, and certain waves will drop powerups, including shields and weapon upgrades. The player needs to collect five upgrades in order to improve their weaponry, but the upgrade affects all three weapons.

The game includes eight stages, most of which include both a midboss and a boss at the end, and three difficulty settings. There is also a minigame similar to Whack-a-Mole where there is a grid of ship icons, and the player must hit the rotating ships.</desc>
	<path>./Europa Sensen (Japan).md</path>
	<desc>The game is an historical simulation of the European and North African theaters of World War II. The game allows up to two players to role-play as Army commanders for either the Axis or Allied forces. This game emphasizes the military aspects of the war and leaves diplomacy to the politicians.
</desc>
	<path>./Ex-Ranza (Japan).md</path>
	<desc>Ranger X was released fairly late in the lifetime of the megadrive. Coming from an unknown developer it was released with little fanfare and advertising but has become one of the best demonstrations of what the genesis/megadrive is capable of.

The game is a side scrolling shooter of sorts. You control a large mech (robot) which has a smaller side-kick mech which is a bit like a car. The two can join together providing an alternate shooting mode. Whilst controlling just the main mech however, the player can shoot both forward and back by using different buttons. The mech can also use it's rocket pack to boost off of the ground and hover for a short while. Levels are not necessarily left to right moving (although for the most part they are) and the game is an interesting blend of platform game and shoot-em-up.

The game features innovative graphics given the hardware limitations - there is a 3D introduction to most levels (remembering that the console had no 3D capability and a tile-based renderer) and some levels use a line-based scrolling effect to give the impression of 3D backgrounds.</desc>
	<path>./F1 Circus MD (Japan).md</path>
	<desc>F1 Circus '91 is a Formula 1 simulation racing game. The series did not yet feature an official license, and so just like the first game it only features generic team and driver names. The game itself plays much the same, with the overhead race view and focus on car tuning and damage. The World Championship mode has of course returned, though the managerial Constructors mode is no longer present. There is also a Free Attack mode, where any course can be freely practiced; a Training mode, where special training courses can be raced on to learn the ins and outs of the game; and a Watch mode, where the player can choose a course and watch a demonstration race.
</desc>
	<path>./F1 Hero MD (Japan).md</path>
	<desc>Following F1 Grand Prix Nakajima Satoru, Varie produced another racing simulation using the license. This time the racing is from a first person view aping Super Monaco Grand Prix. The car setup can be modified before you take to the track

There is a Time Attack mode, allowing you to go for as fast a laptime as possible on any of the game's 20 circuits (which include the 16 tracks of the 1992 Formula 1 season), as well as a full season mode, with qualifying and the race itself. Weather can be customised in the Time Attack mode but is randomly chosen in Grand Prix mode, while you can only choose one of the D-tier teams (the 4 weakest of the 16) in grand Prix mode, but can drive for McLaren, Williams et al in Time Attack.</desc>
	<path>./Fastest 1 (Japan).md</path>
	<desc>Fastest 1 is a Formula One racing game. The game doesn't have an official FIA license, but much like Human's Fire Pro Wrestling series, includes a number of recognizable fictionalized drivers, such as Ayrton Sesna and Satoru Inakajima. The game includes a world championship mode, where the player must start from the lowest rankings and win races to become the F1 world champion. There is also a battle mode where one or two players can race each other or against computer opponents, as well as a test run mode where the player can learn each course and try to set course records. There are a total of 16 different courses, which can be played in either dry, wet, or half-wet conditions, as well as a wide variety of vehicle settings that can be tweaked.</desc>
	<path>./Fatman (Japan).md</path>
	<desc>An eclectic, intriguing fighting game. Choose from different alien races (including Human) with different abilities and fighting styles, purchase weapons and devices, and fight your way through multiple opponents to face the Fatman.  Some of the more innovative features include being able to place wagers on the outcome of the fight, and the phenominon of a special move being less powerful the more you use it to balance gameplay.

2 player, head-to-head combat is supported.</desc>
	<path>./Final Blow (Japan).md</path>
	<desc>Final Blow is an action game based around the sport of boxing. You can play the fighters in a sequence of knock-out competitions, (the computer versions also include a round-robin league). Rounds last one minute, with a short break in between them. As in the real sport, your aim is to knock your opponent down for 10 seconds, by gradually weakening him with a series of punches. You can block punches, to avoid them inflicting damage onto you. The ring is of a limited size, so players can be cornered, although the referee will intervene to break the boxers up if they become entangled in a stalemate position.

The genesis version is not to be confused with the Master System game of the same name, which is entirely different.</desc>
	<path>./Fire Mustang (Japan).md</path>
	<desc>Fire Mustang is a fast side-scrolling shooter set during World War II. The player controls a P-51D Mustang plane through different missions, with many enemies on the screen at the same time and a large aircraft as a boss at the end of every mission. The Mustang has an unlimited amount of bullets, but one hit is sufficient to lose a life. There are different power-ups to collect, providing additional fire power and new firing patterns. Regardless of the power-ups, the Mustang shoots forward and drops bombs to the ground at the same time, targeting ground troops. There is a limited amount of forgers, large blasts damaging many enemies at once.</desc>
	<path>./Fire Pro Wrestling Gaiden (J) [c][!].md</path>
	<desc>Thunder Pro Wrestling Retsuden is a spinoff of Human's popular Fire Pro Wrestling series, and the only title in the series to appear on the Mega Drive. Like the other Fire Pro games, it is an arcade-style wrestling game featuring a roster of fictional wrestlers. The game includes a standard World Championship mode where the player picks a wrestler and fights his way to win the title. There is also an "Exciting" mode in which one or two players can play an exhibition singles or tag match against the computer or each other, an Elimination mode where each player picks a team of five wrestlers, and a "Handicap" mode where one fighter must alone take on a tag team.
</desc>
	<path>./Flintstone (Japan).md</path>
	<desc>This is a platform game based on the famous Flintstones series. The game features many original Flintstones characters, such as Fred, Wilma, Barney, and others. Instead of the usual "save the princess" or "liberate the world" kinds of a plot, "The Flintstones" is mainly based on small quests: Fred has to retrieve a lost item, etc. The large levels are divided into smaller stages. In the end of each level there is a boss battle. The gameplay involves mostly jumping and hitting the enemies on the heads with a club. The health is measured by hearts. During the game Fred will find many useful items, including some that will increase his health level.</desc>
	<path>./Fushigi no Umi no Nadia (Japan).md</path>
	<desc>This is one of the several games based on the animé series The Secret of Blue Water. The series (and the game) are loosely based on the stories by the famous French science fiction author Jules Verne. The game is set in 1889, a time of great inventions and technology progress unseen before. You play as Jean, a young genius scientist. In Paris he meets Nadia, an African circus performer. Nadia wears a pendant that contains magical powers, and that is why the evil Gargoyle is after her - this pendant is just the item she needs to build the ultimate weapon, the Tower of Babel. Jean will do anything to protect Nadia, and hope that his love to her, his adventurer spirit, and the power of science will eventually defeat Gargoyle!

Unlike most Japanese adventures, "Fushigi no Umi no Nadia" is a top-down, third-person perspective game, in which you actually move your character around. Nadia and other friends join Jean in a RPG-like fashion (although there is no combat in the game, different characters have their own item-based abilities you should use at certain points). There are no real puzzles in the game, but you'll often have to use your inventory items to make the game progress.

Not to confuse with other Fushigi no Umi no Nadia games (for NES, Turbo CD, etc.)!</desc>

	<desc>Gambler Jiko Chushinha: Katayama Masayuki no Mahjong Dojo is a traditional 4-player mahjong game based on the manga by Masayuki Katayama, one of many produced by Game Arts over the years. The game offers both a free play mode and a lighthearted story mode which follows Katayama's characters, a group of students who play mahjong to settle their differences. There is also a "Mahjong Dojo" mode which quizzes you on aspects of the game in order to help you learn how to play better.</desc>

	<path>./Gley Lancer (J).md</path>
	<desc>A side-scrolling sci-fi shooter, Gleylancer casts you as Lucia, a young pilot in the Space Fleet of starfighters that hijacks the experimental Gleylancer fighter to go explore the outer borders of known space in search of her missing father. Along the way Lucia will have to shoot down dozens of enemies in standard shooter fashion, while avoiding destruction and collecting power-ups that extend her ship's energy, upgrade weapons and gather screen-clearing bombs.

The Gleylancer comes equipped with two hovering satellites that can receive weapon upgrades of their own, and can lock their positions at specific angles to increase your firepower and protect the player from enemy attacks. Features only a single-player campaign with two different endings depending on how the final stages are completed (e.g. if Lucia's father is rescued or not).
</desc>
	<path>./Golden Axe III (Japan).md</path>
	<desc>This 'Prince of Darkness' has taken away the Golden Axe and put an evil curse over all the warriors. However, one of the heroes has their curse relieved and is sent to set things straight - lift curse off others, defeat the villian and return with the Golden Axe.

The gameplay has been expanded slightly, but is essentially the same hack n' slash as the previous games. New features to the series include new characters, new moves and junction points where you can choose which path to take.</desc>

Unleash some mad blasting action onto the Colonel's army and don't let him bring GoldenSilver to life!! The fate of Gunstar-9 is in your hands!</desc>
	<path>./Heavy Unit - Mega Drive Special (Japan).md</path>
	<desc>In an era of frequent alien attacks, the Earth has a unified Government, which relies on a line of cyborgs known as the Heavy Dolls for defense. The greatest of these are known as the Heavy Nova, a title earned by passing a rigorous training regime.

You are taking on the simulated proving grounds, which are split into two styles of alternating action. In the first you must progress (initially purely horizontally, though later with vertical flick-scrolling as well) through a hostile environment of enemies, bombs and traps, gaining points for doing it quickly and with lots of energy left. Initially you can fly and kick as needed.

Once this section is complete, you move on to one-on-one combat of the Street Fighter 2 style. The early foes have far less energy than you begin with. As you progress through the game, you are awarded extra attacking moves, in a manner similar to Brutal: Paws of Fury</desc>

	<path>./Honoo no Toukyuuji Dodge Danpei (Japan).md</path>
	<desc>Danpei Ichigeki is a young boy who loves dodgeball. Danpei's father was a famous dodgeball player when he was still alive, and he joins the Dodgeball Club at his elementary school. However, these kids are very serious about their dodgeball, and the road ahead isn't going to be easy for Danpei.

Dodge Danpei is a team dodgeball game, one of several based on the anime and manga created by Tetsuhiro Koshita, which plays strikingly similar to the well-known Super Dodge Ball. Each team has four main players and three support players, and attempts to knock out the opposing team's main members by throwing the ball at them in various ways. Apart from normal throws, the player can also pass to teammates, and execute special power throws which are harder to dodge or catch.

The game includes several different game modes, including the main story mode which follows the story of the anime, as well as one- and two-player exhibition matches. There is also a "league" mode which allows for a tournament of up to six teams, as well as a training mode where the game teaches the basics of how to play the game.</desc>
	<path>./Hybrid Front, The (Japan).md</path>
	<desc>The Hybrid Front is a turn-based strategy video game, released in Japan (exclusively) for the Mega Drive.

The introduction begins with someone logging into a computer. Then, it shows a revolution that occurred sometime in the 2080s leading into a series of wars and conflict that lead up to the video game's main setting of the 26th century. Since the second half of the 21st century, the depletion of fossil fuel resources have helped to deepen the conflict on Earth...
During the 24th century, the Earth was bombarded from orbit with massive optical weapons called the Metal Hammer by an Italian consortium; major cities around the world were burned to toast. The resistance would eventually be put down by CoCoON (abbreviation for COoperation COmmunity of Orbital Negotiation). Not only they would gain the corporate hegemony of humanity, CoCoON would develop a reputation as a hostile group of corporate war hawks; constantly revolting against the peaceful coalition of the PETO (abbreviation for Pan Earth Treaty Organization).

	<path>./Hyokkori Hyoutanjima (Japan).md</path>
	<desc>Hyokkori Hyotanjima: Daitoryo o Mezase! ("Aim for the Presidency!") is a sugoroku-style board game for up to four players based on the popular NHK children's show Hyokkori Hyotanjima. Four characters from the show all decide they want to be the island's president, and so they set off to start campaigning.

The goal of each round is to collect the most points; points can be earned or lost based on the spaces the player lands on. The round ends when a player reaches the destination set at the start of the round, which gives a points bonus. The player with the most points after a set number of rounds is the winner.
</desc>
	<path>./Hyper Marbles (SN) (Japan).md</path>
	<desc>In the future, even the simple kids game of marbles is high-tech and extreme. Hyper Marbles takes the basic concept of the classic kids game -- to knock the opponent's marbles out of the playfield -- and gives it a futuristic sci-fi twist. The player directs their robotic marble around the field, attempting to push their opponents into the deadly electrified walls lining the arena. Aiding in this is a jet booster, which can cause opponents to bounce quite far, but if overused will overheat and must cool down before being used again. There are ten different arenas, each with different hazards like oil slicks and moving barriers. There is a single player mode, where the goal is to destroy all enemies to move on, as well as a two-player versus mode where the goal is to destroy the other player.</desc>
	<path>./I Love Mickey &amp; Donald - Fushigi na Magic Box (Japan).md</path>
	<desc>World of Illusion is sort of a follow-up to Castle of Illusion. Mickey Mouse and Donald Duck are taken to a magic world and have to get back home. In order to do that, they can play magical tricks and interact to each other in a 2-player mode. Like other Disney games for SEGA consoles of the same period, the game has cartoon-like graphics and is played as a side-scrolling platformer.</desc>
	<path>./I Love Mickey Mouse - Fushigi no Oshiro Dai Bouken (Japan).md</path>
	<desc>This is the first Mickey Mouse game for Sega consoles. In this game the famous Disney character must face the dangers of weird fantasy lands such as an enchanted forest and a toy world. Mickey must rescue his girlfriend Minnie who's been kidnapped by the evil witch Mizrabel.

The game play follows the traditional 2D hop 'n' bop platform style in both 8-bit and 16-bit versions. Apart from the story and the music, which is the same, all the rest (including controls, moves, stages and, obviously, graphics), are totally different.</desc>
	<path>./Ichidant R (Japan).md</path>
	<desc>Ichidant-R is the second game in the Puzzle &amp; Action series, and the sequel to Tant-R. Twenty new minigames are present, including rocketship assembly, a batting contest, and hitting the brakes on a speeding car.

The game once again includes an arcade mode for one or two players. This time, the player is questing to rescue a kidnapped princess from an evil knight. There is also a quest mode which plays like a simple RPG, where battles are fought via minigames. Of course, the four-player competition and free modes also make a return, rounding out the package.</desc>
	<path>./J. League Champion Soccer (Japan).md</path>
	<desc>European Club Soccer has dozens of teams from all across Europe (around 170), and each country is represented by at least two teams. In addition to correct club names, it also has recognizable imitations of team badges and kits; although more elaborate kits (such as those worn by Juventus, FC Porto or Celtic F.C.) are simplified (Juventus have a silver shirt, Porto blue and Celtic green). Player names, on the other hand, were made by mixing names found on real squads. Portuguese teams, for instance, had a large number of Yugoslavian players in the early 1990s, and that was reflected by players with names such as Valentim Ivic (of Valentim Loureiro and Tomislav Ivic, then Boavista FC chairman and S.L. Benfica manager, respectively). Names could not be changed, and since the game lacked a battery, it does not store changes done to kits and passwords were used to resume tournaments (example of a password sheet). Rotherham United are included amongst the English clubs despite never playing in the top tier of English football, this is due to the developer, Krisalis Software, being based in Rotherham. All other clubs have played in their own country's top tier.</desc>
	<path>./J. League Pro Striker - Perfect Edition (Japan).md</path>
	<desc>Pro Striker Perfect is an updated version of the original release that features updated player statistics and the addition of the 1993 East and West All-Star teams. It is otherwise identical to the original release.

	<path>./J. League Pro Striker (Japan).md</path>
	<desc>Pro Striker is the first title in Sega's early-'90s soccer franchise. It is an arcade-style soccer game similar in play to Sega's earlier World Championship Soccer. The game is viewed from a birds-eye perspective with a full field minimap on the side of the screen. The player can also make substitutions and choose from six different formations. It features an official J.Leauge license, including all ten teams and all players from the 1993 season. There is an exhibition mode, a playoff mode, and a full league mode, and up to four players can play simultaneously.
</desc>
	<path>./J. League Pro Striker 2 (Japan).md</path>
	<desc>Pro Striker 2 is the sequel to the first title, and is a very similar soccer game to the previous year's model. The updates are largely cosmetic, with the game retaining the same top-down view and field minimap. Of course, the full 1994 J.League team and player roster is included. The exhibition, playoff, and league modes are back from the first game, as well as the all-star mode that was added in its update. Once again, up to four players can play simultaneously, and the menu system has also been greatly streamlined.
</desc>
	<path>./J. League Pro Striker Final Stage (Japan).md</path>
	<desc>Pro Striker: Final Stage is the last title in Sega's 16-bit soccer franchise, and once again features a full J.League license, including all teams and players, and four-player simultaneous play. This entry in the franchise features a completely new game engine with a side view, rather than the aging overhead engine used previously. Each mode from the previous title has returned: exhibition, tournament, league, and all-star modes are available. There is also a new penalty kick contest mode.

	<desc>A daughter of the chair of a local high school, Yu Honjo, has been kidnapped by someone unknown. Unable to go to the police, the girl's sister, Mai, hires a private investigator to find out what happened to her. The only piece of evidence is a photograph from the night of Yu's disappearance, where the missing girl and three other students from the same school are playing a game of mahjong.

Jantei Monogatari is a hybrid of a traditional-style Japanese adventure game and a regular mahjong game. The player takes the role of the unnamed private investigator, and moves from place to place via menus, talking to different characters. The investigation happens through playing mahjong with each suspect: win and they'll tell you a bit more of what they know. At first, the investigator can only speak with the three girls in the photo, but as he wins games of mahjong against them, he gains information and experience that allow him to find new clues and talk to more suspects. The investigator will need to play against a dozen different opponents in his attempt to find out what happened to the kidnapped girl.</desc>

It is a platform game with a lot of various levels: jungle, underwater, volcanic caves, on the ice... Toki's only weapons are spitting on the enemies or jumping on them and crashing them. There are many possibilities to upgrade his spitting "weapon"; for example, if he finds an upgrade, he can spit fireballs. 

This game is ported from an older arcade version.</desc>

	<desc>The Sega Genesis game based on the Jurassic Park movie/book differs from the games made by Ocean for other platforms. Basically, Sega's Jurassic Park is a side-scrolling action game.  You jump from platform to platform, pick up weapons and health items, and try to make it to the end of the level with all your lives intact.

This version of Jurassic Park does feature an interesting twist, however. You can play it either as Dr. Grant, or as a Velociraptor. The story and level design changes based on which character you use.</desc>

	<desc>This is a vertical platformer with horizontal wrap-around. For the entertainment of the futuristic masses, you play a criminal that has been inserted into a mechanical body with the promise that if you succeed in surviving through all the levels (there are many and they are hard), you will be set free.
You start each level at the bottom, near pooling liquid which will soon rise, at your immediate peril. Navigate the level from bottom to the exit at the top before the liquid rises and kills you. There are many other foes that fly around, causing you damage and basically annoying you to spit.
Most levels must be navigated through a series of keyed gates, doors, or portals. These shaped keys are scattered around the map and must by picked up and used only on the gates they match individually.
Twist: You can only carry one special weapon (triple shot, laser beam, or vertical shot) and one tool (key, liquid-freeze, or a red herring) at a time.
This game requires a lot of memorization of enemy movement patterns and optimum routes.
A unique feature is that when you die, you can watch a replay and take over at any point to continue your game.
You can also hit the HELP button at the start of each level to view a map, helping you plan your route.</desc>

	<desc>"Langrisser II" is a sequel to  Warsong (whose original title is Langrisser). The events of the game take place several years after those described in "Warsong". Gone is the benevolent kingdom of Baltia, and a new power has risen - the Rayguard Empire, led by Emperor Bernhart and his four generals.

You can also cast healing spells on your units or offensive spells to hurt the enemy.

The major difference between "Langrisser II" and its "remake", Der Langrisser for SNES, is the absence of branching storyline in Genesis release.</desc>

Devil Hunter Yoko is about Yoko Mano, who was a regular girl making her way through high school--until she learned that she is the 108th successor to a line of warriors charged with defending the earth against demons. 

Every woman born into the Mano family has taken up the role of the legendary Devil Hunters, warriors who battle demons and other forces of darkness who threaten Earth. The realm of the demons (which is parallel to our world) is in cross-dimensional alignment with our own, which could cause a portal to open, allowing the demons to cross over, and launch an all-out attack. The demons are trying to destroy Yoko before she can take her rightful place as the 108th generation Devil Hunter. She must stop the demons before they can perform the ritual that will mean the end of the human race.

Mamono Hunter Yoko: Dai 7 no Keisho is a side scrolling action/platformer game along the lines of Valis. You control Yoko who is equipped with a sword, which you use to slash your enemies. Also if you hold the attack button you can create a shield which will block weak attacks. The shield can also then be thrown to attack enemies. You play through various different worlds, such as a plant type stage, a water stage, a cave stage, a snow stage, etc.

	<desc>Megapanel is a tile-based puzzle game that plays like a mixture of Tetris Attack and a traditional sliding tile puzzle. Blocks rise from the bottom of a well, and the player must slide them around in order to create a row or column of three same-color blocks.

As the game continues, the number of blocks that must be cleared to continue as well as the speed at which the stack rises will both increase.

The game includes three modes. First is training mode which explains the basics of the game. In this mode, a certain number of blocks must be cleared to complete the stage. Second is a "pin-up" mode for one player, where clearing blocks reveals parts of an image of a cute anime girl, the goal being to uncover the entire picture. Last is a two-player versus mode, where players compete to clear their blocks the fastest, and can send garbage blocks to their opponent and fill up their field. The game includes two difficulty settings, two versus modes, a sound test, and a unique mode that displays the entire game in sepia tone.</desc>

Each "race" is made up of two heats of two parts each, and hits or kills on the other team earns points. During each heat, each team takes one turn attacking (four vehicles on the course) and one turn defending (three vehicles on the course). The team with the most points at the end of the last heat wins a reward and moves on to the next match.

However, your team won't get very far with just its basic equipment. After choosing your team's colors and members, you must then purchase upgrades for each person: engines, fuel, AI, armor, and of course weapons. During the game, you can switch freely between each member of your team. Your vehicle automatically moves forward around the track, but you can turn, throttle, and brake in order to move closer to or escape from the other team.

After each successful match there is a game of chance where winnings can be increased. There is also a two-player simultaneous battle mode.</desc>

She can also use items and equip weapons and armor, talk to people, and open treasure chests. Later in the game, she will also be able to use magic, and a little blue pet animal will assist and help her on her journey. The combat system is very similar to the classical Zelda style. Health and mana points are measured in little hearts, and the more you progress in the game, the more hit points you gain.

The game was released only in Japan. It is sometimes erroneously called "Wonder Boy 6".</desc>

	<desc>Futuristic, intergalactic war disguised as American Football, Mutant League Football was one of the most unique football games ever to hit the gaming market. It's a unique blend of sports and sci-fi, and the actual football is the good ol' smash-mouth kind, literally.

Dynamite throwing running backs, blitzing trolls, robots that bleed oil, it's all here. Opposing quarterback connecting on too many passes? Blitz him 'til he's dead. Suspect the ref's been bribed by the other side? Call a Kill Ref audible; it's a 5 yard penalty though. 

Take your pick from nineteen teams, including three All-Star teams. There are five difficulty levels and a slow/fast game speed toggle. A tournament mode awaits those who want something more than a quick game versus the computer or a friend.

There are nineteen different fields to play on, all with there own special quirks. The Hellfield is littered with mines and fire pits to put an end to a careless runner, while The Pen is a slippery sheet of ice.</desc>

Fortunately, during the kidnapping process, Tiki, leader of the tribe, managed to escape the sack, and her job is to rescue Phee-Phee and the other kiwis scattered around New Zealand, and are held in cages in various locations that include Auckland, Rotorua, Waitomo Caves, Strait Cook, and Mt. Cook. 

If Tiki doesn't rescue a kiwi in a limited amount of time, the devil will appear and try to kill her. When Tiki reaches the outskirts of each city, except Strait Cook, there is a boss waiting to meet Tiki, and kill her by using their own choice of weapons. Also making the rescue mission difficult are several nasties that attempt to throw their own weapons, like bombs and arrows, at her. To defeat these enemies, Tiki shoots at them using her crossbow and arrows. More often than not, when Tiki shoots at enemies, they will leave behind pieces of fruit that she can pick up for points. However, it is likely that Tiki may get other weapons or the letters E, X, T, E, N, and D. Collecting all these letters will result in an extra life, and as for the weapons, they include laser shots, bombs, and fireballs. 

In some levels, a few areas are located further up than just left or right, and the only way that Tiki can go up is by snatching something off the enemy that gives her the ability to fly up. Other areas are underwater, and when Tiki goes underwater, her oxygen meter decreases, so she has to rise up to the surface again to restore her oxygen levels. Apart from her own weapons, Tiki is able to squirt water at enemies if she gets to the top of the water.</desc>

	<path>./Ninja Burai Densetsu (Japan).md</path>
	<desc>Ninja Burai Densetsu  is a 1991 strategy game by Sega for the Sega Mega Drive released exclusively in Japan.

The game plays similarly to other strategy games such as SystemSoft's Daisenryaku games and Sega's own Shining games. You are in control of a team of ninjas fighting another team. C selects a ninja/confirms an action. B cancels an action, or if no action is in progress, selects the next ninja. A opens the battle menu, which allows you to end your turn. Battles are fully automatic.

Unlike most other fighting games, you can control only one character (Joe) in single-player mode. In two-player mode, you can choose to fight as any of the seven available fighters, and also choose a scenery. The game plays like a standard 2D fighter: you can punch, kick, and jump on you opponents, but the fights are not entirely 2D, since you can also take a few steps vertically.</desc>

The game is a platformer with heavy shooting elements and consists of 10 levels. Many enemies stand in RoboCop's way and must be destroyed via 8 different weapons. RoboCop begins the game with only a basic pistol, but other weapons can be found, including flame and grenade throwers, laser guns, self-seeking missiles and others. While all guns have unlimited ammo, only two can be carried at the same time and being killed means the currently equipped gun is lost.

The game is evenly split between present and future levels. Enemies in present Detroit include mostly street punks and other criminal elements while the future is of course populated by deadly machines: Terminators, robotic dogs and spiders and many automated guns. Each level ends with a boss battle, featuring Terminators, heavy tanks and RoboCop's famous adversaries ED-209 and Cain (aka RoboCop 2).

There are ten levels in the game in which you will face aerial, aquatic, and ground enemies. They all fire scores of missiles at you in an attempt to knock you from the sky. 

In between levels, your plane will land on a runway for refueling and maintenance. You will receive bonus points for the number of bombs left in your hold and the number of lightning bolt icons you picked up in the prior level.

There are also many power-ups available in each level. Slow-moving blimps contain a power-up icon which is revealed after the zeppelin explodes. Other icons appear when various other enemies or buildings are destroyed. These power-ups will float around the screen for several seconds. Grabbing them with your plane earns you a weapon upgrade or bonus points.

The standard weapons are the bomb and the Wide Shot. As power-ups are obtained the number of shots per blast can increase up to 16. The Wide Shot is a comparatively weak weapon that usually requires multiple hits to take an enemy down.

The Shark Beam is a green laser that fires in a spiral pattern and the strongest weapon of all is the Super Fire. It will fire continuously while the fire button is held. Power-ups increase its beam count to 4.</desc>

At a certain stage, any of the 10 rounds can be selected while playing but a new stage will only be opened up when all rounds have been successfully completed. To complete a round, Stevedore needs to push all boxes on the designated spots. This will turn them into a different colour. This is no easy task as the level design will obstruct many moves and cornered boxes can no longer be moved. While playing it is possible to restart the round, undo the last step and the game keeps track of the number of steps taken.

The game supports passwords and includes an edit mode where new levels can be designed and played.</desc>

	<path>./Sonic Eraser (Japan).md</path>
	<desc>Sonic Eraser is a puzzle game very similar to Columns that features Sega mascot Sonic the Hedgehog. Pieces in different arrangements drop into a well; if two or more matching pieces touch, they disappear and the above pieces fall to take their place. There are four different single-player game modes:

1. Round: Each stage starts with pieces in the well already. There are several spinning green pieces, which must all be destroyed to finish the stage.

2. Normal: A standard endless mode in which the game speed continually rises as matches are made.

3. Doubt: No white-colored blocks will appear in the drop formations, but often a random block in the formation will change to a white block after it is placed.

4. Block: Similar to Normal mode, but blocks will not fall out of formation until a match is made, allowing for impressive clear combos.

These modes can be played either single player or two-player simultaneous on separate fields. There is also a versus mode for one or two players, in which creating a combo of three or more clears will attack the opposing player, which causes them to lose control of their pieces for a short time.</desc>

	<path>./Sonic the Hedgehog (Japan).md</path>
	<desc>Sonic the Hedgehog is the first of many games starring Sega's premier rodent, Sonic. It's a side scrolling platform game with a difference: speed. Sonic rushes through levels with incredible speed, allowing him to traverse loops and jumps with ease. 

The plot of the game is simple. The evil Dr. Robotnik has captured many of Sonic's animal friends, and trapped them inside robots. Fortunately, Sonic can free his friends by destroying the robots with his spin attack. Meanwhile, Dr. Robotnik is trying to control the all-powerful chaos emeralds. Sonic must grab them before he does in the 3D rotating bonus levels. 

Sonic's weapon is his spin attack; while jumping, Sonic destroys hostile robots by touch. Throughout the platforming levels, Sonic collects numerous rings. If Sonic is hit by an enemy, all the rings he's carrying fall out and scatter around; Sonic can quickly grab the rings back before they disappear. If Sonic is hit while not carrying any rings, he dies. Collecting 100 rings gives Sonic an extra life. There is also an invincibility bonus which temporarily protects Sonic from all attacks. 

The game is divided into several "zones", each of them containing three levels. At the end of each zone Sonic confronts Dr. Robotnik in a boss fight. 

Sonic the Hedgehog is a significant game because it gave Sega it's first real mascot, and established the Genesis as the video game system with "attitude."</desc>
	<path>./Sonic the Hedgehog 3 (Japan).md</path>
	<desc>Dr. Robotnik's Death Egg has crash-landed on Floating Island, so called because it harnesses the power of the Chaos Emeralds to float in the air.  Robotnik needs them to repair the Death Egg, so he tells the guardian of Floating Island, Knuckles the Echidna, that Sonic and Tails are there to steal them. With Knuckles tricked and trying to stop the heroes at every turn, will they be able to stop Robotnik in time?

Sonic the Hedgehog 3 is the third in the Sonic series of games. As with the previous games, it is a side-scrolling platformer based around speed. The basic game remains the same - players collect rings to earn extra lives, which are also used for protection, and scatter everywhere when Sonic is hurt. Sonic can jump on enemies to defeat them, and Spin Dash by holding down and the jump button, then letting go of down.

New to Sonic 3 are three different types of shields - the Fire Shield (which protects you from fire but disappears if you enter water), the Water Shield (which lets you breathe underwater infinitely) and the Electric Shield (which pulls nearby rings towards you). Sonic can use extra abilities when he has these shields by pressing jump while in the air - either a horizontal fireball dash, a vertical bubble bounce, or an electric double jump. If Sonic has no shield active, he can activate a brief energy shield, also by pressing jump in the air. Tails cannot use the shields' special abilities, but he can instead either fly or dog paddle (in water) for a limited time. He can also carry Sonic with him while doing so.

There are now two types of bonus stages - one is available by collecting 50 or more rings, running past a checkpoint lamppost and then jumping into the stars (as you could in Sonic the Hedgehog 2. This stage give you the chance to earn bonus rings, lives and power-ups. In this stage, there is a giant gumball machine. By hitting the crank, you'll spit out a bonus item that can either be rings, lives or bonus shields. The stage is over when you fall down the bottom of the screen.

The other, more important, Special Stage can be accessed by jumping into giant rings that are hidden away in secret areas in each level. In these stages, you must collect all the blue spheres while avoiding the red ones (which end the stage early). Collecting all of the outer blue spheres around square or rectangle sphere formations will turn them all into rings - if you collect 50 or more in this stage, you can earn a continue. Once you collect all the blue spheres in the stage, it clears and you earn one of the seven Chaos Emeralds.

Sonic 3 features six different Zones, which are made up of two Acts. At the end of each Act is a boss that must be defeated to complete the stage and rescue Sonic's animal friends that Robotnik has captured to turn into Badnik robots. The zones in Sonic 3 are approximately three times bigger than those in Sonic 2, and feature multiple, branching paths.

As with Sonic 2, there is a two-player Vs. Mode, which plays in a split-screen horizontal style. There are special monitor pick-ups in this mode which do things like swap player positions, lose rings, or cause a Badnik to appear. You can also race against the clock in a time trial mode.</desc>
	<path>./Sorcer Kingdom (Japan).md</path>
	<desc>Sorcerer's Kingdom is a mix of RPG and strategy game. You play a young adventurer, who is sent out by the king to find out the reason for the increasing number of monsters that threaten the land and restore peace to the kingdom. Starting out as an Adventurer you are eventually given higher titles by the king, as a reward for completing quests. 

The game plays like a typical RPG but the battles are a little unusual. Whenever you are attacked or attack a monster that is within your current range, a turn-based battle starts immediately without taking you to a separate fighting area, and you have to fight all enemies that were visible the moment the battle started.</desc>
	<path>./Sorcerian (Japan).md</path>
	<desc>Sorcerian is the fifth game in the Dragon Slayer series. It is set in the fantasy land known as Pentawa, whose inhabitants are in constant need of protection from ferocious creatures roaming the wilderness. The king of Pentawa hires a party of adventurers, and their first assignment is to retrieve a precious sceptre from a dungeon, where it is guarded by the evil demonic lord Ouks.

The game is an RPG with an unusual side-scrolling perspective and action-based combat, somewhat of a cross between Wizardry and platform games. Despite being a Japanese game, Sorcerian resembles Western RPGs of its time, focusing more on character development than story. In the beginning, the player creates a party of four characters, choosing between fighter, wizard, elf, and dwarf (races and classes are not distinguished). Beside the usual inns and shops, there are many things that can be done in the towns of the game, including complex development of magical spells (up to 120 spells of different disciplines), training to raise personal skills (strength, intelligence, etc.), enchanting weapons with elemental magic, as well as looking for part-time jobs.

The view switches to side-scrolling when the party ventures into a hostile area. Combat is performed in real time, with the player controlling the entire party at once. The lead character can be changed at any time, and battle actions will be carried out by whoever is in front. Melee attacks and magic spells are unleashed by pressing corresponding buttons. The characters can also jump and interact with objects by bumping into them. Dungeons are usually maze-like, and some contain simple puzzles such as finding and activating hidden switches to open doors.</desc>

There is no scenario mode, and any of the included maps can be played. Some maps are for two players, some for four, and any map can be played with any combination of human and computer players.

The game is played on a large map made up of hexagonal spaces, each of which is a specific type of terrain. Each player controls a number of units, which each take up one space on the grid. Different units have different strengths and weaknesses toward other units, which are also affected by the terrain. Each player controls a capital, and the goal is to capture the other players' capitals.</desc>

	<path>./Tetris (Japan).md</path>
	<desc>Tetris is one of many conversions of the famous block-stacking game, this one is based on the 1988 coin-op version produced by Sega. The goal is to place pieces made up of four tiles in a ten-by-twenty well, organizing them into complete rows, which then disappear. As rows are cleared, the pace of the game increases and the background changes, and the game ends if the stack reaches the top of the well.

In addition to a standard endless mode for one or two players, the game also includes a "time trial" mode for one or two players, where the goal is to get as many points as possible in three minutes. There is also a "doubles" mode, where two players work together to fill lines in an extra-wide well, each controlling their own pieces simultaneously.

The game offers a number of standard options: setting the starting level, how much "garbage" is at the bottom of the well when the game starts, and whether the next piece is visible. There are also optional "item blocks," which are special flashing pieces that give an extra bonus if they are used to clear a line.</desc>

	<path>./Time Dominator 1st (Japan).md</path>
	<desc>A fast-paced platform game in the vein of the classic Sonic the Hedgehog. The evil overlord Time Dominator has constructed a time machine and is using it to steal treasures from the past, creating a warp in the flow of time. The Time Warp Patrol, created to prevent this sort of thing from happening, sends the special time-traveling duck Socket (or Minutes in the Japanese version) to fix the flow of time and stop Time Dominator.

Socket has reasonably basic abilities: he can jump, kick to the side or straight upward, and run quite fast. As Socket is a robot, his energy level continually drains from simply being in operation; thankfully, there are a liberal amount of electric bolts strewn about each stage, which will refill his health when picked up. Getting hit by enemies will take a chunk out of his life bar.

There are seven different themed zones, each with four separate parts. First up is the High Speed Zone, which is a gateway level leading to the next zone, and as the name suggests it encourages high speed play. Next is the Athletic Zone, which generally entails lots of jumping, and the Labyrinth Zone, which is focused on exploration and simply finding a path to the exit. At the end of each Labyrinth Zone, Socket faces off against Time Dominator in a boss round, then moves on to the next High Speed Zone.

The game also features a sound test mode and a time trial mode, where the High Speed Zone stages can be played without any enemies present with times being recorded.</desc>

The game lets the player choose whether to play on a US or Japanese golf course. Once out on the course, the player must choose which golf club to use, where to make contact with the ball, and where to aim in the direction they want the ball to go. Once that's decided the player fills a swing meter and hits the ball trying to get the ball into the hole.</desc>

Uchu Senkan Gomorrah (Space Battle Ship Gomorrah) is a horizontally-scrolling shooter based on the 1990 coin-op of the same title. The player controls the titular ship, Gomorrah, which can shoot both straight forward as in most shooting games, as well as freely in any direction via an aiming cursor, which is controlled independently of the ship itself. Additionally, there are several power-ups that can be found, including speed-ups, additional mounted guns, and the life-up, which will not only increase the ship's armor, but also cause it to grow in size as well.

The game features 9 stages, each with a boss at the end, as well as one or two-player simultaneous play. The game difficulty has been rebalanced from the arcade to compensate for the lack of a trackball to control the aiming cursor; the player must stop their ship in order to move the cursor.

After crashing his ship on Earth while in pursuit of the evil alien Bemular, the super-being Ultraman is here to help whenever the attacking aliens prove too much for humanity alone to handle. Standing hundreds of feet tall with incredible strength and amazing abilities, he can only remain on Earth for a few minutes, and so must defeat his foes before his power drains completely.

Based on the popular television show from 1967, Ultraman directly follows the story of its source material. Cast in the role of the titular Ultraman, the player must defeat many of the same monsters that appeared in the original series. Taking the appearance of a 1-on-1 fighting game, Ultraman can punch, kick, and grapple his opponent, as well as use a variety of various special moves that must be charged. However, in order to actually defeat his opponent, Ultraman must deplete their continually-recharging life bar, and at that moment hit with his most powerful special attack: the Specium Beam. As the game continues, different enemies may even find ways to avoid this most formidable attack, and Ultraman must adapt... Each stage has a time limit of only three minutes, and there are three lives and no continues.</desc>

	<desc>Humanity has long since advanced into space, and colonies have been established on many planets, but humanity has yet to contact any alien life. However, an emergency signal has come from the planet Shirakusa. During a colonization survey, contact was lost with the battleship Aphrodite. As a member of the elite Verytex squad, you are sent to investigate.

Verytex is a vertically scrolling space shooter with vague organic themes. There are six stages and three different weapon types: Normal Shot, a standard multidirectional cannon; Beam Laser, a powerful forward-shooting weapon; and Boomerang Laser, a wide-range forward shot. Each weapon type can be upgraded to three increasing levels of power. Also available are homing missiles, which are also upgradeable, as well as smart bombs and shield pickups.</desc>
	<path>./V-Five (Japan).md</path>
	<desc>This cartridge combines two different localized flavours of the original arcade game. There are two modes, Grind Stormer and V Five. Both offers the same levels and enemies, but have a different approach to how the player can use power-ups.

In this hectic, top-down, vertically-scrolling shooter where the screen is constantly filled with enemies and bullets, players have a constant, unlimited firing rate, enhanced by power-ups that include missiles, target-seeking bullets, shields, additional speed, extra power and bonus points. In Grind Stormer the ship always moves at a fast speed and the player can collect bombs that damage the entire screen and fend off bullets. The other variant V Five takes a Gradius-approach to power-ups, having the player advance through a selection of power-ups shown on the right by collecting tokens. In the first mode power-ups are immediately applied. In the second mode the ship is much slower and the player needs to decide to spend tokens on speed power-ups right away or save them to advance to seeking bullets or additional power.

The game difficulty, amount of lives and continues can be set in the options. After using a continue, the player immediately receives a "Special" power-up granting four wingmen.</desc>

	<desc>In 2384 AD, a great interstellar war took place. The Earth emerged victorious, thanks to a secretly developed robot weapon called "Serd". After the war, the usage of Serds was not a secret any more, and various nations started using them for military purposes. Several years, a more powerful weapon named Vector was developed. The usage of such highly destructive weapons led to wars between the nations of the world. You control Takuya Murasawa and his comrades, member of a special military force called Slash. Everything begins with an attack of unidentified Vectors on their base...

"Vixen 357" is an animé-style strategy/RPG game with mech combat. You control your robots by moving them over the battle map, and fighting enemies with long-ranged or melée attacks. An animated battle sequence is shown when you and enemy robots attack each other. You can switch pilots in the robots and repair them during battles. Your pilots level up by gaining experience points, and you'll be able to acquire new robots and weapons during the game.</desc>

Two small dinosaurs with very large hammers, Charlie and Smiley, make their way through numerous screens of platforms and ladders filled with enemies. Their only method of attack is to bash a hole in the ground, wait for an enemy to fall into it, and then bash the enemy in the head, which causes the enemy to fall and transform into items and delicious food.

There are five worlds, each with several screens and large boss at the end, as well as a minigame between worlds where bonus items can be earned. The game can be played alone or two-player cooperatively.</desc>

	<desc>Wonder Boy III: Monster Lair is a quite different game to most of the games in the Wonder Boy series. You play a green-haired dude who must attack the invaders that attempt to collect weapons and use them to destroy the land. The game starts out like a simple platform game, but it's just when Wonder Boy enters the skull further on that the game is transformed into a shoot 'em up, so basically the gameplay consists of action and shooter scenes.

In the action scenes, your vitality decreases as you make your way towards the skull, but this can be restored by collecting fruit. A wide variety of weapons can be picked up, and not only does these allow you to use the weapons for a limited amount of time, but they also increase your vitality. 

In the shooter scenes, you ride your pink friend as you make your way through the scene. Here, your vitality remains static unless you are hit by an enemy passing by. As usual, there is a boss waiting for you at the end which you must defeat. Every boss changes color to show how much damage has been done to it. You have to defeat some bosses in two stages.

If your vitality gets low in each scene, you'll lose a life. You can also choose to have Wonder Girl join you, as two players can play the game.

	<desc>Based on the manga/animé series Yu Yu Hakusho. This is a story of a teenager delinquent Yuusuke Urameshi, who was hit by a car while trying to save a child. However, there was no place found for him either in paradise or in hell, and Koenma, the son of the death god Enma, sends him back to our world, where he has to be an "occult detective" and to fight against demons. Several characters join him on his quest: Kazuma Kuwabara, his ex-rival and best friend; Kurama, a 1400-year-old demon fox; and Hiei, formerly a demon who tried to conquer the world and had to repent for his sins by helping Yuusuke.

You must play the individual chapters of the four playable characters (Yuusuke, Kuwabara, Kurama, and Hiei), until in the final chapter you control them all in the ultimate confrontation against evil forces. The game is a Japanese-style adventure (no puzzles, menu-driven interface) with the addition of battles. The battles are real time; similarly to fighting games, you can kick, punch, defend, and use special techniques. Unlike most Japanese adventures, you view the game world from platform-like third person perspective (although you cannot move physically in adventure mode).

	<path>./Zan Yasha Enbuden (Japan).md</path>
	<desc>Zan: Yasha Enbukyoku is a turn-based strategy game set in feudal Japan.

The background for the game's events is the ongoing battle between noble warriors, known as yasha, and demons. Between the two stand the "middle people", i.e. other Japanese generals and rulers. The player can choose to play as either yasha, demonic, or "middle" army. 

The player has to manage his army, deploying units for protection and attack, as well as negotiating with other rulers. Events such as earthquakes, plagues, etc. occur randomly. Diplomacy doesn't always work, so battles against enemy armies occupy a large portion of the game. The battles are somewhat similar to those of turn-based RPGs (though the game has no RPG elements): the player chooses commands from a menu, such as attack, use magic, use special technique, use a battle formation, etc. There is no active movement during the battles. The outcome of the battle depends on the chosen commands as well as on the strength of the units.</desc>
	<path>./Zero Wing (Japan).md</path>
	<desc>Zero Wing is an horizontal shooter game where the player is in control of a ZIG, an escape pod released after its main ship was attacked and destroyed by the evil cyborg CATS, bent on taking over the world.

Like most games in the genre, there are three color-coded weapons: red (scatter), green (homing) and blue (lasers). Each weapon has three levels of power, and to obtain those, similar upgrades must be collected sequentially. However, what makes the game unique is the ability to use a traction beam to trap an enemy and then throw him against his peers, destroying them.

The game (or the European PAL version) is best known for being the origin of the infamous "All Your Base" 2001 Internet meme.</desc>

	<desc>16t is a scrolling platform action game similar to Teddy Boy, in which the player controls a youngster in prison garb named Apple Gaikichi, who must eliminate all the enemies on each stage. Apple's only method of attack is throwing enormous 16 ton weights (thus the title), which can and will crush enemies in a bloody mess. However, these weights will bounce off each other, so the player must be careful to not let Apple get crushed himself. They are also not entirely unlimited, as the player can only hold five at once, and they must be allowed to recharge when Apple runs out. Enemies on each stage will appear from the top of the screen in waves, through a randomly cycling "slots" meter, and once all slots and enemies have been cleared, the player moves on to the next stage.</desc>

During the day, the titular "A-Train" can be controlled, by which the player can build tracks and stations. During the night, train schedules can be modified. As the player builds, development will spring up around the tracks and stations, bringing in income by which more tracks and stations can be built.

The game offers a total of five different scenarios of increasing difficulty, ranging from a practice scenario for beginners to very difficult scenarios for experienced players. There are also three different game speed settings available.</desc>

At your disposal is a vulcan cannon (basically a machine gun) and a limited number of missiles. In some versions of the game the guns fire automatically all the time. Sometimes you come across a friendly supply plane and if you dock with it you can replenish your missiles.

The game is viewed from behind the plane with you fighting wave after wave of enemy fighters. But at heart it offers the usual shooter mechanics, meaning you spend most of your time dodging and shooting. You also can speed up and slow down to deal with enemies which appear behind you.</desc>
	<path>./Aladdin (Japan).sg</path>
	<desc>The game from Virgin based on the 1992 animated Disney film is a side-scrolling platformer.

	<path>./Alisia Dragoon (Japan).sg</path>
	<desc>Alisia Dragoon is the female protagonist of this fast-paced platform game. Alisia must destroy an evil demon and avenge her fathers death through eight stages. She has only one weapon to dispose of enemies: thunder magic. This magic is auto-aiming and can track multiple targets. However, the game is quite hard as the levels are loaded with fantasy-inspired monsters. Using thunder magic reduces a magic gauge, meaning you often have to wait for it to recharge. Once fully charged Alisia can unleash a massive rolling blast of lightning across the screen.

During the game, you can improve your magic by picking up potions. There are also four monsters which accompany Alisia: Dragon Frye, Ball O'Fire, Thunder Raven and Boomerang Lizard. Each has different abilities, deciding which, if any, to use in a given situation is part of the challenge. These monsters, like Alisia herself, are fully upgradeable with power-ups. They can also die if weakened too much, forcing you to hunt for a reviving power-up. You can pause the game and select your companion at any time.</desc>

"Devilish" is different from other paddle games by letting you play with two paddles. The lower one behaves just like a usual paddle - you use it to prevent the ball from dropping down. The upper one can move and turn, allowing you to hit the ball from different angles and from different parts of the screen. You advance through levels by destroying bricks and enemies, going up until the level boss enemy appears.</desc>

	<path>./Bare Knuckle - Ikari no Tetsuken - Streets of Rage (World) (Rev A).sg</path>
	<desc>Streets of Rage, Sega's answer to Final Fight, follows the story of three young police officers (Adam Hunter, Axel Stone and Blaze Fielding) in a city controlled by a criminal syndicate led by a "Mr. X" where crime is rampant, which leads the three heroes to make a pact to leave the force and topple the syndicate by themselves.

Gameplay is straightforward and simple. Three buttons are used, one to jump, other to attack and another to perform a range attack from a support police car. Each character has a limited set of moves that include punching and kicking or performing a back attack (if in the open), two grapple moves (depending if holding the opponent in front or by the back), a flying attack, and if playing with another player two additional tag attacks, and different abilities: Adam is slow, but a good jumper and a hard hitter, Axel fast and also a hard hitter, but a lousy jumper and Blaze fast and a good jumper, but weak hitter.
Levels are in typical arcade side-scroller fashion: move from left to right (with two exceptions), clearing screens from enemies one after another as fast as possible while avoid taking damage with a boss in the end. Some levels feature "death drops" where the player must avoid falling, while throwing enemies there at the same time, including a typical elevator level. Several items are scattered on the ground, from melee weapons and bonus points (and lives or additional police cars) to apples and turkeys (to restore health).</desc>
	<path>./Bare Knuckle II (Japan).sg</path>
	<desc>After Axel Stone, Blaze Fielding and Adam Hunter destroyed the evil Syndicate leader, Mr. X, the city became a peaceful place to live, and each one of them followed their own paths. One year later, after their reunion, Adam's brother Sammy returned from school to find their apartment in a mess, and Adam nowhere to be seen, and after calling his two friends, one of them notices a photo of Adam chained to a wall, next to someone they knew very well - Mr. X, who returned to turn the peaceful city once again into a war zone. Now, Axel, Blaze, Sammy, and Axel's good friend Max, a pro wrestler, must head out to stop Mr. X once again...hopefully for good...

Streets of Rage 2 differs from the previous title in several ways. There are changes in both graphics (characters now are bigger, more detailed and with more animation frames, and scenarios are less grainy) and gameplay (the rocket move was replaced by a special move that doubles in offense and defense along several new moves), along other new features such as life bars (and names) for all enemies and the radically different new characters.</desc>
	<path>./Bare Knuckle III (Japan).sg</path>
	<desc>In part three of the Streets of Rage series, Mr. X is back and this time his plan involves replacing public officials with his own robots. Only Axel, Blaze, Skate, and new-comer Dr. Zan can stop him. Streets of Rage 3 features all of the beat 'em up action you would expect from a Streets of Rage game. One new feature is the special move power bar, where it only costs energy to do a special move if the bar isn't full. Also new is the ability to do special maneuvers with different weapons, depending on the character. For example, Skate has no special move with the pipe, but does have one with the knife. The opposite is true for Axel. Any weapon Dr. Zan picks up is turned into energy balls which he can throw at the enemies. Secret characters and multiple endings add replay value.</desc>
	<path>./Batman (Japan).sg</path>
	<desc>The Genesis version of Batman: The Video Game follows closely the plot from the 1989 movie.

The game consists in six stages, four of side-scrolling platform action and two side-scrolling shooter ones, in the following order: Gotham City Street, Axis Chemical Factory, Flugelheim Museum, Gotham City Street (with the Batmobile and after that on foot), In the Sky over Gotham City (with the Batwing) and the Cathedral, where Batman finally faces the Joker.

Batman can beat his enemies by punching them, slide kicking (by pressing down and the B button) or throwing his Batarang. By holding down the B button, Batman will block projectile-based attacks. He can also use his double jump (pressing the C button a second time while ascending) to leap greater distances or attack his enemies. To reach higher platforms, Batman can use his Grappling Hook (by pressing up and C to shoot, C again to climb). While piloting the Batmobile or the Batwing, Batman can shoot the Twin Vulcan Cannons (B button) or Twin Homing Missiles (A button).

Through the levels, Batman will collect Batman emblems (which will give him Batarangs or Twin Homing Missiles, depending on the stage played), Hearts (which give him health) and Batman heads (which give him an extra life).

	<desc>Gil Hazard, president of the Hazard Foundation, is secretly Professor G, the leader of the evil Dark Hazard organization. He has designs on world domination, and has plans to use the power of golf toward this end; this is the Battle Golfer project. Yui Mizuhara and Ran Ryuzaki are two ordinary high school girls who just so happen to be golf prodigies, and so are prime candidates for the Battle Golfer project. They are abducted by Professor G, but are rescued by a mysterious man before they can be taken under his control. Having escaped, Yui hears about a golf tournament being held by the Hazard Foundation, and suspecting more nefarious plans, she secretly enters the tournament to stop him for good.

Battle Golfer Yui is a unique genre fusion between a golf game and a Japanese-style adventure game. The main adventure mode casts the player as Yui competing in the Hazard Cup tournament. The player can interact with other characters on the course, and will need to defeat several different opponents at match play on oddly-themed courses in order to proceed. The system is quite simple and fast-paced; simply choose a direction, a club, spin, and hit the bar with the right timing to adjust shot power. Each character also has special abilities to help them out, but these are limited in use. There is also a regular golf mode for one or two players, offered as both stroke and match play.</desc>

	<desc>A one on one fighting game seen from an isometric perspective. All beasts or dragons have two basic attacks: a punch and a tail attack, as well as a special attack that can only be performed while a certain icon is displayed. During close combat, pressing the A or C button rapidly will result in a throwing or choking attack. There is no visible health bar, but three icons are displayed at the bottom of the screen. Once a dragon is knocked down for a longer moment, one icon turns red. Once all icons are red, the fight is lost. The battle arena is surrounded by an electric fence, that opponents can be thrown into and which can also be used to initiate jump attacks.

There are two modes of play: Match and Tournament. Match is a single match for one or two players, where several different dragons are available. Tournament sees the player starting out with a week dragon who has to fight increasingly difficult battles and increase his stats (Power, Speed and Stamina). After every other battle, a shop can be visited that offers different items including food that increases Power, Speed or Stamina, Data Disks that contain information on other Dragons and more. After visiting the shop, Dragons can be trained. The training consists of simply selecting an attribute to be increased. At a few points in the game, it is possible to splice the player's Dragon's genes which that of a defeated Opponent to gain different abilities.</desc>

	<desc>In the distant future, mankind has long left the Earth and spread all over the Milky Way. Humans settled down on different planets, sometimes coming into contact with other races, and established a connection between them. The player is a nameless young man who was a mere child when he survived a spaceship crash and had to seek shelter on a new planet. Now he is sixteen, and his parents send him as a foreign student to the planet Terra. That is where his adventure begins!

	<path>./Boogie Woogie Bowling (Japan).sg</path>
	<desc>Championship Bowling is a standard bowling game for one or two players, and the only one available for the Genesis. The player picks one of four different bowlers and the ball they want to use, then heads out to the lanes. The player controls the throw, spin, and power by stopping bars at the right time.

The game includes three different play modes: standard bowling; spare mode, where a handful of pins are placed with the goal being to pick up a spare; and bonus mode, where specific pins are worth different amounts of points. Each mode can be played against either the computer or a friend, and there are three different lane types available. There is also a practice mode for each of the game types.

The Japanese version, Boogie Woogie Bowling, is largely the same but features different, more anime-style characters to play as (including a robot for no explained reason), as well as minor tweaks to the timing for throws.</desc>

	<desc>In this game, you play the role of Hiromo, a blue-haired girl who roams the skies on her trusty red airbike. One day, during a routine patrol, she discovered aliens have attacked the Earth. Of course, it is up to our heroine to go on a solo mission, flying in her airbike around the Earth, fighting regular enemies and bosses, and ultimately saving the planet.

	<path>./Chelnov (Japan).sg</path>
	<desc>One windy day, there was an explosion at a nuclear power station, causing heavy doses of radiation to be poured over many people. One of these people was a young scientist named Chelnov. When he survived the deadly accident, he was possessed with abnormal powers. Having realized this, he decided to act in the cause of justice. He is determined to escape the Eastern Bloc country he called home and run and jump across the world to finish in the US.

What distinguishes Chelnov from other platform games is its use of forced scrolling. This occurs when the screen moves continuously from left to right, forcing players to negotiate the game's many obstacles and enemies without controlling Chelnov's speed of progress. Enemies attack from left, right, above, and below, and Chelnov can switch the direction he's facing to attack enemies that are behind him. Some enemies in the game carry different types of weapons and power-ups, and when they are shot at, the power-ups drop to the ground and can be picked up.</desc>

Arashi o Yobu Enji ("A Kindergartner Called Tempest") is one of many games based on the manga and anime created by Yoshito Usui. In four stages, each made up of five areas, Shin-chan must explore his neighborhood looking for a specific object. He can enter houses to ask people for information, but will often end up simply insulting them. He must also avoid or knock over the other children in the neighborhood, and has various ability cards that he can use to assist him, which might give him a water pistol or refill his health. After finding what he's looking for, Shin-chan will move on to the next area.

Also included is a minigame mode with eight different minigames, such as a bubble-blowing contest, a three-legged race, and a desperate search for clothing before school. The entire game, including the minigames, is filled with dialogue containing the same humor as the source material.

You can take as long as you want and explore as much of the world as possible to complete your ultimate task of marrying Christiana, which will require your fame rating to be quite high anyway. Available at most ports is a trader for cargo, a supply station for your crew's food and water as well as repairs, a shipbuilder, an item store and finally a pub for gaining information, crew and gambling.

All of the game progresses on an overhead-view, by sea you navigate your fleet by direction and can issue additional orders including landing on any piece of land to search for supplies. A variety of hazards live at sea including storms, other ships, seaweed and simply bad winds and currents.</desc>
	<path>./Daikoukai Jidai II (Japan).sg</path>
	<desc>In the first Uncharted Waters game, it was the 15th century and the New World was discovered. Now in New Horizons, it is the early 16th century and the age of exploration and sea trade is underway. Players choose from any one of six adventurers (scenarios), each with their own distinctive but intertwining plot, to embark on a quest of sailing, seamanship and exploration. The six characters are:

1. Joao Franco is the son of Duke Leon Franco, the hero of the first Uncharted Waters game and an influential man in Portugal. His father wants to make him into a strong man and so decides to send him out to sea. Young Joao is tasked with learning the skills of the sailor (he is the only character who starts at level one) and embarking on a quest of discovery; reaching the far east and eventually looking for the secret of Atlantis.

2. Catalina Erantzo is a Spanish naval officer who believes her beloved and her brother were both murdered by the Portuguese armada. Vowing revenge she turns to a life of piracy and soon becomes a red haired scourge of the seas.

3. Pietro Conti is a indebted man, having inherited the financial woes of the Conti family. When the Duchess Franco hires him to spy on her son, he accepts the job and obtains a ship. Pietro hopes to use these resources to seek out valuable treasure and clear up his family's debt.

4. Ernst Von Bohr is a geographer who is teaching classes in Holland. But he yearns to leave the classroom and sail the high seas, living a life of adventure that he has only read about in books. When his friend, Mercator offers to finance his initial voyage in exchange for cartography information about the world, Ernst is given the opportunity to live out his dream.

5. Ali Vezas is a poor orphaned child living in Istanbul and serving others. He dreams of becoming his own master and making his own fortune across foreign lands. A twist of fate aides in providing him with small loans, with which he is able to afford his first ship and sail out with a cargo hold full of goods...

6. Otto Baynes styles himself a Royal Knight of the British Empire, in the service of his majesty the king. Promoted to Admiral of the British fleet, the kingdom is worried about the increased naval power of Spanish fleets. Otto is given a letter of marque by the king and ordered to terrorize the Spanish Fleet. Equipping himself simply at first, Otto strives to become a great Privateer in the name of King and Country.

Regardless of the character chosen, Uncharted Waters: New Horizons is a top-down sailing simulation. At sea, players control the direction of their ship, where speed is affected by the number/health of the crew, the wind and the currents. Players can navigate anywhere there is water (though some ships are not ocean worthy) and discover interesting landmarks and new ports. Upon landing at a port, the view is also top-down and the player can enter different buildings, each with unique services and goods. These include: The Inn, the Item Shop, The Shipyard, The Tavern, The Castle, The Guild Hall, The Church, The Merchant and the Harbor. It's up to the player to earn enough gold to keep the crew fed and financed and keep the fleet repaired. Primary methods of earning money are through sea trade, accepting jobs from the guild, gambling and battle with other ships.

During naval combat, the game becomes a turn-based top-down strategy game, with the player moving ships in order to obtain trajectories needed to fire cannons at enemy ships, or run alongside enemy vessels in order to board them. If the player's flagship attacks the flagship of the enemy fleet, they can challenge the opponent to a duel. If accepted, the game changes to a side-view of the two captains engaged in a fight. During this sequence, the player can only choose which fighting maneuver (strike, thrust, parry, lash) they wish to engage in.

The Dragons must now embark on a mission to avenge her death and defeat the Black Warriors for the second and final time.

The original arcade version of "Double Dragon II" was essentially an improved version of the first game. In addition to offering renewed audio and visuals, as well as new traps, moves and enemy characters, "Double Dragon II" discarded the conventional punch and kick buttons in favor of a direction-oriented attacking system similar to the original Technos beat-em-up Renegade.

The NES version offered new stages, new moves and illustrated cut-scenes, as well as a new final boss and a new ending. Unlike the first NES game, it offered 2-Player Co-Op gameplay with the option to turn off the friendly fire.

The Game Boy version of "Double Dragon II" is an English localization of a "Kunio-kun" game (the Japanese franchise which inspired "Renegade" and "River City Ransom" and has nothing to do with the arcade and NES versions.

	<path>./Dragon Ball Z - Buyuu Retsuden (Japan).sg</path>
	<desc>Dragon Ball Z: L'Appel Du Destin is a fighting game that maintains the dual screen mode previously seen in the DBZ Super Butouden series of the SNES, which allowed you to be far from the opponent yet still be able to see him by having the screen split between the two characters. This is important to note, as the most damaging attack of the game could be just executed from far away of your opponent, the energy fireball projectiles. These special attacks also need that you have your KI bar (which unlike energy one, is rechargeable) to a considerable level and the only way to block them is by means of a long button combination.

The constitution of the characters is based strictly on the Freezer and Cell sagas (Son Goku SSJ, Son Gohan SSJ2, Piccolo, Vegeta SSJ, Future Trunks SSJ, Krilin, Recoome, Ginyu, Freezer, A-18 and Perfect Cell), with special mention to Krilin, Ginyu and Recoome, who made here their first appearance in a fighting game. There are also 9 scenarios available, all of them corresponding to recognizable areas of the anime itself, some also appearing for 2 times but in different status (ie, "normal" Namek and Namek "in flames").

Indeed, you can do pretty much everything a typical dolphin does, including eating fish, surfacing in order to breathe, using your biological sonar and of course, jumping out of the water to amaze your friends.

The storyline is actually deeper that one may think by looking at the box illustration. As Ecco, you are the only dolphin who managed to escape from a giant whirlpool which sucked down your entire pod. The five shining stars on your forehead show that you are the chosen one to save them. But that task will be not be an easy one, as you will have to travel through time and space with the Atlantean time machine, and meet the mystical Asterite in order to defeat the Vortex Queen.</desc>

	<desc>Ranger X was released fairly late in the lifetime of the megadrive. Coming from an unknown developer it was released with little fanfare and advertising but has become one of the best demonstrations of what the genesis/megadrive is capable of.

The game is a side scrolling shooter of sorts. You control a large mech (robot) which has a smaller side-kick mech which is a bit like a car. The two can join together providing an alternate shooting mode. Whilst controlling just the main mech however, the player can shoot both forward and back by using different buttons. The mech can also use it's rocket pack to boost off of the ground and hover for a short while. Levels are not necessarily left to right moving (although for the most part they are) and the game is an interesting blend of platform game and shoot-em-up.

The game features innovative graphics given the hardware limitations - there is a 3D introduction to most levels (remembering that the console had no 3D capability and a tile-based renderer) and some levels use a line-based scrolling effect to give the impression of 3D backgrounds.</desc>

The game doesn't have an official FIA license, but much like Human's Fire Pro Wrestling series, includes a number of recognizable fictionalized drivers, such as Ayrton Sesna and Satoru Inakajima. The game includes a world championship mode, where the player must start from the lowest rankings and win races to become the F1 world champion. There is also a battle mode where one or two players can race each other or against computer opponents, as well as a test run mode where the player can learn each course and try to set course records. There are a total of 16 different courses, which can be played in either dry, wet, or half-wet conditions, as well as a wide variety of vehicle settings that can be tweaked.</desc>
	<path>./Fatman (Japan).sg</path>
	<desc>An eclectic, intriguing fighting game. Choose from different alien races (including Human) with different abilities and fighting styles, purchase weapons and devices, and fight your way through multiple opponents to face the Fatman.  Some of the more innovative features include being able to place wagers on the outcome of the fight, and the phenominon of a special move being less powerful the more you use it to balance gameplay.

2 player, head-to-head combat is supported.</desc>
	<path>./Final Blow (Japan).sg</path>
	<desc>Final Blow is an action game based around the sport of boxing. You can play the fighters in a sequence of knock-out competitions, (the computer versions also include a round-robin league). Rounds last one minute, with a short break in between them. As in the real sport, your aim is to knock your opponent down for 10 seconds, by gradually weakening him with a series of punches. You can block punches, to avoid them inflicting damage onto you. The ring is of a limited size, so players can be cornered, although the referee will intervene to break the boxers up if they become entangled in a stalemate position.

The genesis version is not to be confused with the Master System game of the same name, which is entirely different.</desc>
	<path>./Fire Mustang (Japan).sg</path>
	<desc>Fire Mustang is a fast side-scrolling shooter set during World War II. The player controls a P-51D Mustang plane through different missions, with many enemies on the screen at the same time and a large aircraft as a boss at the end of every mission. The Mustang has an unlimited amount of bullets, but one hit is sufficient to lose a life. There are different power-ups to collect, providing additional fire power and new firing patterns. Regardless of the power-ups, the Mustang shoots forward and drops bombs to the ground at the same time, targeting ground troops. There is a limited amount of forgers, large blasts damaging many enemies at once.</desc>
	<path>./Fire Pro Wrestling Gaiden (J) [c][!].sg</path>
	<desc>Thunder Pro Wrestling Retsuden is a spinoff of Human's popular Fire Pro Wrestling series, and the only title in the series to appear on the Mega Drive. Like the other Fire Pro games, it is an arcade-style wrestling game featuring a roster of fictional wrestlers. The game includes a standard World Championship mode where the player picks a wrestler and fights his way to win the title. There is also an "Exciting" mode in which one or two players can play an exhibition singles or tag match against the computer or each other, an Elimination mode where each player picks a team of five wrestlers, and a "Handicap" mode where one fighter must alone take on a tag team.

	<path>./Flintstone (Japan).sg</path>
	<desc>This is a platform game based on the famous Flintstones series. The game features many original Flintstones characters, such as Fred, Wilma, Barney, and others. Instead of the usual "save the princess" or "liberate the world" kinds of a plot, "The Flintstones" is mainly based on small quests: Fred has to retrieve a lost item, etc. The large levels are divided into smaller stages. In the end of each level there is a boss battle. The gameplay involves mostly jumping and hitting the enemies on the heads with a club. The health is measured by hearts. During the game Fred will find many useful items, including some that will increase his health level.</desc>
	<path>./Fushigi no Umi no Nadia (Japan).sg</path>
	<desc>This is one of the several games based on the animé series The Secret of Blue Water. The series (and the game) are loosely based on the stories by the famous French science fiction author Jules Verne. The game is set in 1889, a time of great inventions and technology progress unseen before. You play as Jean, a young genius scientist. In Paris he meets Nadia, an African circus performer. Nadia wears a pendant that contains magical powers, and that is why the evil Gargoyle is after her - this pendant is just the item she needs to build the ultimate weapon, the Tower of Babel. Jean will do anything to protect Nadia, and hope that his love to her, his adventurer spirit, and the power of science will eventually defeat Gargoyle!

Unlike most Japanese adventures, "Fushigi no Umi no Nadia" is a top-down, third-person perspective game, in which you actually move your character around. Nadia and other friends join Jean in a RPG-like fashion (although there is no combat in the game, different characters have their own item-based abilities you should use at certain points). There are no real puzzles in the game, but you'll often have to use your inventory items to make the game progress.

Not to confuse with other Fushigi no Umi no Nadia games (for NES, Turbo CD, etc.)!</desc>

	<desc>Gambler Jiko Chushinha: Katayama Masayuki no Mahjong Dojo is a traditional 4-player mahjong game based on the manga by Masayuki Katayama, one of many produced by Game Arts over the years. The game offers both a free play mode and a lighthearted story mode which follows Katayama's characters, a group of students who play mahjong to settle their differences. There is also a "Mahjong Dojo" mode which quizzes you on aspects of the game in order to help you learn how to play better.</desc>

	<path>./Gley Lancer (J).sg</path>
	<desc>A side-scrolling sci-fi shooter, Gleylancer casts you as Lucia, a young pilot in the Space Fleet of starfighters that hijacks the experimental Gleylancer fighter to go explore the outer borders of known space in search of her missing father. Along the way Lucia will have to shoot down dozens of enemies in standard shooter fashion, while avoiding destruction and collecting power-ups that extend her ship's energy, upgrade weapons and gather screen-clearing bombs.

The Gleylancer comes equipped with two hovering satellites that can receive weapon upgrades of their own, and can lock their positions at specific angles to increase your firepower and protect the player from enemy attacks. Features only a single-player campaign with two different endings depending on how the final stages are completed (e.g. if Lucia's father is rescued or not).
</desc>
	<path>./Golden Axe III (Japan).sg</path>
	<desc>This 'Prince of Darkness' has taken away the Golden Axe and put an evil curse over all the warriors. However, one of the heroes has their curse relieved and is sent to set things straight - lift curse off others, defeat the villian and return with the Golden Axe.

The gameplay has been expanded slightly, but is essentially the same hack n' slash as the previous games. New features to the series include new characters, new moves and junction points where you can choose which path to take.</desc>
	<path>./Gunstar Heroes (Japan).sg</path>
	<desc>Chaos has broken out on the planet Gunstar-9!!

Unleash some mad blasting action onto the Colonel's army and don't let him bring GoldenSilver to life!! The fate of Gunstar-9 is in your hands!</desc>
	<path>./Heavy Unit - Mega Drive Special (Japan).sg</path>
	<desc>In an era of frequent alien attacks, the Earth has a unified Government, which relies on a line of cyborgs known as the Heavy Dolls for defense. The greatest of these are known as the Heavy Nova, a title earned by passing a rigorous training regime.

You are taking on the simulated proving grounds, which are split into two styles of alternating action. In the first you must progress (initially purely horizontally, though later with vertical flick-scrolling as well) through a hostile environment of enemies, bombs and traps, gaining points for doing it quickly and with lots of energy left. Initially you can fly and kick as needed.

Once this section is complete, you move on to one-on-one combat of the Street Fighter 2 style. The early foes have far less energy than you begin with. As you progress through the game, you are awarded extra attacking moves, in a manner similar to Brutal: Paws of Fury</desc>
	<path>./High School Soccer - Kunio Kun (J) [!].sg</path>
	<desc/>
	<path>./Hokuto no Ken (Japan).sg</path>
	<desc>Last Battle is a side-scroller and one of the early games available for the Sega Genesis.  Basically, you are the rebel hero who single handed (or footedly) will fight an entire enemies army for freedom of your people.  Standard karate fighter side-scroller fare.</desc>
	<path>./Honoo no Toukyuuji Dodge Danpei (Japan).sg</path>
	<desc>Danpei Ichigeki is a young boy who loves dodgeball. Danpei's father was a famous dodgeball player when he was still alive, and he joins the Dodgeball Club at his elementary school. However, these kids are very serious about their dodgeball, and the road ahead isn't going to be easy for Danpei.

Dodge Danpei is a team dodgeball game, one of several based on the anime and manga created by Tetsuhiro Koshita, which plays strikingly similar to the well-known Super Dodge Ball. Each team has four main players and three support players, and attempts to knock out the opposing team's main members by throwing the ball at them in various ways. Apart from normal throws, the player can also pass to teammates, and execute special power throws which are harder to dodge or catch.

The game includes several different game modes, including the main story mode which follows the story of the anime, as well as one- and two-player exhibition matches. There is also a "league" mode which allows for a tournament of up to six teams, as well as a training mode where the game teaches the basics of how to play the game.</desc>
	<path>./Hybrid Front, The (Japan).sg</path>
	<desc>The Hybrid Front is a turn-based strategy video game, released in Japan (exclusively) for the Mega Drive.

The introduction begins with someone logging into a computer. Then, it shows a revolution that occurred sometime in the 2080s leading into a series of wars and conflict that lead up to the video game's main setting of the 26th century. Since the second half of the 21st century, the depletion of fossil fuel resources have helped to deepen the conflict on Earth...
During the 24th century, the Earth was bombarded from orbit with massive optical weapons called the Metal Hammer by an Italian consortium; major cities around the world were burned to toast. The resistance would eventually be put down by CoCoON (abbreviation for COoperation COmmunity of Orbital Negotiation). Not only they would gain the corporate hegemony of humanity, CoCoON would develop a reputation as a hostile group of corporate war hawks; constantly revolting against the peaceful coalition of the PETO (abbreviation for Pan Earth Treaty Organization).
Let the fight begins !

	<path>./Hyokkori Hyoutanjima (Japan).sg</path>
	<desc>Hyokkori Hyotanjima: Daitoryo o Mezase! ("Aim for the Presidency!") is a sugoroku-style board game for up to four players based on the popular NHK children's show Hyokkori Hyotanjima. Four characters from the show all decide they want to be the island's president, and so they set off to start campaigning.

The goal of each round is to collect the most points; points can be earned or lost based on the spaces the player lands on. The round ends when a player reaches the destination set at the start of the round, which gives a points bonus. The player with the most points after a set number of rounds is the winner.
</desc>
	<path>./Hyper Marbles (SN) (Japan).sg</path>
	<desc>In the future, even the simple kids game of marbles is high-tech and extreme. Hyper Marbles takes the basic concept of the classic kids game -- to knock the opponent's marbles out of the playfield -- and gives it a futuristic sci-fi twist. The player directs their robotic marble around the field, attempting to push their opponents into the deadly electrified walls lining the arena. Aiding in this is a jet booster, which can cause opponents to bounce quite far, but if overused will overheat and must cool down before being used again. There are ten different arenas, each with different hazards like oil slicks and moving barriers. There is a single player mode, where the goal is to destroy all enemies to move on, as well as a two-player versus mode where the goal is to destroy the other player.</desc>
	<path>./I Love Mickey &amp; Donald - Fushigi na Magic Box (Japan).sg</path>
	<desc>World of Illusion is sort of a follow-up to Castle of Illusion. Mickey Mouse and Donald Duck are taken to a magic world and have to get back home. In order to do that, they can play magical tricks and interact to each other in a 2-player mode. Like other Disney games for SEGA consoles of the same period, the game has cartoon-like graphics and is played as a side-scrolling platformer.</desc>
	<path>./I Love Mickey Mouse - Fushigi no Oshiro Dai Bouken (Japan).sg</path>
	<desc>This is the first Mickey Mouse game for Sega consoles. In this game the famous Disney character must face the dangers of weird fantasy lands such as an enchanted forest and a toy world. Mickey must rescue his girlfriend Minnie who's been kidnapped by the evil witch Mizrabel.

The game play follows the traditional 2D hop 'n' bop platform style in both 8-bit and 16-bit versions. Apart from the story and the music, which is the same, all the rest (including controls, moves, stages and, obviously, graphics), are totally different.</desc>
	<path>./Ichidant R (Japan).sg</path>
	<desc>Ichidant-R is the second game in the Puzzle &amp; Action series, and the sequel to Tant-R. Twenty new minigames are present, including rocketship assembly, a batting contest, and hitting the brakes on a speeding car.

The game once again includes an arcade mode for one or two players. This time, the player is questing to rescue a kidnapped princess from an evil knight. There is also a quest mode which plays like a simple RPG, where battles are fought via minigames. Of course, the four-player competition and free modes also make a return, rounding out the package.</desc>
	<path>./J. League Champion Soccer (Japan).sg</path>
	<desc>European Club Soccer has dozens of teams from all across Europe (around 170), and each country is represented by at least two teams. In addition to correct club names, it also has recognizable imitations of team badges and kits; although more elaborate kits (such as those worn by Juventus, FC Porto or Celtic F.C.) are simplified (Juventus have a silver shirt, Porto blue and Celtic green). Player names, on the other hand, were made by mixing names found on real squads. Portuguese teams, for instance, had a large number of Yugoslavian players in the early 1990s, and that was reflected by players with names such as Valentim Ivic (of Valentim Loureiro and Tomislav Ivic, then Boavista FC chairman and S.L. Benfica manager, respectively). Names could not be changed, and since the game lacked a battery, it does not store changes done to kits and passwords were used to resume tournaments (example of a password sheet). Rotherham United are included amongst the English clubs despite never playing in the top tier of English football, this is due to the developer, Krisalis Software, being based in Rotherham. All other clubs have played in their own country's top tier.</desc>
	<path>./J. League Pro Striker - Perfect Edition (Japan).sg</path>
	<desc>Pro Striker Perfect is an updated version of the original release that features updated player statistics and the addition of the 1993 East and West All-Star teams. It is otherwise identical to the original release.

	<path>./J. League Pro Striker (Japan).sg</path>
	<desc>Pro Striker is the first title in Sega's early-'90s soccer franchise. It is an arcade-style soccer game similar in play to Sega's earlier World Championship Soccer. The game is viewed from a birds-eye perspective with a full field minimap on the side of the screen. The player can also make substitutions and choose from six different formations. It features an official J.Leauge license, including all ten teams and all players from the 1993 season. There is an exhibition mode, a playoff mode, and a full league mode, and up to four players can play simultaneously.
</desc>
	<path>./J. League Pro Striker 2 (Japan).sg</path>
	<desc>Pro Striker 2 is the sequel to the first title, and is a very similar soccer game to the previous year's model. The updates are largely cosmetic, with the game retaining the same top-down view and field minimap. Of course, the full 1994 J.League team and player roster is included. The exhibition, playoff, and league modes are back from the first game, as well as the all-star mode that was added in its update. Once again, up to four players can play simultaneously, and the menu system has also been greatly streamlined.

	<path>./J. League Pro Striker Final Stage (Japan).sg</path>
	<desc>Pro Striker: Final Stage is the last title in Sega's 16-bit soccer franchise, and once again features a full J.League license, including all teams and players, and four-player simultaneous play. This entry in the franchise features a completely new game engine with a side view, rather than the aging overhead engine used previously. Each mode from the previous title has returned: exhibition, tournament, league, and all-star modes are available. There is also a new penalty kick contest mode.

	<path>./Jantei Monogatari (Japan).sg</path>
	<desc>A daughter of the chair of a local high school, Yu Honjo, has been kidnapped by someone unknown. Unable to go to the police, the girl's sister, Mai, hires a private investigator to find out what happened to her. The only piece of evidence is a photograph from the night of Yu's disappearance, where the missing girl and three other students from the same school are playing a game of mahjong.

Jantei Monogatari is a hybrid of a traditional-style Japanese adventure game and a regular mahjong game. The player takes the role of the unnamed private investigator, and moves from place to place via menus, talking to different characters. The investigation happens through playing mahjong with each suspect: win and they'll tell you a bit more of what they know. At first, the investigator can only speak with the three girls in the photo, but as he wins games of mahjong against them, he gains information and experience that allow him to find new clues and talk to more suspects. The investigator will need to play against a dozen different opponents in his attempt to find out what happened to the kidnapped girl.</desc>
	<path>./JuJu Densetsu (Japan).sg</path>
	<desc>The hero of the game is a young jungle-man named Toki. One day the evil wizard Dr. Stark kidnaps his girlfriend Wanda. When Toki tries to save her, he is turned into a monkey! Now Toki has to find Dr. Stark in his palace, to rescue Wanda, and to become a human being again!

It is a platform game with a lot of various levels: jungle, underwater, volcanic caves, on the ice... Toki's only weapons are spitting on the enemies or jumping on them and crashing them. There are many possibilities to upgrade his spitting "weapon"; for example, if he finds an upgrade, he can spit fireballs. 

This game is ported from an older arcade version.</desc>
	<path>./Jurassic Park (Japan).sg</path>
	<desc>The Sega Genesis game based on the Jurassic Park movie/book differs from the games made by Ocean for other platforms. Basically, Sega's Jurassic Park is a side-scrolling action game.  You jump from platform to platform, pick up weapons and health items, and try to make it to the end of the level with all your lives intact.

This version of Jurassic Park does feature an interesting twist, however. You can play it either as Dr. Grant, or as a Velociraptor. The story and level design changes based on which character you use.</desc>
	<path>./Juuouki (Japan).sg</path>
	<desc>In this coin-op conversion, you are a hero raised from the dead by the god Zeus to rescue his daughter Athena. With a scenery inspired by Ancient Greece, you have to fight hordes of undead and demons, with a boss at the end of each level until you meet the god Neff, who holds the girl captive.

The title refers to your shapeshifting abilities. In this platformer, you can collect spirit balls by defeating two-headed wolves, allowing you to mutate into different beasts such as a werewolf, a dragon, a tiger, a bear and others depending on the version. Each form, tied to a level, comes with special abilities such as flight and powerful attacks, easily superseding the basic set of punches and kicks in your human form.

The game can be played in singleplayer mode, or in same-screen multiplayer co-op mode.</desc>

To master the game, one must alternate training and fights, as training improves stamina, strength and resistance.
Be careful, loosing a fight reduces those parameters, so you have to be ready before getting on the ring !

	<path>./Killing Game Show, The (Japan).sg</path>
	<desc>This is a vertical platformer with horizontal wrap-around. For the entertainment of the futuristic masses, you play a criminal that has been inserted into a mechanical body with the promise that if you succeed in surviving through all the levels (there are many and they are hard), you will be set free.
You start each level at the bottom, near pooling liquid which will soon rise, at your immediate peril. Navigate the level from bottom to the exit at the top before the liquid rises and kills you. There are many other foes that fly around, causing you damage and basically annoying you to spit.
Most levels must be navigated through a series of keyed gates, doors, or portals. These shaped keys are scattered around the map and must by picked up and used only on the gates they match individually.
Twist: You can only carry one special weapon (triple shot, laser beam, or vertical shot) and one tool (key, liquid-freeze, or a red herring) at a time.
This game requires a lot of memorization of enemy movement patterns and optimum routes.
A unique feature is that when you die, you can watch a replay and take over at any point to continue your game.
You can also hit the HELP button at the start of each level to view a map, helping you plan your route.</desc>

Gone is the benevolent kingdom of Baltia, and a new power has risen - the Rayguard Empire, led by Emperor Bernhart and his four generals. Recently, Bernhart ordered his army to attack the neighboring countries, obviously searching for something. This "something" might be none else but a legendary evil sword, that makes the one who wields undefeated. It is up to the noble knight Elwin and his friends to stop the Emperor!

"Langrisser II" is a strategy RPG. The army is divided into soldier units and generals, who fight alone and who are usually stronger than a whole unit. Before the scenario begins, you must hire soldiers, buy weapons and items, etc. During the battle, if you come into contact with an enemy unit, an automatic battle sequence occurs. You can also cast healing spells on your units or offensive spells to hurt the enemy.

The major difference between "Langrisser II" and its "remake", Der Langrisser for SNES, is the absence of branching storyline in Genesis release.</desc>

	<desc>From NCS (the makers of Assault Suit Leynos, Assault Suit Valken, Gynoug, and Shubibinman) comes Mamono Hunter Yoko: Dai 7 no Keisho (or Devil Hunter Yoko: The Seven Bells), one of the only games based on the anime/manga devil slayer of the same name. Devil Hunter Yoko is about Yoko Mano, who was a regular girl making her way through high school--until she learned that she is the 108th successor to a line of warriors charged with defending the earth against demons. 

Every woman born into the Mano family has taken up the role of the legendary Devil Hunters, warriors who battle demons and other forces of darkness who threaten Earth. The realm of the demons (which is parallel to our world) is in cross-dimensional alignment with our own, which could cause a portal to open, allowing the demons to cross over, and launch an all-out attack. The demons are trying to destroy Yoko before she can take her rightful place as the 108th generation Devil Hunter. She must stop the demons before they can perform the ritual that will mean the end of the human race.

Mamono Hunter Yoko: Dai 7 no Keisho is a side scrolling action/platformer game along the lines of Valis. You control Yoko who is equipped with a sword, which you use to slash your enemies. Also if you hold the attack button you can create a shield which will block weak attacks. The shield can also then be thrown to attack enemies. You play through various different worlds, such as a plant type stage, a water stage, a cave stage, a snow stage, etc.

Scientists create a computer to leave a seed and restore humanity, a computer known simply as "N", which is part of the top-secret Project Yukiwo. What is Project Yukiwo? None who know remain...

Master of Weapon is a vertically-scrolling shooter based on the 1990 Taito arcade game. The player controls the fighter ship "N", shooting various biological enemies. Powerups are sparse, with only a handful of upgrades available from item pods. The player can fire in the air, as well as towards the ground to hit land-based enemies.

He sends his adoptive son to visit the king of the country, to follow the way of the warrior - and perhaps to discover his true origins...

This is a traditional Japanese RPG set in a medieval environment, with randomly appearing enemies whom you fight in turn-based style, viewing the battle field from first-person perspective. During your journey through the country you'll meet other characters who will join your party. There is a night/day cycle in the game.

	<path>./Megapanel (Japan).sg</path>
	<desc>Megapanel is a tile-based puzzle game that plays like a mixture of Tetris Attack and a traditional sliding tile puzzle. Blocks rise from the bottom of a well, and the player must slide them around in order to create a row or column of three same-color blocks. This causes the group to clear, and potentially create chains from the blocks above falling. As the game continues, the number of blocks that must be cleared to continue as well as the speed at which the stack rises will both increase.

The game includes three modes. First is training mode which explains the basics of the game. In this mode, a certain number of blocks must be cleared to complete the stage. Second is a "pin-up" mode for one player, where clearing blocks reveals parts of an image of a cute anime girl, the goal being to uncover the entire picture. Last is a two-player versus mode, where players compete to clear their blocks the fastest, and can send garbage blocks to their opponent and fill up their field. The game includes two difficulty settings, two versus modes, a sound test, and a unique mode that displays the entire game in sepia tone.</desc>

	<path>./Metal Fangs (Japan).sg</path>
	<desc>Metal Fangs is a unique futuristic battle driving game, where the player controls a team of racers and must attempt to destroy the competing team. Each "race" is made up of two heats of two parts each, and hits or kills on the other team earns points. During each heat, each team takes one turn attacking (four vehicles on the course) and one turn defending (three vehicles on the course). The team with the most points at the end of the last heat wins a reward and moves on to the next match.

However, your team won't get very far with just its basic equipment. After choosing your team's colors and members, you must then purchase upgrades for each person: engines, fuel, AI, armor, and of course weapons. During the game, you can switch freely between each member of your team. Your vehicle automatically moves forward around the track, but you can turn, throttle, and brake in order to move closer to or escape from the other team.

After each successful match there is a game of chance where winnings can be increased. There is also a two-player simultaneous battle mode.</desc>

His girlfriend Traysia gives him a pendant, to remind him of her... will Roy be able to escape from all the dangers that await him on his long journey and to see Traysia again?

The game is a party-based RPG with randomly encountered enemies. The combat is somewhat similar to early Ultima games. When an enemy appears, you enter a battle screen on which your party is positioned in the lower part, the enemies in the upper part. You can attack if you are close enough to the enemy, otherwise you'll just move towards him. Magic spells should be cast to an appropriate direction to hurt the enemy.</desc>
	<path>./Monster World IV (Japan).sg</path>
	<desc>This is a sequel to Wonder Boy 5: Monster World 3. You control Asha, the green-haired girlfriend of Shion, the hero of the previous game. One day, Asha was standing on a cliff near her home village, and suddenly heard a mysterious voice calling for help. She decided to leave the village and to embark on an adventure to discover the identity of this mysterious person.

Monster World 4 is essentially a platform game, with slight RPG/adventure elements (puzzles, treasure, equipment, etc.) Asha can jump, run, attack or defend (by pressing the "down" button). She can also use items and equip weapons and armor, talk to people, and open treasure chests. Later in the game, she will also be able to use magic, and a little blue pet animal will assist and help her on her journey. The combat system is very similar to the classical Zelda style. Health and mana points are measured in little hearts, and the more you progress in the game, the more hit points you gain.

The game was released only in Japan. It is sometimes erroneously called "Wonder Boy 6".</desc>

	<path>./Mutant League Football (Japan).sg</path>
	<desc>Futuristic, intergalactic war disguised as American Football, Mutant League Football was one of the most unique football games ever to hit the gaming market. It's a unique blend of sports and sci-fi, and the actual football is the good ol' smash-mouth kind, literally.

Dynamite throwing running backs, blitzing trolls, robots that bleed oil, it's all here. Opposing quarterback connecting on too many passes? Blitz him 'til he's dead. Suspect the ref's been bribed by the other side? Call a Kill Ref audible; it's a 5 yard penalty though. 

Take your pick from nineteen teams, including three All-Star teams. There are five difficulty levels and a slow/fast game speed toggle. A tournament mode awaits those who want something more than a quick game versus the computer or a friend.

There are nineteen different fields to play on, all with there own special quirks. The Hellfield is littered with mines and fire pits to put an end to a careless runner, while The Pen is a slippery sheet of ice.</desc>

	<desc>One day, a kiwi tribe was having fun and games outside the zoo, only to be kidnapped by the evil-minded Leopard Seal, who plans to sell them at the black market. Fortunately, during the kidnapping process, Tiki, leader of the tribe, managed to escape the sack, and her job is to rescue Phee-Phee and the other kiwis scattered around New Zealand, and are held in cages in various locations that include Auckland, Rotorua, Waitomo Caves, Strait Cook, and Mt. Cook. 

If Tiki doesn't rescue a kiwi in a limited amount of time, the devil will appear and try to kill her. When Tiki reaches the outskirts of each city, except Strait Cook, there is a boss waiting to meet Tiki, and kill her by using their own choice of weapons. Also making the rescue mission difficult are several nasties that attempt to throw their own weapons, like bombs and arrows, at her. To defeat these enemies, Tiki shoots at them using her crossbow and arrows. More often than not, when Tiki shoots at enemies, they will leave behind pieces of fruit that she can pick up for points. However, it is likely that Tiki may get other weapons or the letters E, X, T, E, N, and D. Collecting all these letters will result in an extra life, and as for the weapons, they include laser shots, bombs, and fireballs. 

In some levels, a few areas are located further up than just left or right, and the only way that Tiki can go up is by snatching something off the enemy that gives her the ability to fly up. Other areas are underwater, and when Tiki goes underwater, her oxygen meter decreases, so she has to rise up to the surface again to restore her oxygen levels. Apart from her own weapons, Tiki is able to squirt water at enemies if she gets to the top of the water.</desc>

	<desc>Ninja Burai Densetsu  is a 1991 strategy game by Sega for the Sega Mega Drive released exclusively in Japan.

The game plays similarly to other strategy games such as SystemSoft's Daisenryaku games and Sega's own Shining games. You are in control of a team of ninjas fighting another team. C selects a ninja/confirms an action. B cancels an action, or if no action is in progress, selects the next ninja. A opens the battle menu, which allows you to end your turn. Battles are fully automatic. Unique to Ninja Burai Densetsu are side-scrolling special stages: should you move a ninja onto a special space, they will go into a town where they can get various helpful items from townsfolk.</desc>

Osomatsu-kun: Hachamecha Gekijo (Nonsense Theater) is a side-scrolling action platformer based on the manga and anime created by Fujio Akatsuka, which plays similarly to Alex Kidd. The player controls the titular Osomatsu through outlandishly Japanese environments, fighting bizarre enemies, collecting ribbons to buy various items from hidden shops, and searching for his missing brothers. Each stage is made up of multiple areas; falling into holes in the ground leads to underground passages, and jumping onto flying shells leads up into the clouds. A boss waits at the end of each stage, usually just Iyami in some sort of strange disguise.

One day, a mysterious evil panda decides he must have it, and steals it for himself, turning it into his own personal pachinko island, a place where anyone who enters can never leave. Chen is a man who loves pachinko, and one day he heads of to the famous pachinko parlors of Yokohama...and never returns. Fortune tells that very soon, the person who will stop the evils of this pachinko parlor will appear, and Chen's daughter, Ren, sets out on her 18th birthday for Yokohama, looking for her father.

Pachinko Kuunyan is a pachinko RPG much like the Pachio-kun series. The player controls Ren as in a standard role-playing game, but rather than fighting battles, she can enter pachinko halls and play the machines. Each of the five cities has several pachinko halls, and Ren must empty out a certain number of machines before she can move on to the next city. If she runs out of balls, then the game is over.</desc>

Cotton agrees under one condition: she will receive some willows as a reward, since willows are her favorite food. Finally, after defeating Wool, Cotton realized that someone poisoned the promised willows, and swears revenge. Accompanied by Silk, she begins to chase the mysterious enemy.

"Panorama Cotton" is a pseudo-3D scrolling shooter reminiscent of Space Harrier, set in an animé-style fantasy world. Various levels scroll "into the screen", vertically, horizontally, or diagonally. You can move Cotton over the screen, shooting at oncoming enemies and avoiding obstacles on her way. Cotton can upgrade her weapon to higher levels as you advance in the game, and can also cast magical spells by collecting special items.</desc>

The game takes the basic template of the 1982 original and expands on it, offering a greater variety of enemies, various environmental hazards, and power-ups, along with of course updated 16-bit graphics and sound. The goal is still to push blocks and crush enemies. Enemies now appear from generators, which must be destroyed to stop new enemies from appearing, and all enemies must then be eliminated to complete each stage.

Unlike most other fighting games, you can control only one character (Joe) in single-player mode. In two-player mode, you can choose to fight as any of the seven available fighters, and also choose a scenery. The game plays like a standard 2D fighter: you can punch, kick, and jump on you opponents, but the fights are not entirely 2D, since you can also take a few steps vertically.</desc>

	<desc>In 21th century, there are three main powers on the Earth. The free world and the communist block carried over from the 20th century; the third power is the New Communist Federation. Since a program of denuclearizing was supported by all those powers, the New Communist Federation developed a devastating non-nuclear weapon: the satellite &amp;quot;Raiden&amp;quot;. The two other powers competed with the New Communist Federation, developing their own killer satellites, and the danger of total annihilation became once again an issue. Seeing no future for the Earth, humans started to colonize other planets. In 22th century, they sent an experimental ship &amp;quot;Septemius 1&amp;quot; to a star six light years far away from the Solar System. The ship's main computer, &amp;quot;Racoon&amp;quot;, sent a strange message before stopping any communication. You are Keith McDonnell, a seventeen-year-old crew member of the ship &amp;quot;Septemius 2&amp;quot; that was sent to investigate the strange disappearance. Will you be able to uncover the mystery?

This is a Japanese adventure in animé style. You interact with the game world by moving a cursor and clicking on objects to examine or use them, and people to talk to them, or by choosing options (&amp;quot;Move&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;Scroll&amp;quot;) from a menu. There are no puzzles to solve; you advance in the game by talking to characters, visiting different locations, and examining and using objects.</desc>

Some of these are the U.Z. canon, cruise missiles, and speed boost. Your car has a very limited amount of fuel, however more can be picked up along the way by crossing the halfway point of a level, or by collecting the red and green fuel spheres that appear in the road or after destroying certain enemies.

	<path>./RoboCop versus The Terminator (Japan).sg</path>
	<desc>The Dark Horse comic book crossover of the two famous 80s cyborgs spawned various different game adaptations. RoboCop versus The Terminator on the Genesis is only loosely based on the comic.

The player controls RoboCop who during his duty of policing the streets of Detroit is lured into a trap by Terminators sent from the future. By uploading himself into the computer network, he becomes the seed from which the malevolent Skynet grows. Years later, in the post-apocalyptic future, RoboCop is reactivated and must help the human resistance by attacking and defeating Skynet once and for all.

The game is a platformer with heavy shooting elements and consists of 10 levels. Many enemies stand in RoboCop's way and must be destroyed via 8 different weapons. RoboCop begins the game with only a basic pistol, but other weapons can be found, including flame and grenade throwers, laser guns, self-seeking missiles and others. While all guns have unlimited ammo, only two can be carried at the same time and being killed means the currently equipped gun is lost.

The game is evenly split between present and future levels. Enemies in present Detroit include mostly street punks and other criminal elements while the future is of course populated by deadly machines: Terminators, robotic dogs and spiders and many automated guns. Each level ends with a boss battle, featuring Terminators, heavy tanks and RoboCop's famous adversaries ED-209 and Cain (aka RoboCop 2).

Some levels feature optional goals besides getting to the exit, like freeing hostages or destroying security cameras.

	<desc>In the early part of the 20th century, a group of evil poachers recklessly hunted animals to the point of extinction, including lions, deers, elephants, eagles, and several others.

Growl is a one-player game, in which you control one of four characters (Gen, Burn, Khan, and Jack) and you must defeat these evil poachers by dealing with them with your fists. However, there are weapons that can be found, including grenades, rocket launchers, whips, swords, guns, and shotguns, which you get once an enemy drops them on the ground, so you can use these weapons against them. If you manage to get one of the guns, you can shoot enemies with a limited supply of ammo. Once the ammo runs out, your only option is to pistol-whip them.

Also, you can pick up crates and barrels and haul it at enemies to knock them down. Along the way, you'll encounter several cases of animal cruelty, such as two men whipping a lion. Stop the animal cruelty, and the animals will help you in your quest to defeat these evil poachers.</desc>

This fighting game is a coin-op conversion of the Neo-Geo hit of the same name, and has all characters, stages, and moves featured in the arcade unit. Unlike the original arcade version, players can now play as Mr. Big and the elusive Mr. Karate.

The gameplay differs from most fighting games. In this game, you have a Spirit meter. A Spirit meter is in the game and will decrease as you perform special moves. It can be recharged, but doing so leaves you open to attack. When your health is almost gone, you can perform a secret combination that will unleash a deadly attack on your opponent - provided you have a full Spirit meter.</desc>
	<path>./Same! Same! Same! (Japan).sg</path>
	<desc>Fire Shark takes place around a small island in the South Pacific.  It is a continuously-scrolling aerial shooter with a top-down view.  Your World War II era biplane has been modified to shoot lasers and drop powerful bombs. 

There are ten levels in the game in which you will face aerial, aquatic, and ground enemies. They all fire scores of missiles at you in an attempt to knock you from the sky. 

In between levels, your plane will land on a runway for refueling and maintenance. You will receive bonus points for the number of bombs left in your hold and the number of lightning bolt icons you picked up in the prior level.

There are also many power-ups available in each level. Slow-moving blimps contain a power-up icon which is revealed after the zeppelin explodes. Other icons appear when various other enemies or buildings are destroyed. These power-ups will float around the screen for several seconds. Grabbing them with your plane earns you a weapon upgrade or bonus points.

The standard weapons are the bomb and the Wide Shot. As power-ups are obtained the number of shots per blast can increase up to 16. The Wide Shot is a comparatively weak weapon that usually requires multiple hits to take an enemy down.

The Shark Beam is a green laser that fires in a spiral pattern and the strongest weapon of all is the Super Fire. It will fire continuously while the fire button is held. Power-ups increase its beam count to 4.</desc>

	<desc>Humans on Earth have lost their righteous ways. After seeing that this has happened, the Gods have decided to abandon the Earthlings and no longer protect them. Ashura, the King of an alien race hailing from the Evil World, decides that this is the perfect time to strike the vulnerable unprotected Earth.  It just so happens that one of the good gods, Hyperion, takes pity on the humans and decides to bestow his power to four of the strongest Earth warriors so they can go and defeat Ashura and his minions.

The player takes control of these four warriors who are Leo, a fencer, Marco, a monk, and Horatio and Tiffany, whom are both ninjas (one male, one female). Each character fires their own type of weapon and each character can charge up their weapon to make it a more powerful shot. All the characters also have a special weapon that can clear all the enemies on the screen but with the caveat that it can only be used once per stage. Each character also has a jump and speed attribute which when powered up allows them to jump higher and walk faster. Players can switch between all of the characters during a stage.

The game has 9 different stages. The player can play the first six (mountain,harbor,street,future,glen, and forest) in any order. Each round ends with a boss which must be defeated to clear that round.</desc>

She happens to be the granddaughter of the head of the dojo, and doesn't want him to get involved with the place, but Tsukumo insists on continuing regardless. He walks right in, and takes on the first guy in a karate gi he comes across...

Shura no Mon is a so-called "command action" game based on the manga by Masatoshi Kawahara. The player controls Tsukumo by selecting commands from a list, using different attacks and defensive maneuvers at the appropriate time, with the results shown via brief animated sequences. Between bouts, lightly-animated visual scenes progress the story. The plot closely follows the first arc from the manga, starting with Tsukumo's arrival at the legendary Jinmukan dojo.</desc>

The basic gameplay is identical: a vertically-scrolling shooter where power-ups cycle through a list to choose from, and it is possible to construct massively-wide ships with incredible firepower. Slap Fight MD also adds the ability to jettison your ship's power-ups causing a massive screen-filling explosion that can potentially save your life.</desc>

Snow Bros. is a fixed-screen platform game where players must defeat all enemies on each level (screen), 50 altogether. The Snow Bros use snow as their weapon, throwing it at the enemies to stun them. When lots of snow is thrown at an enemy, it becomes covered in a flurry and unable to move. These can be rolled into giant snowballs and pushed or kicked into other enemies. If left alone, enemies will eventually defrost and become angry at the player. The enemy filled snowballs are a much stronger weapon then the regular handful of snow and are the only effective weapon Nick and Tom have against the bosses.</desc>

	<desc>Shove It! The Warehouse Game is a top-down puzzle game based on the original gameplay of Soko-Ban Hiroyuki Imabayashi wrote for Thinking Rabbit. The player controls Stevedore, a warehouse keeper, from a top-down view. As shown on the title screen, shoving boxes will earn him money to make his dreams come true, a lovely girlfriend and a fiery red sports car.

The game consists of 16 stages with 10 rounds each. At a certain stage, any of the 10 rounds can be selected while playing but a new stage will only be opened up when all rounds have been successfully completed. To complete a round, Stevedore needs to push all boxes on the designated spots. This will turn them into a different colour. This is no easy task as the level design will obstruct many moves and cornered boxes can no longer be moved. While playing it is possible to restart the round, undo the last step and the game keeps track of the number of steps taken.

The game supports passwords and includes an edit mode where new levels can be designed and played.</desc>

	<path>./Sonic Eraser (Japan).sg</path>
	<desc>Sonic Eraser is a puzzle game very similar to Columns that features Sega mascot Sonic the Hedgehog. Pieces in different arrangements drop into a well; if two or more matching pieces touch, they disappear and the above pieces fall to take their place. There are four different single-player game modes:

1. Round: Each stage starts with pieces in the well already. There are several spinning green pieces, which must all be destroyed to finish the stage.

2. Normal: A standard endless mode in which the game speed continually rises as matches are made.

3. Doubt: No white-colored blocks will appear in the drop formations, but often a random block in the formation will change to a white block after it is placed.

4. Block: Similar to Normal mode, but blocks will not fall out of formation until a match is made, allowing for impressive clear combos.

These modes can be played either single player or two-player simultaneous on separate fields. There is also a versus mode for one or two players, in which creating a combo of three or more clears will attack the opposing player, which causes them to lose control of their pieces for a short time.</desc>

</desc>
	<path>./Sonic the Hedgehog (Japan).sg</path>
	<desc>Sonic the Hedgehog is the first of many games starring Sega's premier rodent, Sonic. It's a side scrolling platform game with a difference: speed. Sonic rushes through levels with incredible speed, allowing him to traverse loops and jumps with ease. 

The plot of the game is simple. The evil Dr. Robotnik has captured many of Sonic's animal friends, and trapped them inside robots. Fortunately, Sonic can free his friends by destroying the robots with his spin attack. Meanwhile, Dr. Robotnik is trying to control the all-powerful chaos emeralds. Sonic must grab them before he does in the 3D rotating bonus levels. 

Sonic's weapon is his spin attack; while jumping, Sonic destroys hostile robots by touch. Throughout the platforming levels, Sonic collects numerous rings. If Sonic is hit by an enemy, all the rings he's carrying fall out and scatter around; Sonic can quickly grab the rings back before they disappear. If Sonic is hit while not carrying any rings, he dies. Collecting 100 rings gives Sonic an extra life. There is also an invincibility bonus which temporarily protects Sonic from all attacks. 

The game is divided into several "zones", each of them containing three levels. At the end of each zone Sonic confronts Dr. Robotnik in a boss fight. 

Sonic the Hedgehog is a significant game because it gave Sega it's first real mascot, and established the Genesis as the video game system with "attitude."</desc>
	<path>./Sonic the Hedgehog 3 (Japan).sg</path>
	<desc>Dr. Robotnik's Death Egg has crash-landed on Floating Island, so called because it harnesses the power of the Chaos Emeralds to float in the air.  Robotnik needs them to repair the Death Egg, so he tells the guardian of Floating Island, Knuckles the Echidna, that Sonic and Tails are there to steal them. With Knuckles tricked and trying to stop the heroes at every turn, will they be able to stop Robotnik in time?

Sonic the Hedgehog 3 is the third in the Sonic series of games. As with the previous games, it is a side-scrolling platformer based around speed. The basic game remains the same - players collect rings to earn extra lives, which are also used for protection, and scatter everywhere when Sonic is hurt. Sonic can jump on enemies to defeat them, and Spin Dash by holding down and the jump button, then letting go of down.

New to Sonic 3 are three different types of shields - the Fire Shield (which protects you from fire but disappears if you enter water), the Water Shield (which lets you breathe underwater infinitely) and the Electric Shield (which pulls nearby rings towards you). Sonic can use extra abilities when he has these shields by pressing jump while in the air - either a horizontal fireball dash, a vertical bubble bounce, or an electric double jump. If Sonic has no shield active, he can activate a brief energy shield, also by pressing jump in the air. Tails cannot use the shields' special abilities, but he can instead either fly or dog paddle (in water) for a limited time. He can also carry Sonic with him while doing so.

There are now two types of bonus stages - one is available by collecting 50 or more rings, running past a checkpoint lamppost and then jumping into the stars (as you could in Sonic the Hedgehog 2. This stage give you the chance to earn bonus rings, lives and power-ups. In this stage, there is a giant gumball machine. By hitting the crank, you'll spit out a bonus item that can either be rings, lives or bonus shields. The stage is over when you fall down the bottom of the screen.

The other, more important, Special Stage can be accessed by jumping into giant rings that are hidden away in secret areas in each level. In these stages, you must collect all the blue spheres while avoiding the red ones (which end the stage early). Collecting all of the outer blue spheres around square or rectangle sphere formations will turn them all into rings - if you collect 50 or more in this stage, you can earn a continue. Once you collect all the blue spheres in the stage, it clears and you earn one of the seven Chaos Emeralds.

Sonic 3 features six different Zones, which are made up of two Acts. At the end of each Act is a boss that must be defeated to complete the stage and rescue Sonic's animal friends that Robotnik has captured to turn into Badnik robots. The zones in Sonic 3 are approximately three times bigger than those in Sonic 2, and feature multiple, branching paths.

As with Sonic 2, there is a two-player Vs. Mode, which plays in a split-screen horizontal style. There are special monitor pick-ups in this mode which do things like swap player positions, lose rings, or cause a Badnik to appear. You can also race against the clock in a time trial mode.</desc>

	<desc>Sorcerer's Kingdom is a mix of RPG and strategy game. You play a young adventurer, who is sent out by the king to find out the reason for the increasing number of monsters that threaten the land and restore peace to the kingdom. Starting out as an Adventurer you are eventually given higher titles by the king, as a reward for completing quests. 

The game plays like a typical RPG but the battles are a little unusual. Whenever you are attacked or attack a monster that is within your current range, a turn-based battle starts immediately without taking you to a separate fighting area, and you have to fight all enemies that were visible the moment the battle started.</desc>
	<path>./Sorcerian (Japan).sg</path>
	<desc>Sorcerian is the fifth game in the Dragon Slayer series. It is set in the fantasy land known as Pentawa, whose inhabitants are in constant need of protection from ferocious creatures roaming the wilderness. The king of Pentawa hires a party of adventurers, and their first assignment is to retrieve a precious sceptre from a dungeon, where it is guarded by the evil demonic lord Ouks.

The game is an RPG with an unusual side-scrolling perspective and action-based combat, somewhat of a cross between Wizardry and platform games. Despite being a Japanese game, Sorcerian resembles Western RPGs of its time, focusing more on character development than story. In the beginning, the player creates a party of four characters, choosing between fighter, wizard, elf, and dwarf (races and classes are not distinguished). Beside the usual inns and shops, there are many things that can be done in the towns of the game, including complex development of magical spells (up to 120 spells of different disciplines), training to raise personal skills (strength, intelligence, etc.), enchanting weapons with elemental magic, as well as looking for part-time jobs.

The view switches to side-scrolling when the party ventures into a hostile area. Combat is performed in real time, with the player controlling the entire party at once. The lead character can be changed at any time, and battle actions will be carried out by whoever is in front. Melee attacks and magic spells are unleashed by pressing corresponding buttons. The characters can also jump and interact with objects by bumping into them. Dungeons are usually maze-like, and some contain simple puzzles such as finding and activating hidden switches to open doors.</desc>

There is also a "doubles" mode, where two players work together to fill lines in an extra-wide well, each controlling their own pieces simultaneously.

	<path>./Time Dominator 1st (Japan).sg</path>
	<desc>A fast-paced platform game in the vein of the classic Sonic the Hedgehog. The evil overlord Time Dominator has constructed a time machine and is using it to steal treasures from the past, creating a warp in the flow of time. The Time Warp Patrol, created to prevent this sort of thing from happening, sends the special time-traveling duck Socket (or Minutes in the Japanese version) to fix the flow of time and stop Time Dominator.

Socket has reasonably basic abilities: he can jump, kick to the side or straight upward, and run quite fast. As Socket is a robot, his energy level continually drains from simply being in operation; thankfully, there are a liberal amount of electric bolts strewn about each stage, which will refill his health when picked up. Getting hit by enemies will take a chunk out of his life bar.

There are seven different themed zones, each with four separate parts. First up is the High Speed Zone, which is a gateway level leading to the next zone, and as the name suggests it encourages high speed play. Next is the Athletic Zone, which generally entails lots of jumping, and the Labyrinth Zone, which is focused on exploration and simply finding a path to the exit. At the end of each Labyrinth Zone, Socket faces off against Time Dominator in a boss round, then moves on to the next High Speed Zone.

The game also features a sound test mode and a time trial mode, where the High Speed Zone stages can be played without any enemies present with times being recorded.</desc>

The game features 9 stages, each with a boss at the end, as well as one or two-player simultaneous play. The game difficulty has been rebalanced from the arcade to compensate for the lack of a trackball to control the aiming cursor; the player must stop their ship in order to move the cursor.

In Grind Stormer the ship always moves at a fast speed and the player can collect bombs that damage the entire screen and fend off bullets. The other variant V Five takes a Gradius-approach to power-ups, having the player advance through a selection of power-ups shown on the right by collecting tokens. In the first mode power-ups are immediately applied. In the second mode the ship is much slower and the player needs to decide to spend tokens on speed power-ups right away or save them to advance to seeking bullets or additional power.

The game difficulty, amount of lives and continues can be set in the options. After using a continue, the player immediately receives a "Special" power-up granting four wingmen.</desc>

Like other Disney games for SEGA consoles of the same period, the game has cartoon-like graphics and is played as a side-scrolling platformer.</desc>

	<desc>In this game you take on the role of 1 out of 8 teams who represent various nations vying to become the Powerball champions. Powerball is a game consisting of a hybrid of sports such as American football, soccer and rugby. You play on an 100 yard field trying to score on the opposing team. Scoring consists of either running into your opponent's end zone holding the powerball for a touchdown or kicking the ball into your opponent's net to score a goal.  Goals are worth 1 point, and touchdowns are worth 3 points. The game modes are 1 or 2 player exhibition play, and 1 or 2 player league play. League play allows you to use bonus points, and distribute them to your teammates to improve their statistics.</desc>

	<desc/>
	<path>./Yuu Yuu Hakusho Gaiden (Japan).sg</path>
	<desc>Based on the manga/animé series Yu Yu Hakusho. This is a story of a teenager delinquent Yuusuke Urameshi, who was hit by a car while trying to save a child. However, there was no place found for him either in paradise or in hell, and Koenma, the son of the death god Enma, sends him back to our world, where he has to be an "occult detective" and to fight against demons. Several characters join him on his quest: Kazuma Kuwabara, his ex-rival and best friend; Kurama, a 1400-year-old demon fox; and Hiei, formerly a demon who tried to conquer the world and had to repent for his sins by helping Yuusuke.

You must play the individual chapters of the four playable characters (Yuusuke, Kuwabara, Kurama, and Hiei), until in the final chapter you control them all in the ultimate confrontation against evil forces. The game is a Japanese-style adventure (no puzzles, menu-driven interface) with the addition of battles. The battles are real time; similarly to fighting games, you can kick, punch, defend, and use special techniques. Unlike most Japanese adventures, you view the game world from platform-like third person perspective (although you cannot move physically in adventure mode).

	<path>./Zan Yasha Enbuden (Japan).sg</path>
	<desc>Zan: Yasha Enbukyoku is a turn-based strategy game set in feudal Japan.

The background for the game's events is the ongoing battle between noble warriors, known as yasha, and demons. Between the two stand the "middle people", i.e. other Japanese generals and rulers. The player can choose to play as either yasha, demonic, or "middle" army. 

The player has to manage his army, deploying units for protection and attack, as well as negotiating with other rulers. Events such as earthquakes, plagues, etc. occur randomly. Diplomacy doesn't always work, so battles against enemy armies occupy a large portion of the game. The battles are somewhat similar to those of turn-based RPGs (though the game has no RPG elements): the player chooses commands from a menu, such as attack, use magic, use special technique, use a battle formation, etc. There is no active movement during the battles. The outcome of the battle depends on the chosen commands as well as on the strength of the units.</desc>
	<path>./Zero Wing (Japan).sg</path>
	<desc>Zero Wing is an horizontal shooter game where the player is in control of a ZIG, an escape pod released after its main ship was attacked and destroyed by the evil cyborg CATS, bent on taking over the world.

Like most games in the genre, there are three color-coded weapons: red (scatter), green (homing) and blue (lasers). Each weapon has three levels of power, and to obtain those, similar upgrades must be collected sequentially. However, what makes the game unique is the ability to use a traction beam to trap an enemy and then throw him against his peers, destroying them.

The game (or the European PAL version) is best known for being the origin of the infamous "All Your Base" 2001 Internet meme.</desc>
