"Cutie Suzuki no Ringside Angel" is a wrestling game in which you can choose to play as one of the nine female wrestlers available. Each girl has her own strengths and weaknesses. There are three modes in the game: you can fight against any of the opponents with the character you have chosen; you can participate in a playoff tournament; and there is an additional "watch" mode in which you can simply watch the fights without participating. Beside the traditional moves, the wrestling style of the girls allows punching the opponents.
