Shura no Mon is a so-called "command action" game based on the manga by Masatoshi Kawahara. The player controls Tsukumo by selecting commands from a list, using different attacks and defensive maneuvers at the appropriate time, with the results shown via brief animated sequences. Between bouts, lightly-animated visual scenes progress the story. The plot closely follows the first arc from the manga, starting with Tsukumo's arrival at the legendary Jinmukan dojo.
