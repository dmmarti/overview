Shogi no Hoshi is a digital version of the ancient Japanese game shogi, which is a board game that plays much like chess. The game is a standard shogi game for one player. There is a standard versus-computer mode with six different play levels, as well as a bizarre Adventure mode which follows a young boy named Kinta whose mother is trying to get him to become the greatest shogi player in Japan.
