Kyuukai Douchuuki  is a 1990 arcade baseball game by Namco which they ported to the Sega Mega Drive in 1991. Neither version left Japan. 
 
The game is a generic baseball game where you are only in control of the pitcher and batter; once the batter hits the ball, you can only watch what your team does. When batting, the D-pad moves around and C swings. When pitching, Left and Right move around and some amount of time holding the C button appears to pitch.
