A dream thief has come and stolen the dreams of all the children, using them to create his own personal paradise where nobody may trespass. The children can't continue on without their dreams, and someone need to save them...that someone being Doraemon, the mechanical blue cat from the future! Finding his friends have lost their color, Doraemon flies into the sky and chases after the dream thief into his world of dreams. 
 
Doraemon: Yume Dorobo to 7-nin no Gozans ("Doraemon: The Dream Thief and the Seven Gozans") is an action platform game based on the popular children's cartoon Doraemon. Doraemon must make his way through each of the seven dreamscapes, stunning enemies with a water pistol, throwing them out of his way, and collecting coins and stars. He can run and jump, and even flail his arms to extend the reach of his jumps.
