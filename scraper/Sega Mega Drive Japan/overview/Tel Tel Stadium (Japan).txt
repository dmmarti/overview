Tel-Tel Stadium is a baseball game with generic Japanese teams. The main draw of this particular version is online play through a phone line, but this service has long since been discontinued. Unlike many baseball games, Tel-Tel Stadium takes a rather hands-off approach to the action, allowing the player to give commands to the batter, pitcher, and fielders rather than directly controlling them. In addition to the now-defunct online mode, it can be played single-player offline with an exhibition match, as well as a "pennant mode" where the player builds their own team and plays through a full season. There is also the option to watch a computer-controlled match.
