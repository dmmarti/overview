Rolo to the Rescue is a classic platformer.   
 
You play the role of Rolo the elephant who escaped from the circus. As you find your way through the world you will also find a squirrel, a rabbit, a beaver, and a mole. Each of those friends have special abilities that can help you along the way -- the squirrel can climb, the rabbit jumps, the beaver swims, and the mole digs. 
 
Eventually, Rolo will find his way home.
