It's vacation time for Maruko and her friends. Hanawa, the ladies' man with rich parents, invites Maruko and Tamae to an island down south to relax, and rounding out the group, Maruo butts in and comes along as well. Since they're going to get souvenirs and such while they're there, they decide to make a game of it and see who is best at shopping! 
 
Waku Waku Shopping is a sugoroku-style board game based on the popular characters created by Momoko Sakura. The game takes place on a board made up of various spaces: there are spaces which increase or decrease the character's money or happiness, spaces where the player can spend their money to buy things to increase their happiness, and spaces that trigger various events. The game ends when the goal has been reached a set number of times, and the winner is the player with the most happiness at the end of the game. Up to four players can play, with the computer taking control of any remaining characters.
