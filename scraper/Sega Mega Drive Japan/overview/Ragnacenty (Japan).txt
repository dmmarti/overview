Before the time of plants and animals, the earth was completely dark, and inhabited by things we now call 'monsters'. When some voice said 'Let There Be Light' , many monsters died because they could not live in this new light world. Not all died however; some of them hid in caves, and grew stronger. Now, they want to return to the world, and in these days you live your life. 
 
On your fourteenth birthday you are given your deceased father's sword and shield. Now you are considered ready for the trials and maybe, just maybe, you can become a hero yourself.
