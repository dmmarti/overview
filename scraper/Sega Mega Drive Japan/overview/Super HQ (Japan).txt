Similar to Chase H.Q. in some ways: same gameplay, same number of stages, and same objective. If you haven't heard of this game before, you basically drive on a freeway trying to catch up with five criminals who have committed felonies, but time is against you. If you catch up with the criminal's vehicle, you can ram into it to do some damage. If you do enough damage, the car malfunctions and you arrest the suspect. You can also use up to three turbo boosters that comes equipped with the car if you are far behind the suspect.
