Advanced Busterhawk Gley Lancer, commonly known as Gleylancer (グレイランサー), is a 1992 Sega Mega Drive shoot-'em-up by NCS released exclusively in Japan (despite having some of its text, such as in the Mover configuration screen described below, in near-perfect English). It was released internationally on the Wii Virtual Console in 2008. Despite the English configuration screen, translation group M.I.J.E.T. released a patch which translated the story text in 2006-2007.
