Putter Golf is a simple, fast-paced miniature golf game for one player. The player's only control over the ball is choosing the direction and power of the shot, and they must get the ball into the cup within par. Each of the 18 holes contains bizarre hazards like bumpers, lava pits, moving walls, and ice. For each stroke over par, the player loses one ball; if all balls are lost, the game is over. However, the player can regain balls by shooting under par.
