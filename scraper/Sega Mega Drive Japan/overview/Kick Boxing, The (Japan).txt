Best of the Best Championship Karate is a realistic fighting game. 
After you choose your fighter for his parameters (strength, stamina and resistance), you can choose from 55 different moves. 
You can now train your fighter at a gym before the real fights. 
To master the game, one must alternate training and fights, as training improves stamina, strength and resistance. 
Be careful, loosing a fight reduces those parameters, so you have to be ready before getting on the ring !
