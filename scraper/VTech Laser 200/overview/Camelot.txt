Camelot is an 8-bit computer game written by Tony Oakden and published in the UK in 1989/90 for the BBC Micro and Acorn Electron. The game was first published by Superior Software and Acornsoft as part of the Play it Again Sam 9 compilation in 1989 and was subsequently re-published as a standalone title in 1990 by Superior Software and Blue Ribbon.

In Camelot, the player assumes the role of a deposed king, trying to prove his worthiness for the throne. The main goal of the game is to collect 3000 points by recovering bags of gold scattered around the flip-screen castle the game is set in. Killing enemies also increases the score, though in less amounts.

The game consists of shooting, platform and some puzzle elements. Fighting various creatures, like witches and demons, is preferably done by shooting fireballs at them, of which there is a finite amount at the player's disposal. In addition to enemies, various hazards, like pools of water, may additionally drain the player's energy and thus need to be avoided. It's possible to pick up and carry up to 5 different objects. Collecting a key for example can give access to a different area. The protagonist's only life is lost when either all of his energy gets drained or the time limit runs out, both however, may be replenished through the course of the game.
