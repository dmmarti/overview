You are a gravedigger called Samuel, and you've heard of the famed Loodam Crypts and all the riches they contain. The game is a top down action/puzzle game quite similar to Paganitzu.

Your goal is to collect as many jewels as possible, while avoiding monsters and traps, and then search for the exit. You have a shovel which can be used to kill weak enemies and can find stronger ones as the game progresses. Most levels have a puzzle solution that requires setting combinations of switches in the correct order and finding keys.
