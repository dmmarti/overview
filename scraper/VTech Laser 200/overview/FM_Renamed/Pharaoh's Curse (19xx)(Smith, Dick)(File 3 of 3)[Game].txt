Control an adventurer who, during an excavation finds the legendary tomb of the pharaoh Dig-Dughamen, while searching for treasures the terrible curse of the tomb starts to take effect, snakes and beetles begin to pursue him incessantly. The player has a shovel to dig and a gun to hit enemies, but it won't do any good, when one dies, another one will appear in its place.

Pharaoh’s Curse has an interesting plot, but as plot is not everything, the game ends up being very repetitive, with the same enemies chasing you in the same way, in the same scenario.
It is worth remembering that the game is interesting, just as time goes by it ends up a little boring.
