First “Tiny Games” collection for kids. The games offer a diverting experience with age-appropriate session lengths.

Tiny Games – Knights &amp; Dragons is the first in a series of mini-games collections for kids. Its look and gameplay is designed for kids, and the games offer a diverting experience with age-appropriate session lengths.

The collection offers these 5 games:

Ludo: A board game where you throw dice and try to be first to move four tokens to your own home base.

Chest Mover Mania: A puzzle game where you move a chest to a target. No easy feat, as the board is restricted and you can't pull the chest.

Ship Encounter: An exciting tactics game. Hide your own ships well, and carefully consider the target for your next cannon ball.

Find Mines: A math game that poses the tricky task of finding mines on a field. Your only clue: The number of mines in adjacent fields.

4 in a row: A tactics game where you try to get a row of four tokens – before your opponent does!
