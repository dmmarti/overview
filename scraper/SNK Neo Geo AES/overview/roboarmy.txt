A mad scientist decides to create an army of robots to destroy the city, capture all the citizens, and use their brains for more robots to take over the world. You control one of two robots who use its fists and special attacks to take on the army throughout a jungle stage and various buildings in the destroyed city. Robots and robot dogs sometimes leave arms or metal bars that can be used as weapons. At the end of each area, you need to defeat a boss in order to proceed to the next area.
