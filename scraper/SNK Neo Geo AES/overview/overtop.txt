In 1991, ADK (then Alpha team) released Thrash Rally for the Neo Geo. While fun to play, it was most noted for its woefully bad graphics. Five years later, ADK released another "look-out-for-the-next-turn!" game called Overtop. This time they got it almost all right: Great graphics, good sounds, lots of vehicles, and kept the excellent playability of its predecessor.
