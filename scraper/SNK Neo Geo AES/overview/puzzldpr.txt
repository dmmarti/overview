The game consists of shooting colored globes to match and remove other colored globes of the same type. Very similar to Bust-A-Move/Puzzle Bobble, other than the fact that you receive special globes. There are bombs (to destroy spiked globes), aiming globes (which show the path of flight in the form of a dotted line), and magic globes which destroy all globes of the color in which it touches.
