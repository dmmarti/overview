Last Resort is a 1-2 player horizontal shooter game where you pilot a spacecraft across horizontally scrolling cityscapes and wastelands, while destroying hordes of enemy spacecraft, either metallic or organic, including huge mid- and end-level guardians. Getting power-up pods provide the craft with a movable drone which can be charged up and fired or locked into position and used as an extra gun or 'battering ram'/shield. A clone of R-Type (both one and two), but with much improved graphics and sound
