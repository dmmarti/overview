The super-hero must stop the destruction of a city at the hands of a giant robot and its maker. The object, as Eightman (or Nineman), is to move left or right punching enemies and fight a boss at the end of the level. In some levels, you are chasing after a vehicle while enemies jump out at you. Power-ups can be collected along the way, which, when collected will make your kicks and punches stronger as well as give you bombs which are used to damage all enemies. If a two-player game is in progress, a spark will be between them and their bomb power will be increased.
