The game uses a control setup consisting of a single flight stick with two fire buttons and two "Event" buttons which flash when the player is able to trigger certain events in game such as summoning backup fighters. The player advances through 3 stages and can choose them in any order. Each stage is based on a single scene from the Star Wars trilogy. Players can score points by destroying enemies, completing levels, and performing "combo" hits on enemies in succession without missing a shot.   Star Wars Episode IV: A New Hope: This stage depicts the Battle of Yavin, right up to the destruction of the Death Star.   Star Wars Episode V: The Empire Strikes Back: The famous Battle of Hoth is depicted, and the player must assist in destroying AT-ATs as well as invading Echo Base.   Star Wars Episode VI: Return of the Jedi: The player rides a speeder bike on Endor and shoots Imperial troopers, then moves towards the Empire's base and destroys an AT-ST.  The game ends with the final space battle from Return of the Jedi with the destruction of the Death Star II. Two bonus stages are included where the player duels Boba Fett and Darth Vader using a lightsaber. The player must quickly execute joystick motions to block Fett's shots or Vader's lightsaber swings and take them down. Failing these stages will not cause the game to be lost but bonus points will not be gained.
