In the game, the player takes the role of a Chicago paramedic and ambulance driver, trying to save several people and taking them to the nearby hospital. There are two modes of gameplay: automatic transmission and manual transmission. The first victim is a ten-year-old child named Jack. His family's station wagon was in a collision with a tanker truck. The second victim is a 35-year-old Chicago Police officer named Edward, who has been shot by a gang (who somewhat resemble Yakuza), with a rocket launcher. The third victim is a 23-year-old woman named Kate. The hotel she and her partner were staying at has caught fire, and she is pregnant. The final mission is to rescue Gregorio Tavaresky, the 48-year-old President of an unspecified country, whose airliner has crashed into Lake Michigan after being struck by lightning
