Scud Race came in either Twin or Deluxe cabinets, which can be linked together for up to four players. The game was modelled after the BPR Global GT Series (now known as the FIA GT Championship), featuring the cars of four prominent teams in the 1996 season. The game features four different courses of varying difficulty, though two are Beginner level (with the difference being day and night time.) And just like Daytona USA, an arcade operator can put the game in Grand Prix or Endurance Mode for longer races. There has never been a console release, although there was a tech demo of this game for the Dreamcast back in the late 90's (Which may have turned into the Sega GT series.)  The four Scud Race tracks are presented as an unlockable bonus in the Xbox version of OutRun 2, rearranged as a whole OutRun route instead of separate tracks with a number of laps each to race.  The opponent cars, aside from the selectable cars at the main screen, are all Renault Alpine GTA/A610s.
