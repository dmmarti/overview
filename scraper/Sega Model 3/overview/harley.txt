In Harley-Davidson and L.A. Riders, the player rides one of five Harley-Davidson models. The objective is to complete a series of checkpoints around Los Angeles under a time limit. The number of stages allotted depends on the machine's settings. It can be three, four, or five stages. The player also has to collect as many hidden items (such as "tokens" that resemble the Harley-Davidson logo) as possible, in order to earn bonus points. The token points range anywhere from 1,000 to 100,000 points. The tokens which are more lucrative (that range in larger point sizes from 10,000-100,000) are located in more obscure and irrelevant areas of Los Angeles. Tokens that are worth 3,000 points are located through street corners. Others that are worth 10,000-50,000 points are located in special areas such as the golf course in Beverly Hills, where a token worth 30,000 is located. Tokens worth 100,000 are more difficult to get and are located in obscure areas. Occasionally, the player will find red-yellow-colored tokens floating around more irrelevant areas that allow you to earn 5 or 10 seconds of bonus time
