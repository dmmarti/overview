Le Mans 24 is an arcade game by Sega produced in 1997 and is based on the Sega Model 3 Step 1.5 arcade system board. The game is based on the race of the same name with some of its cars from the 1996 race including those that appeared in Scud Race, henceforth it was licensed by its organisers, Automobile Club de l'Ouest. Only GT1 and Group C cars make appearances in the game with the JWA Gulf Porsche 917 (a Group 5 racer, under the pre-1972 rule amendment) appearing as a bonus car which is unlocked after finishing the first race.
