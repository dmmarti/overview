The Lost World: Jurassic Park is a first-person LightGun rail shooter made as a tie-in to the 1997 movie of the same name and a follow up to the 1994 Jurassic Park arcade game by the same developer. It consists of five stages based on environments from the film, such as a laboratory or the workers' village. Two male rangers travel through Jurassic Park in a jeep to find and save Ian Malcolm and Sarah Harding who have gone missing after landing on Isla Sorna.  The game uses fixed, cinematic camera perspectives that move on when all dinosaurs in a scene have been killed. By moving to the edges of the screen it is possible to scroll slightly. The gun only has five bullets and reloading is done by pointing to the side along with a downward motion. A single credit provides three lives that deplete when a dinosaur manages to attack or someone innocent is shot. Many objects in the environment are destructible, including barrels that cause explosions. Bonus points are provided for snipe and quick shots.  There are often boss fights against large dinosaurs with a health meter shown on the screen. Optionally power bars can be picked up that are converted into additional lives. The game offers some opportunities to save humans from attacking dinosaurs. If this is done before they are killed, a temporary weapons upgrade or additional health is provided. At the end of each stage a score is calculated based on the number of hits, technical shots, hit rate and a score for clearing the stage. At the start the player can choose from three difficulty levels: beginner, expert or shuffle. The game supports cooperative multiplayer with a second player shooting on the same screen using cross-hairs with a different colour. A second player can join at any time.
