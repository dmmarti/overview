Players use the truck lever and action pedal to control the rail car, whilst simultaneously attempting to dodge and outrun enemies attempting to steal their precious stones. This two-player game will certainly have you working up a sweat, as you pump the levers of the cart to increase speed. With multiple unique scenic routes, each with an array of obstacles and threats, there is much to be explored. The water-based side of the game adds a different aspect to the experience, with two of the routes based either on or below the water, adding potential dangers from both aggressive sharks and hungry crocodiles.
