Aswell as Scud Racee, Sega also created Scud Race Plus as an update to the game in 1997. This version allowed players to play any of the four courses in reverse.  Scud Race Plus also included the bizarre "Super-Beginner" course, an oval track inside a giant-scale children's playhouse. featuring a rocking Horse also bowling pins which you could hit. Exclusive to this course, players could press Start at the car select screen to race as a cat, a tank, an “AM2 crew” bus and a rocket car.  There is also an attract mode, which is not in the game where a red sports car runs in an Italian village and destroys the Roman Coloseum.  The background with the giant wheel is actually blue rather than yellow orange.  There was no American release of Scud Race Plus. Apparently, Sega never marketed this version outside Japan, but it is possible to switch the country to "USA" and get "Sega Super GT Plus" which features everything from Scud Race Plus, but in the American format. In this version, the suitable for all ages by Sega could be seen before the Winners Don't Use Drugs warning.
