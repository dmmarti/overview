Video games featuring The Hulk focus on raw power, destruction, and action-packed gameplay. Players take control of the iconic green superhero, smashing through enemies, vehicles, and entire city blocks with overwhelming strength.

Hulk games often emphasise open or semi-open environments where destruction is a core mechanic. Combat is typically fast and brutal, rewarding aggressive playstyles and creative use of the environment. As players progress, they may unlock new abilities, combos, and strength upgrades, further enhancing the sense of unstoppable power.

With their emphasis on chaos and spectacle, Hulk games offer a power fantasy that stands apart from more tactical superhero titles, capturing the character’s rage-driven identity.

This collection contains games from Arcades, Computers, Consoles and Handhelds.
