Health constantly drains over time, creating a sense of urgency and encouraging aggressive play. Players must manage resources, collect power-ups, and support one another to survive increasingly difficult stages. Gauntlet is especially famous for its multiplayer focus, making cooperation central to success.

Fast-paced action, simple controls, and constant pressure make Gauntlet a standout cooperative experience that remains enjoyable across generations.
