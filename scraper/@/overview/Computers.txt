Early home computers appeared in 1977, with the Sord M200 Smart Home Computer,[1] Apple II, Commodore PET and TRS-80. Soon after, almost every manufacturer of consumer electronics rushed to introduce a home computer. Large numbers of new machines of all types began to appear during the late 1970s and early 1980s. Mattel, Coleco, Texas Instruments and Timex, none of which had any previous connection to the computer industry, all had short-lived home computer lines in the early 1980s. Some home computers were more successful â€“ the BBC Micro, ZX Spectrum, Atari 800XL, PC-88, PC-98, Commodore 64, and MSX, sold many units over several years and attracted third-party software development.
