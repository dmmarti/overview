Video games based on **Aladdin** bring players into a colourful world of magic, adventure, and heroic daring inspired by the classic tales of *One Thousand and One Nights* and their well-known animated adaptations. These games capture the spirit of Aladdin’s journey, combining fast-paced action with a sense of wonder as players explore bustling streets, royal palaces, mysterious caves, and enchanted skies.

Most Aladdin games are built around side-scrolling platform and action gameplay, where agility, timing, and quick reactions are essential. Players guide Aladdin as he leaps across rooftops, avoids traps, outsmarts enemies, and collects gems or power-ups along the way. Familiar characters such as the Genie, Princess Jasmine, and the villainous Jafar play key roles, adding personality and narrative depth to the experience. Many titles are remembered for their smooth animation, detailed backgrounds, and energetic music that help bring the fantasy world to life.

Across different systems, Aladdin games often vary in style and difficulty, offering unique interpretations of the same story. Some emphasise precision platforming, while others focus on combat or exploration. Together, these games highlight how a timeless adventure has been successfully adapted into interactive entertainment that remains enjoyable for players of all ages.
