The SEGA SF-7000 Super Control Station was made to expand SC-3000 computer capabilities. Its design with neat lines and compact shape makes this unit incredibly simple, but so elegant and beautiful.

It connects to SC-3000 by a special cable with a cartridge. Itâ€™s not known why this cable is so short that you must put the computer above Sf-7000, but this choice by SEGA made the overall look so different and elegant compared to its competitors in the eighties market.
