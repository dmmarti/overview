The Specialist is a DIY computer designed in Soviet Union. Its description was published in Modelist-Konstructor (Russian: Моделист-Конструктор), a magazine for scale model builders in 1987. It was the first such publication in a magazine not oriented on electronics. It gained limited popularity with hobbyists, though some factories produced DIY kits.
