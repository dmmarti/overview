The Super Acan is a home video game console that was released exclusively in Taiwan in 1995 by Funtech. Inside is a Motorola 68000, also used in the Sega Genesis and Neo Geo. Twelve games have been confirmed to exist for the system.

At an initial price of NT$2,900 (about US$110), it was too expensive for regular consumers. It was released in the 3D era, where the PlayStation 1 and Sega Saturn were already out, making the console a commercial failure due to its outdated 2D graphics. In 1996, they pulled the plug and unsold units were disassembled and were parted out to various companies in the USA and abroad. The massive loss of revenue due to the Super ACan failure forced UMC to close Funtech Entertainment Corporation.
