The Super Cassette Vision was released in 1984 as the successor to Epoch's Cassette Vision. The system was also manufactured and distributed for Europe (particularly France) by a company called ITMC. In Europe it was called the Yeno Super Cassette Vision. In 1985, Epoch decided to release a limited edition version called Lady Cassette Vision. The pink colored console came bundled with it's own carrying case and a game called Milky Princess.
