Video games based on Boxing bring the intensity, strategy, and athleticism of the sport into interactive form. These games range from realistic simulations that focus on timing, stamina, and footwork to arcade-style experiences that emphasize fast punches and dramatic knockouts. Players must balance offence and defence, carefully choosing when to attack, block, or evade.

Many boxing games include career modes, allowing players to train fighters, improve skills, and climb the rankings toward championship bouts. Others focus on quick matches with simplified controls, making them accessible and competitive for casual play. Sound design, crowd reactions, and commentator-style audio often enhance the sense of realism and tension inside the ring.

Across generations, boxing games have captured the thrill of one-on-one competition, rewarding patience, precision, and smart tactics while delivering exciting, high-impact action.
