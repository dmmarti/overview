Video games in the Fatal Fury series are classic one-on-one fighting games that helped establish SNK as a major force in the genre. Set in a gritty, character-driven world, the series focuses on martial arts combat, rivalries, and personal stories.

Fatal Fury introduced several innovative mechanics, including multi-plane fighting, allowing characters to move between foreground and background lanes. Combat emphasizes timing, spacing, and mastering special moves, making each match feel tactical and intense. Characters are distinct in both fighting style and personality, contributing to the series’ strong identity.

Known for its dramatic presentation, detailed sprite work, and memorable soundtracks, Fatal Fury helped shape competitive fighting games. Its influence can still be felt today, especially through characters and mechanics that carried over into other iconic SNK franchises.
