The Zemmix Neo is a console originally created by a team in Korea. It was never commercially released, and only a 100 units were created. The system is based on the design of the One Chip MSX, with the addition of a scanline generator.

The team subsequently created a cost reduced version, the Zemmix Neo Lite, the main difference being the aluminium casing. This version was created in slightly larger numbers and bought by various users outside Korea.

The Zemmix name is a homage to the Daewoo Zemmix game consoles, and means 'It's Fun' in Korean.
