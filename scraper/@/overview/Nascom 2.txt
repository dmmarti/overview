The Nascom 2 was a single board computer kit issues in the United Kingdom in 1979 and based on the Zilog Z80.  It included a keyboard, video interface, a seria port, and two 8-bit parallel ports.  To minimize cost, the buyer had to assemble a Nascom by hand-soldering about 3,000 joints on the single circuit board. Later on, a pre-built, cased machine named Nascom 3 was available; this used the Nascom 2 board.
