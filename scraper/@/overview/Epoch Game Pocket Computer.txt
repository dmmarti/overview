The Epoch Game Pocket Computer is a handheld game console released by Epoch in Japan in 1984. It was one of the very few truly handheld systems to be released in the early 1980s, preceding the Game Boy by 5 years. The Game Pocket Computer used an LCD screen with a 75 Ã— 64 resolution,and could produce graphics at about the same level as early Atari 2600 games. The system was a failure in Japan, and as a result, only 5 games were made for it.
