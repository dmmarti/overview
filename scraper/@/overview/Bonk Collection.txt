Video games starring Bonk feature a prehistoric hero navigating colourful worlds with a unique head-based combat style. Known for its bright visuals and cartoon charm, the series became a memorable platforming franchise during the late 1980s and early 1990s.

Bonk gameplay centres on side-scrolling platform action, where players use headbutts to defeat enemies, climb walls, and interact with the environment. Levels are filled with secrets, collectibles, and imaginative enemy designs inspired by prehistoric themes. The controls are accessible, yet require precision to master advanced movement and timing.

The series is remembered for its expressive animation, upbeat music, and playful tone. Bonk games emphasize fun and creativity over realism, offering a lighthearted platforming experience that remains nostalgic and enjoyable today.
