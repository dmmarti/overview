The Acetronic MPU-2000 is another Interton VC-4000 "software compatible" system (saying "clone" would be misleading). That is to say that the internal specs are exactly the same and that games would run on both systems. The cartridge slots are however different in shape and cartridges won't fit in each others. This group of consoles is often refered as "Interton VC-4000 compatible system" as the VC-4000 maybe the most popular of all the other systems.
