The Sorcerer is one of the early home computer systems, released in 1978 by the videogame company Exidy. It was comparatively advanced when released, especially when compared to the contemporary more commercially successful Commodore PET and TRS-80, but due to a number of problems, including a lack of marketing, the machine remained relatively unknown.
