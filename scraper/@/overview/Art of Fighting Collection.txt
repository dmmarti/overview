Video games in the **Art of Fighting** series are a cornerstone of classic fighting game history, known for their cinematic presentation, deep mechanics, and strong character-driven storytelling. Developed by SNK, the series helped shape the one-on-one fighting genre during the early 1990s by introducing innovative ideas that set it apart from its competitors.

Art of Fighting games focus on intense martial arts combat, featuring a roster of distinctive fighters, each with their own fighting styles, special moves, and personal motivations. Battles place a strong emphasis on timing, spacing, and resource management, most notably through the introduction of a spirit or energy gauge that limits the use of powerful techniques. This added a layer of strategy, forcing players to balance offence and defence carefully.

One of the series’ most memorable features is its visual storytelling. Characters visibly take damage during fights, becoming bruised and exhausted as battles progress, enhancing immersion and tension. Detailed backgrounds, dramatic zooming camera effects, and expressive animation further contribute to its cinematic feel. Across multiple entries and platforms, Art of Fighting evolved while retaining its identity, earning a lasting reputation for challenge, depth, and style.
