Video games based on Galaga are among the most iconic fixed-screen shooters ever created. Players control a lone spacecraft battling waves of alien enemies that move in distinctive, coordinated patterns.

Galaga is especially known for its risk-and-reward mechanic, where players can rescue captured ships to gain dual-firepower. This adds strategy to the fast-paced action, forcing players to choose between safety and greater offensive power. Enemy attack patterns become faster and more aggressive as stages progress.

With tight controls, colourful visuals, and unforgettable sound effects, Galaga remains a benchmark for arcade shooter design. Its balance of challenge and fun continues to attract players across generations.

This collection contains games from Arcades, Computers, Consoles and Handhelds.
