Video games in the Pitfall series are classic action-adventure platformers that helped define early exploration-based gameplay. Players control a jungle adventurer navigating dangerous terrain filled with pits, vines, crocodiles, and hidden treasures.

Gameplay emphasises timing, memorisation, and careful movement rather than combat. Players must leap over hazards, swing across gaps, and explore branching paths to uncover secrets. The open-ended level design was groundbreaking at the time, encouraging exploration and discovery.

Pitfall is remembered for its pioneering design, minimalist presentation, and influence on future platform and adventure games. Its sense of danger and exploration remains iconic.

This collection contains games from Arcades, Computers, Consoles and Handhelds.
