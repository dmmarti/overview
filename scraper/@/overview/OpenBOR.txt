OpenBOR is an open source 2D customisable video game engine designed by Senile Team. It is a continuation of the Beats Of Rage 2D game engine. In 2004 Senile Team released Beats of Rage (BOR), a free beat-'em-up for DOS inspired by SEGA's classic "Streets of Rage" series of beat'em ups and using sprites from SNK Playmore's "King of Fighters" series. The game amassed popularity very quickly. Senile Team soon released an edit pack allowing anyone interested to create a module for the BOR engine. Later, in 2005, Senile Team opened the source code to BOR, and OpenBOR was born. Development on the engine was continued by the community, and still is to this day.
