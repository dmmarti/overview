Tekken video games are among the most popular and technically sophisticated 3D fighting franchises. Players select from a diverse roster of fighters, each with unique styles, combos, and special techniques, engaging in one-on-one matches that demand timing, precision, and strategy.

The series is known for its deep combat mechanics, including juggling combos, throws, counters, and movement strategies.

Tekken has a strong competitive scene, offering multiplayer tournaments and ranked play that challenge both casual and professional gamers. The franchise combines striking visuals, realistic animations, and detailed environments with responsive controls, creating an immersive and rewarding fighting experience.
