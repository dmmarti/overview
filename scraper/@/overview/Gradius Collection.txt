Gradius video games are legendary side-scrolling shooters that helped define the genre with their intense action and strategic depth. Players pilot advanced spacecraft through hostile alien environments, facing relentless enemy waves and massive screen-filling bosses.

A defining feature of Gradius is its innovative power-up system, where players collect capsules and choose when to activate specific upgrades such as speed boosts, missiles, shields, or options. This system adds tactical decision-making to the fast-paced gameplay, rewarding smart planning as much as reflexes. Levels are carefully designed to test precision flying, memorisation, and adaptability.

Gradius is also celebrated for its striking visual design and iconic music, which enhance the sense of scale and urgency. Across many versions and platforms, the series has remained faithful to its challenging roots, making it a cornerstone of classic shooter history.

This collection contains games from Arcades, Computers, Consoles and Handhelds.
