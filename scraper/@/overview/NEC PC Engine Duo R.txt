The PC Engine Duo is an attempt to "simplify" the complex nature of the PC Engine and its growing number of add-ons. It is essentially a PC Engine and Super CD-ROM2 rolled into one unit - a means to play HuCard, CD-ROM2 and Super CD-ROM2 software without the need for extra purchases. It also integrates the functionality of the Super System Card, in a sense becoming the console of choice for PC Engine enthusiasts. 

Integrating the system cards into the console means that unless the user is running Arcade CD-ROM2 titles, the PC Engine Duo's HuCard slot remains empty when playing CD-based games. This means Duo systems are open to a form of software piracy - unlicensed publishers could offer a special HuCard to bypass security concerns, essentially creating a range of Duo-only software (disregarding that for a short period, all Super CD-ROM2 software was effectively Duo-only).

However, given that the CD unit is no longer detachable, the PC Engine Duo cannot be used in conjunction with a PC Engine SuperGrafx nor a PC-8801 MC. The removal of the PC Engine's rear expansion port (and the differing shape of the unit) also makes it incompatible with several other PC Engine accessories.
