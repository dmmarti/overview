TeknoParrot is a software package allowing you to run selected PC-based arcade titles on your own hardware, with full support for keyboard and mouse controls, gamepads, steering wheels and joysticks.

TeknoParrot currently supports games for various arcade systems, mapping the proprietary add-on hardware found in these systems to commodity PC peripherals, and fixing any other limitations in the game software that prevents them from running on standard Windows systems.
