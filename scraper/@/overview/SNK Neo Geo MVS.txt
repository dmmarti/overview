The Neo Geo, stylised as NEOÂ·GEO, also written as NEOGEO, is a cartridge-based arcade system board and fourth-generation home video game console released on April 26, 1990, by Japanese game company SNK Corporation. 

The Neo Geo originally launched as the MVS (Multi Video System) coin-operated arcade machine. The MVS offers owners the ability to put up to six different cartridges into a single cabinet. With its games stored on self-contained cartridges, a game cabinet can be exchanged for a different game title by swapping the game's ROM Cartridge and cabinet artwork. 

A home console version was also made, called AES (Advanced Entertainment System). The AES had the same raw specs as the MVS and had full compatibility, thus managed to bring a true arcade experience to home users. As of 2013 it was the most expensive home video game console ever released, costing US$1,125 adjusted for inflation.
