The TRS-80 Micro Computer System (TRS-80; later known as the Model I to distinguish it from successors) is a desktop microcomputer launched in 1977 and sold by Tandy Corporation through their Radio Shack stores. The name is an abbreviation of Tandy/Radio Shack, Z-80 microprocessor. It was one of the earliest mass-produced and mass-marketed retail personal computers. Notable features of the TRS-80 included its full-stroke QWERTY keyboard, its then-new Zilog Z80 processor (rather than the more common Intel 8080), 4K RAM standard memory, small size and desk footprint, its floating-point BASIC programming language, an included 64 column video monitor, and a starting price of US$600 (equivalent to US$2400 in 2016). An extensive line of upgrades and hardware peripherals for the TRS-80 was developed and marketed by Tandy/Radio Shack. By 1979, the TRS-80 had the largest selection of software in the microcomputer market. Until 1982, the TRS-80 was the best-selling PC line, outselling the Apple II series by a factor of 5 according to one analysis.
