The Memotech MTX500, MTX512 and RS128 are a series of Zilog Z80A processor-based home computers released by Memotech in 1983 and 1984. They were technically similar to MSX computers, but were not compatible.

It uses a dedicated chip for video (Texas Instruments TM 9918 or 9928) and sound (Texas Instruments SN76489A) and has a very nice mechanical keyboard and a nice black aluminum case!

Both models have the same characteristics, but the MTX 500 has only 32 KB RAM and the 512, 64 KB. It had no success and was replaced a short time later by the RS-128.

The MTX512 made a minor cinematic appearance in the film Weird Science as the computer the two lead male characters use to hack into the Pentagon mainframe.
