The Interact Home Computer is a rare, very early (1978) American home computer made by Interact Electronics Inc of Ann Arbor, Michigan. It sold under the name Interact Model One Home Computer. 

The original Interact Model One computer was designed by Rick Barnich and Tim Anderson at 204 E. Washington in Ann Arbor, then moving to the Georgetown Mall on Packard St. in Ann Arbor. The President/Founder of Interact Electronics Inc was Ken Lochner, who was one of the original developers of the BASIC language based out of Dartmouth college.

Only a few thousand Interacts were sold before the company went bankrupt. Although it was mostly a game machine (with games such as Showdown, BlackJack and Chess), users could also create their own programs using the BASIC computer language. Later on the design was sold to a French company, and re-branded as the Victor Lambda for the French market.
