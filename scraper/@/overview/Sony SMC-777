Sony began selling the SMC-777 (three-seven) personal computer in November 1983. Aimed for the home market, it came with a built-in 3.5-inch floppy disk drive. Designed to be used without needing any special knowledge, the SMC-777 could be operated by inserting a floppy disk with the appropriate software program into the computer and selecting the required functions from a screen menu with the cursor keys. The SMC-777 came with an original disk containing simple programming languages, software, and games to familiarize users with computers and get them interested in programming while having fun.
