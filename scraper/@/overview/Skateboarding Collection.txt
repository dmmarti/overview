Skateboarding video games focus on performing tricks, mastering movement, and navigating urban environments. Players chain together jumps, flips, grinds, and manuals to score points or complete objectives. Physics-based controls reward precision and creativity, while free-roaming levels encourage exploration. Many games include progression systems, customisation, and licensed soundtracks that reflect skate culture. The genre balances technical skill with expressive freedom.

This collection contains games from Arcades, Computers, Consoles and Handhelds.
