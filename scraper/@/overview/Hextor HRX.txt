The Hector HRX follows the 2HR, and takes over exactly the same machine, while technically stretching it on certain points. The main evolution comes from the amount of RAM that goes to 64 KB, allowing it to display double the number of colors on screen. The machine also now has a cartridge port, which ultimately was used very little, mostly only near the end of its life. It is indeed the last machine of the French firm for the Victor / Hector range.
