The Electronika BK was a series of 16-bit PDP-11-compatible Soviet home computers developed by NPO Scientific Center, the leading Soviet microcomputer design team at the time. It was also responsible for the more powerful UKNC and DVK micros. First released in 1984 (developed in 1983), they were based on the ?1801??1 (Soviet LSI-11-compatible CPU) and were the only "official" Soviet home computer design in mass production.
