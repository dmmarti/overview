The Thomson TO8 is a home computer introduced by French company Thomson SA in 1986. It replaces its predecessor, the Thomson TO7/70 while remaining essentially compatible.

The new features of the TO8, like larger memory and better graphics modes, are shared with the other third generation computers (Thomson MO6 and TO9+). The TO8 has a tape drive and Microsoft BASIC 1.0 (both a standard and a 512 KB version) on its internal ROM, and there is optionally an external floppy drive. Graphics were provided by the Thomson EF9369 chip, allowing the display of 16 colors from a palette of 4096.

An improved version, the Thomson TO8D, includes a built-in 3.5" floppy drive.
