Frogger video games are timeless arcade classics built around simple objectives and precise timing. Players guide a frog across busy roads and hazardous rivers, avoiding vehicles, predators, and environmental dangers to reach safety.

The gameplay is easy to understand but becomes increasingly challenging as speed and obstacle density increase. Each successful crossing requires quick decision-making and careful movement, rewarding focus and rhythm. Frogger’s fixed-screen design and escalating difficulty make it endlessly replayable.

Bright visuals, iconic sound effects, and instantly recognisable gameplay have kept Frogger relevant for decades. Its elegant design remains a perfect example of how simple mechanics can create lasting appeal.

This collection contains games from Arcades, Computers, Consoles and Handhelds.
