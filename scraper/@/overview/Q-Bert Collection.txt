Q*Bert video games are classic arcade action-puzzle titles focused on movement and timing. Players hop across a pyramid of cubes, changing their colours while avoiding enemies.

The diagonal movement and isometric perspective add challenge and uniqueness. Increasing enemy types and faster pacing create escalating tension.

Q*Bert’s quirky visuals and sounds have made it an enduring arcade icon.
