Tennis video games simulate the classic sport with a focus on timing, precision, and strategy. Players control athletes on various surfaces—grass, clay, or hard courts—managing serves, volleys, smashes, and positioning to outplay opponents. The genre ranges from realistic simulations with accurate physics and professional rules to arcade-style games emphasizing fast-paced, exaggerated action.

Career modes, tournaments, and multiplayer options provide replayability, while customization allows players to create unique characters, adjust difficulty, and compete in leagues. Tactical play, such as anticipating an opponent’s moves and positioning for optimal shots, is central to success. Many tennis games include mini-games or training modes to improve skills or add variety.

The genre is celebrated for its accessibility, offering quick matches for casual players while also rewarding skill, timing, and strategy for competitive play. Tennis video games capture both the excitement of professional matches and the fun of friendly competition.
