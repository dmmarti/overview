The Coleco ADAM is a home computer, and expansion for the ColecoVision (port 3), released in 1983 by American toy manufacturer Coleco. It was an attempt to follow on the success of the company's ColecoVision video game console. The ADAM was not very successful, partly because of early production problems, and was orphaned in early 1985.
