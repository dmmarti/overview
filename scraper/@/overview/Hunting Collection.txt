Video games based on Hunting aim to recreate the strategy, patience, and realism of tracking wildlife in natural environments. These games often focus on exploration, observation, and precision rather than fast-paced action.

Players must consider factors such as wind direction, animal behaviour, terrain, and equipment selection. Many titles include realistic weapons, large open maps, and progression systems that reward careful planning and skill. Ethical hunting mechanics and conservation themes are sometimes incorporated.

Hunting games appeal to players who enjoy slower-paced, immersive experiences that emphasise realism and attention to detail.

This collection contains games from Arcades, Computers, Consoles and Handhelds.
