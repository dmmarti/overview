R-Type video games are side-scrolling shooters known for strategic pacing and biomechanical enemy design. Players use a detachable force pod for offence and defence.

Levels are carefully designed to reward positioning and memorisation rather than constant firing. Large bosses and atmospheric visuals create tension and spectacle.

R-Type is regarded as one of the most thoughtful and influential shooters ever made.

This collection contains games from Arcades, Computers, Consoles and Handhelds.
