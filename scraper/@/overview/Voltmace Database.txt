The Voltmace Database Games Computer is a console released by British firm Voltmace in 1980. Prior to that, Voltmace had been involved in selling Teleng consoles in the UK however they moved on when Teleng left the video games market. In 1980 they worked with Waddingtons, famous for selling traditional games like Monopoly and Cluedo, in selling their Database system. A year later, they bought the rights to the console in itâ€™s entirety.

The console is cartridge based and includes two controllers. The controllers have a joystick, 12 regular buttons and 2 fire buttons; just like the 1292 Advanced Programmable Video System.
