The PMD 85 is an 8-bit personal computer produced since 1985 by the companies Tesla Piešťany and Tesla Bratislava in the former Czechoslovakia.

They were deployed en masse in schools throughout Slovakia (while the IQ 151 performed a similar role in the Czech part of the country). The first Czechoslovak video games were created on the PMD 85 (other platforms were ZX Spectrum and Atari).

The production was local due to a lack of foreign currencies for purchasing systems from the West. After the Velvet Revolution in 1989, the production was stopped. The PMD 85 was not competitive in quality or features compared to foreign PCs available at that time.
