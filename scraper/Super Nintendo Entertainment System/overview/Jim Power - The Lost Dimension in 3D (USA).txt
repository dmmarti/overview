In in this altered and expanded port of the original Amiga title,  Earth has always blocked "The Lost Dimension" and now its alien guardian, Vaprak, threatens to annihilate Earth to free its brethren in the dimension.  Special Agent Jim Power has been sent in alone to send Vaprak back into "The Lost Dimension".

Armed with your upgradeable blaster, space ship, and jet pack, you will blast and jump you way across "The Lost Dimension" taking down its inhabitants before any contact from them takes your life.
