An evil organization, named AGYMA, threatens the 200 years of peace the galaxy has enjoyed.  From their base on the far side of the moon they have infiltrated many important locations on Earth.  Working for the Earth Defense Force, you are the lone pilot of a special craft designed to fight off AGYMA: the XA-1.

The game is a side-scrolling shoot 'em up with 6 levels, and a total of 8 state of the art weapons with which to fend off the attacks and thwart AGYMA's plot to destroy Earth and disrupt peace throughout the cosmos.
