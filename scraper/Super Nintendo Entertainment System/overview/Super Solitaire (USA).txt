Super Solitaire is a SNES version of the classic solitaire card game with 12 varieties of play (Klondike, Free Cell, Golf, Cruel, Pyramid, Stonewall, Doesn't Matter, Aces Up, Florentine, Poker, Canfield and Scorpion). It features classic artwork for backgrounds along with optional cartoony graphics. Very soft music is included on the track. The game also sports options where you can choose to skip to the next card when stuck or get a hint on what to do.
