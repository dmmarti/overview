Microprose's F-15 Strike Eagle series returns with an edition for the Super Nintendo. Super Strike Eagle puts you in the cockpit of an F-15 as you attempt to force various governments back into the United Nations.

To accomplish this, players must bomb targets, shoot down enemy fighters, and sink ships. Gameplay takes place in both the first-person and third-person perspectives.
