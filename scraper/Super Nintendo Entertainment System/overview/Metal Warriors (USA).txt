Get deployed in your own giant mech and battle through nine linear levels against the evil Dark Axis forces. Eject and switch robots, piloting one of the six "Battledroid" suits; but watch out because there are no save games and no continue codes.

For the best of Metal Warriors, grab a friend for some head-to-head combat in the PvP mode. The variety of robots and levels means the matchups stay surprising and interesting.
