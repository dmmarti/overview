The intergalactic menace Belser has been long-defeated. However, he is rising again and is ready to cause trouble. Only a group of well-trained starpilots can defeat him. You take to the stars in this horizontal and sometimes vertical scrolling shooter. There are several power-ups to be obtained in your mission to defeat the evil Belser. 

There are three ships to choose from, each having different weapons for attack. There are eight attack levels for each, increasing with each Red Orb collected. The Blue Orb gives a limited defense shield.
