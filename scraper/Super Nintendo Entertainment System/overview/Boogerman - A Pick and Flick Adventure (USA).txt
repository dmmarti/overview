Boogerman is just your standard jump n run... no, wait! You usually don't flick boogers or fart on your enemies in standard jump and run games, do you? Well, here you have to, at least if you want to stand a chance against the evil Boogermeister. The game features about 20 levels of dirt, slime and bad taste in worlds like "Mucous Mountains", "The Pits" or "Flatulent Swamps". Parents will want to keep this game away from young children.
