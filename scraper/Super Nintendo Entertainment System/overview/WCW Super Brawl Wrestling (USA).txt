SuperBrawl is one of the earliest wrestling titles with the WCW (World Championship Wrestling) license. It has 12 different professional wrestlers to choose from including Sting, Ric Flair, Big Van Vader, The Steiner Brothers (Rick & Scott) to name a few.  The standard moves are present including punches, kicks, pile drivers and power slams including special unique finishers for each wrestler.

The modes include Single and Tag Team matches that support a two-player option with the ability to customize options including time limits and rules. Passwords are also present so that players can pick up and play at their leisure.  The view is a 3/4 overhead view with the ring catty-cornered on the screen similar to Fire Pro Wrestling.  Tony Schiavone also lends his voice to the game for in-game commentary.
