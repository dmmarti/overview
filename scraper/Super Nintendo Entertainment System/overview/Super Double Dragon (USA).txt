Billy and Jimmy Lee return for another adventure. This time, fellow martial arts instructor and narcotics investigator, Marian, has disappeared while attempting to infiltrate the ruthless criminal mob known as the Black Shadow Warriors.

Once again it is up to you (and a friend) to battle your way through a selection of side-scrolling beat 'em up levels to defeat the Shadow Warriors and their leader Duke, and save Marian.
