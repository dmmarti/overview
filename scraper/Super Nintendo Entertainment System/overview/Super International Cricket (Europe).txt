Super International Cricket Eight teams are included: Sri Lanka, Australia, England, South Africa, New Zealand, India, Pakistan and the West Indies. However, like its predecessor, Super International Cricket lacks official team and player licensing.The game comes in three difficulty levels ranging from easy to hard. Games in the "World Series" and "Test Match" modes could go on for five virtual days and still end in a draw.Some of the players are named after the game developers (M. Parker is Marshall Parker, G. Anders is Gavan Anderson, A. Milgrom is Alfred Milgrom). Each player has a speed rating that determines how fast that they are able to gather runs for their respective teammates.Bowlers have a choice between four types of ball delivery using four unique speeds for the actual ball delivery. The Australian method of scoring cricket is used; which is different from the international method. Only one stadium is used in Super International Cricket.
