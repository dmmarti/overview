You select your character from the movie (Luke Skywalker, Han Solo, Princess Leia, or Chewbacca) before each level, as each one has different abilities, and go try to beat levels based on the movie's scenes brandishing lightsabers, blasters or crossbows, etc. depending on your choice of character.

Gameplay consists of standard platform action spiced up with some slightly different (gameplay-wise) sequences. Race to Jabba the Hutt's palace in a speeder, fight your way through Jabba the Hutt's minions before killing Jabba himself, control speeder bikes and the Millennium Falcon, and much more.
