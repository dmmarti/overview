Some Superheroes possess incredible strength, others can fly or make themselves invisible; Captain Novolin has the power of ... diabetes! And he is going to need that power when aliens (appropriately disguised as sugary junk food) come to take over the earth under command of their leader Blubberman.
The first action the aliens take to pursue their evil plan is to kidnap the mayor of Pineville, who has only enough diabetes supplies for 48 hours!

On his quest to save the mayor and defeat the aliens, Captain Novolin has to complete several Jump 'n Run levels while dodging attacking aliens and managing his diabetes. Before every level he has to take the right dose of insulin, and he shouldn't pick up more food items than he is advised to.
