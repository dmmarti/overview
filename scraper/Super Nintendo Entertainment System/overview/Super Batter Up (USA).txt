Super Batter Up is a baseball game with both a 1 and 2 player mode plus a league mode. The game carries the MLBPA license, but not an MLB license, so it only features all the players from the 1991 season playing for a team in a city that they really play for. Players get to play in either a dome, modern, or traditional stadium each with their own unique characteristics.
