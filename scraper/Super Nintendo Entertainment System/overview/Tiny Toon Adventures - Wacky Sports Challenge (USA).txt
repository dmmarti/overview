Tiny Toon Adventures: Wacky Sports Challenge has the player take control of either Buster Bunny, Babs Bunny, Dizzy Devil, or Plucky Duck in a variety of Olympic-type events: ice cream throw, weightlifting, saucer throw, obstacle course, a flying contest called the birdman contest among more.  There are four difficulty settings to choose from (Easy, Normal, Hard and Super) each unlockable through passwords which are represented by Tiny Toons characters.

Players can utilize the multitap, which allows four human opponents to face off against each other. The game also features graphics and animations from the TV show, but does not feature any voice overs from the characters.
