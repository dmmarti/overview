Hammerlock Wrestling is Jaleco's take on wrestling with a style geared towards Saturday Night Slam Masters.  The player can choose from 12 fictional wrestlers and compete in four different modes of play.  There is also 60 different moves to choose from as well as unique finishers for each wrestler.

The Exhibition mode allows up to four different players to compete either against each other in singles match or in tag team format.  Champion League Match is a round robin-type tournament with six different wrestlers competing for the league championship.  Tournament is the standard tournament format with eight different wrestlers involved and Top Ranking Match where the player must battle through the other eleven wrestlers and defeat each one to become champion.

The game is divided into three different screens at times.  The middle part shows the current action happening in the ring while the top and bottom parts of the screen are used for close-ups of action sequences such as power moves, illegal moves and finishing maneuvers.
