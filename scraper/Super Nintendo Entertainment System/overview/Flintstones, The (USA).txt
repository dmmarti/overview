The Flintstones is based on the live-action motion picture but the levels and controls differ from the Game Boy version.

You still play as Fred in this side-scrolling platform game and you must get home from the Quarry, rescue Pebbles and Bam-Bam, Barney and Wilma from the evil Cliff Vandercave. In addition to the differing levels, the game has three weapons. You can still jump but that is not how you defeat enemies. Instead, you have a club and a limited supply of bowling balls to roll and rocks to throw.
