Krisalis’ fourth licensed Manchester United game – the title refers to their success in winning both the Premier League and the FA Cup in the same (93-94) season –- something only six clubs have achieved.The gameplay is overhead view, and has much in common with Kick Off, offering loose control, a range of moves, and an emphasis on short passing. It’s not easy at first, but persistence reaps rewards, especially with a two-button controller.Making life easier is the Tacti-Grid tactics editor, which allowed you to customise tactics by instructing players on exactly where they go when the ball is in a particular position. The editor is the most comprehensive ever seen in an action football game, allowing you to rename players, change their appearance and skills, transfer them across clubs, move clubs around the divisions, change their kits, and more.
