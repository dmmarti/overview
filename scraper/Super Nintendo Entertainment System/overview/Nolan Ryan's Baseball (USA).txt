A baseball game featuring both a pennant race and a single game mode.The pennant race features 12 different teams (6 teams to each league), vying to make it to the All Star final. The pennant can vary in length from 10,30, 60, or 130 games depending on the player's choice. The game keeps tracks of all the baseball players statistics and tallies them up for several different league leader categories. Players can also trade baseball players and choose free agents for their team. Players can also create baseball players, edit the attributes of already existing players, and also select a manager for their team. Both pitching and batting is done from a behind the batter view. When pitching the player can throw either a fastball, a change-up, or a curveball.
