NCAA Basketball models a college basketball season, including March Madness (if your team qualifies!) and the Final Four (if you make it that far!). Teams represented are from the Big East, Big 8, ACC, SEC, and SWC conferences (some are missing because rights could not be secured). If season play is not for you, you can play exhibition games, but if you make it to the Final Four, you can save your game and have the option of using any team you like.
