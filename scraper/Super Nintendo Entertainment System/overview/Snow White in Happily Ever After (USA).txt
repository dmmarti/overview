Follow the further story of Snow White after the evil Queen's death. Her brother Lord Maliss, who can take the form of a dragon, changes Snow White's Prince into a monster Shadow Man. You can play as Snow White or Shadow Man and must go through eight levels full of platform obstacles and enemies to free the kingdom from his evil sorcery. This side-scrolling platformer is based on an animated movie by Filmation released in 1993. You collect fruit and stars through each level and can jump on some enemies or throw apples at them (which are also used to break through blocks). Be careful as you jump on platforms as going to close to the edge can cause you to lose balance and fall. On the screen, your health is shown by a heart. If you get hit by an enemy, fall down a pit, or fall from too high, it will decrease by one. If it reaches zero, you lose one of three lives. Some special attacks can be used, if possessed, like apple bombs. Eventually a sign "Find The Exit" will appear and you can exit to the next level. If you make it to the end, you must fight Maliss in dragon form. You can change the difficulty level or choose a continuous play option as well.
