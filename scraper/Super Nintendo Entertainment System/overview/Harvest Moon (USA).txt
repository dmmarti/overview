Ever wanted to live life on a farm, with nothing but the sun, the fresh scent of your crops, the muddy fields underneath, and cows and chickens to keep you company? Well, you're in luck, because you have just inherited your grandfather's ranch, but it's in a terrible state of disrepair! What ever can you do?

You're going to do like the farmers do; roll up your sleeves, get down in that dirt, fix that farm up and make it the best farm anyone has ever seen! It sure gets lonely on that farm...but not to worry! There are plenty of girls in the village, and if you treat them right and manage to win their love, you've got yourself a wife!

So let's go, farmer! You've got 2 years to make a name for yourself on that farm! Work hard, and the rewards will be great!
