Ninja Gaiden Trilogy is a compilation of the three games in the series previously released for the NES:

1. Ninja Gaiden
2. Ninja Gaiden II: The Dark Sword of Chaos
2. Ninja Gaiden III: The Ancient Ship of Doom

All three games tell the story of ninja Ryu Hayabusa through alternating cinematic cutscenes and levels of 2D side-scrolling action.  The graphics and sound are essentially the same as in the originals, but enhanced for the SNES.
