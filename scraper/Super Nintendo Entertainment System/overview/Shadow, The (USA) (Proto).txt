The Shadow was a canceled SNES game published by Ocean. It is based in the
film of the same name.

The gameplay is similar to other Beat 'em up games such as Final Fight or
Double Dragon, where the player controls The Shadow through several levels
fighting against several enemies. The player has two bars; one is the life
bar and a bar that allows the player to perform special attacks
(invisibility, gun play, speed running, a dome shield that knocks out
everyone who hits it). It also contains a driving stage where The Shadow
battles Mongols on motorbikes (Maritech Labs), and roughly follows the plot
of the movie.
