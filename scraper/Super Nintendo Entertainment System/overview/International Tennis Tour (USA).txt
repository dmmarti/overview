International Tennis Tour puts the player behind the racket of a generic male tennis player going up against a plethora of other generic players in various game modes.  There is a practice mode where the player can learn the in and outs of the game along with an exhibition mode where they can choose settings, rules and opposing players.

They can also compete in tournaments and a career mode where they start off with a set amount of money, using it to enter more prestigious tournaments in order to win and gain more money to enter higher tournaments.  There is also a multiplayer option that lets two friends play head-to-head or team up in a doubles match against the computer A.I.
