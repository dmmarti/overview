Revolution X is about the ol' Rock & Roll.

There is an evil nation putting the youth down and banning our beloved rock music. Who you gonna call? Aerosmith!
With the help of Aerosmith, the player must shoot his/her way through enemy infested levels, (light) guns blazing, collecting power-ups and releasing hostages.

Almost all of the graphics are digitized and Aerosmith themselves are too! There are also lots of fmv videos.
