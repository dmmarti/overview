Bowser is at it again!  He's using a time machine, called a Timulator, to loot historical artifacts from the past, in order to stock his museum.  He plans to destroy the time machine after, and therefore change the course of history forever.  It's up to Mario to stop Bowser and return all the stolen artifacts to their rightful place in history!
