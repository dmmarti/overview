Your character embarks on a quest to find the seven crystals that are hidden throughout the land of Ticondera. There are seven different characters to choose from, each with different beginning stats and specialties.

The game is presented in a 2.5D perspective, but shifts to an over-the-shoulder semi-3D view when combat initiates. Combat is turn-based, depending on which character you choose, your combat will either be almost entirely melee or magic-based. Potential enemies wandering around the world cannot be seen, however a radar map helps indicate enemies as as white dots.
