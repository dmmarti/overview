ACME Animation Factory is essentially Mario Paint with a Looney Tunes license.  The player can choose from 18 pre-set animations of their favorite cartoon characters and super impose them over a scene to create their very own cartoon.  Much like Mario Paint, they can also color blank drawings, create their own music and even play games like Solitaire and Mix 'n' Match.  Players can also save their own creations for later viewing.
