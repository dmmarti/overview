In the sequel to Zombies Ate My Neighbors you as the kids - Zeke or/and Julie - have to save the world from demon the lord of skeletons, ghouls, ghosts and etc.
Shooting them by super-new weapons like Plasma Gun or Lobbing Smash Gun, you need to rescue ten trapped victims on each level and fight the boss at the end. But also you have to remember that ammo is limited.
