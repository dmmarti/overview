The first football (�soccer� to you Americans; how come your game called �football� features virtually no kicks, and even then only from 2 designated players?) game to challenge the supremacy of the Kick Off series. The graphical view is from a distance overhead, making the players small on screen but making around half the pitch visible. 

The basic control system involves loose control, making running with the ball (�dribbling� in football parlance) a skill to master, and putting the emphasis on  one-touch passing, which can be easily performed by tapping the fire button.

The game features customisable league and cup competitions as well as pre-set ones including the 1992 European Championships. There are 168 teams in total, 40 European nations, the 64 top club sides, and 64 custom teams with names ranging from self-indulgent to comical, and their details are fully editable. At club and country level, each team has 3 star players who are more gifted that the others, use them wisely.
