A game that simulates the sport of bass fishing. It offers both a practice and a tournament mode. In the tournament mode, players have to reel in some large bass, then have up to five of their largest catches weighed. Competitors are ranked by whoever brought in the heaviest haul and the player must at least rank the third heaviest during the weigh-in in order to move on to the next stage of the tournament.
