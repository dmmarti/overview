This is a single player or two player simultaneous game.  It has wonderful "Super Deformed" type graphics set in ancient Japan and an above average difficulty.

You play as the Princess Pocky and her Racoon Rocky.  Run through each level beating the enemies and you'll face a goofy boss at the end.  Beat him and you're on to the next level.

You fight and shoot your way through numerous levels based on temples and shrines.  Pocky shoot playing cards and Rocky shoot leaves for long range attacks.  For short range Pocky uses a rod and Rocky his tail.

Pocky also has a spin attack and Rocky can freeze into a invulnerable statue. (Think Tanuki Mario)
