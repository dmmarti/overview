The sequel to GP-1, the player once again can race with motorcycles on 17 different tracks located across 14 different countries. The player also has six different bikes to choose from.  Players can also upgrade their bikes by winning races and earn points, earning enough points will let the player obtain better parts for their bike.

The season mode, otherwise known as the Grand Prix is present along with a Practice and Race mode, but there is also a Battle mode that allows two friends to duke it out head-to-head on the track of their choice.  A password feature is also present to allow players to pick up and play at their leisure.
