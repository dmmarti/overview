F1 Pole Position 2 is basically the same game as its predecessor F1 Pole Position. It is a racing game based on the Formula 1 with the possibilities to participate in the World Grand Prix (a whole season), battle mode (a single race with configurable parameters like number of laps) and training. The game is more on the realistic side of the genre and allows to customize many parts of the car, e.g. brakes, tires of shifting.
