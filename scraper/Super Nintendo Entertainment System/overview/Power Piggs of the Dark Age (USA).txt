The player is put in the role of Bruno, an anthropomorphic pig who has the task to defend his land which is currently under siege by wolves. Bruno comes equipped with a sword and the ability to throw donuts that he finds throughout the six levels of the game. Bruno also has the ability to jump and to also butt slam crates. No description of this game would be complete without mentioning the blowholes which are liberally sprinkled throughout each level. These blowholes will lift Bruno in the air so that he will be able to get to higher plateaus that he simply couldn't get to by just jumping normally.
