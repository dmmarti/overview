Full Throttle Racing takes in chaotic, violent and no-holds-barred racing across America. The racing takes place on both land and water, with motorbikes and boats featured.

There are 6 racers in the game, each with their own short profile, including a guy newly out of jail, a token woman and a token African-American. You can race one or both disciplines, racing either an individual weekend or a full championship.

As you play the game you can upgrade your vehicle, with faster engines, better tyres and more nitros. As in Road Rash, throwing your legs out at the other riders is potentially advantageous.
