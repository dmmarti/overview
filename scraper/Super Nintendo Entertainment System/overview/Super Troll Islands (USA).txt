Arcade platform game, based on the license of those bright-haired cute naked chaps. Each scrolling level was initially shrouded in an animated "mist". Large rectangles of mist could be cleared by running around platforms and ladders in the correct order. As the mist cleared, a brightly-coloured background was revealed. All the usual platform enemies and pickups abounded.
