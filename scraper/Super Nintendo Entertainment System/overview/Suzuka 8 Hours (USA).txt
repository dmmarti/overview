This recreation of one of the classic motorbike races uses Super FX technology for the rotating graphics. Five different variations of the circuit are featured, each one progressively more difficult. 250cc, 400cc and 750cc bikes are featured, each one available to be best for top speed, acceleration or handling. The bikes have two steering methods - leaning into the corner or tilting in with the bike upright -the options allow you to set which of these is controlled on the pad and which use the L and R buttons. Races can be set to last for between 15 minutes and the full 8 hours. Your ultimate aim is to win every type of race, across all bikes and circuit layouts.
