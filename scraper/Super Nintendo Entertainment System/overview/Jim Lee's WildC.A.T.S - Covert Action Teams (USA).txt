Jim Lee's WildC.A.T.S: Covert Action Teams is based on the comic book heroes by Jim Lee. The players take control of three superheroes, Spartan, Maul and Warblade, as they travel through each level, fighting numerous mutants and robots to force a final showdown with the main antagonist, Helspont, who is bent on world destruction.

The gameplay is a basic side-scroller, using punches, kicks, and the heroes special powers to defeat enemies. Players can also combine their heroes to create more powerful moves.
