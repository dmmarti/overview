Wicked 18 is a golf game with a twist.  The player takes control of a golfer on the most extreme 18 holes of golf with tall mountains, canyons and various objects and obstacles ready to stop the player at any time.

There are four different game modes to choose from: Stroke, Match, Skin and Tournament with the ability to play against three other friends in a heated match.  There is also a battery back-up that saves the players progress after each hole is completed.
