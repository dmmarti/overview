Brett Hull Hockey lets the player take control of NHL great Brett Hull along with 600 NHLPA players and all of the NHL teams of the time including their respective names and logos.  The player can choose to play in an Exhibition mode either against the computer A.I. or a friend, Playoffs or in Season mode with three different length options (a full season, half a season or an 11-game season).  The game simulates hockey action including slap shots, body checks, hat tricks among many other real-life hockey moves.  Al Michaels also lends his voice talents to the game for in-game commentary.
