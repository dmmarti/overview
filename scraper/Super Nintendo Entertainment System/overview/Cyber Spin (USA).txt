Cyber Spin is a top down racing game.  The player takes on the role of Chuck Davis, superstar teenage racer, driving in the Cyber Car.  Chuck faces seven opponents in Grands Prix across ten nations.  The main obstacle in Cyber Spin is the power supply.  Power is depleted when turbo is used and also when damage is taken.  When there is no power left, the race is over for Chuck.
