This game combines basketball with some of the most popular rappers of the time as choose-able players.  Some of the artists included are: Public Enemy, LL Cool J, Naughty By Nature, Queen Latifah (!), Yo-Yo, House Of Pain, Onyx, Warren G. and Coolio. The gameplay is modeled after the fast-paced NBA Jam and takes place on various outdoor courts in 5 different U.S. cities.  Up to four players can compete, and the "Xtra" button works similar to turbo.  There's a shot meter that enables you to sink jumpers and rattle the rim. No 3-point shots exist and there are no fouls in the game.
