Race a Kawasaki Ninja Motorcycle or Jet Ski over 3 different islands in the Caribbean. When you're ready, take the Challenge to see how good you really are! Look down at your vehicle from a bird's eye view and cross bridges, make sharp turns, knock other opponent's off the road (or ocean) and get first place, if you can! You get to choose from a selection of 3 Motorcycles and 3 Jet Ski's when you race. You must complete 5 laps on each level and try to get first place!
