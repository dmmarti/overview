This side-scrolling platform game was designed to teach children with juvenile diabetes how to take care of their condition to avoid the need for urgent care. You play as one or both (in a two-player game) diabetic elephants, Packy & Marlon, in Camp Wa-kee which has been invaded by rats that have stolen food and medical supplies. The elephants must find where the supplies are hidden around the camp while also remembering to check their blood glucose levels, taking insulin, having a balanced diet in three meals and three snacks a day, and handling diabetes emergencies. There are 6 levels through woods, lakes, mountains, playgrounds, and haunted cabins which repeat through several days. You will encounter animal friends wearing hats who will ask you questions about diabetes. Enemies can be dispatched with peanuts or blasts of water from the elephants trunks. If you reach the end, you will have to beat Veets and Yebur, the evil bosses of the Lunch Room Crew.
