This warrior must then defeat the other members of the Squad and finally the wizard controlling it all.

Doomsday Warrior is a fighting game. Choosing one of the Doom Squad members to become to the Doomsday warriors, you must defeat your opponents. Each character has the ability to punch, kick, jump and unleash a special move (usually by being close to the enemy and using either jump, kick or punch).
