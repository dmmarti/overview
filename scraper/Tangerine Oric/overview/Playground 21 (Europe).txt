Playground 21 is a platformer (or ladder game as it's described on the cover). It consists of a number of one-screen levels (15 in total) where the player has to paint all the bricks of the platforms. This is done as the player walks over the brick. Meanwhile the player has to watch out for various obstacles that moves around. Contact with any of these lead to a lost life. Other ways to lose lives are falling from great distances or letting the time run out. The player can do no more actions than moving around, jumping and climbing ladders and therefore has to plan his movements to avoid running into obstacles. Once all platforms are painted the player gets a bonus score based on time left and moves on to the next level.
