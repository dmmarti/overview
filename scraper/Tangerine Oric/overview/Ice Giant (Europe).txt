Ice Giant is a side-scrolling shoot 'em up similar to The Empire Strikes Back and The Attack of the Mutant Camels. A wizard has sent a number of magical ice giants to destroy the player's fortress. Mounted on a winged battle beast, the player has to prevent them from doing that by simply shooting them until they die. The giants, who appear in waves of five, slowly walk towards the fortress and if they manage to reach it the game ends. The player can also die by getting hit by the magical snowballs that the giants throw. After completing the first few waves, magical snow that kills the player on contact will start falling.
