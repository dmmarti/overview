Dallas is a simulation game where the player takes control of a company in the oil business. The aim of the game is to make enough money in order to take over the rivalling company Euing Associates. The game shows a map over Texas and is played by choosing from a text menu and entering coordinates on the map. To develop an oil field the player can make seismic surveys to find good spots and then bids on concessions. Once land has been acquired the player has to first move a rig before drilling for oil. If oil is found production facilities can be built before a pipeline to Dallas is laid. To finance the constructions loans can be sought. Problems that can hamper progress include blow outs, tornadoes, accidents, increased taxes and crude oil surplus.
