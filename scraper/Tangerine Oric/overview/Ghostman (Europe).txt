Ghostman is a Pacman clone for the Oric computer. As in the famous Namco game, you steer a ball with a mouth around a maze patrolled by four ghosts. Notable differences in this interpretation is that all the ghosts are the same colour (the same colour as Ghostman and the dots, probably to avoid problems with attribute clash) – and presumably moving by the same logic – and that the maze's "tunnel" goes between the top and bottom of the screen instead of left to right.
