Zorgons Revenge is the sequel to Xenon 1. After their defeat in the previous game the Zorgons have now kidnapped Roz, the Xenon princess. She is being held in their castle and it's up to the player to rescue her. To do so he has to search and locate four magic stones that can be found in the different corners of the Zorgon Empire. They are necessary to build a bridge over the endless chasm that surrounds the castle.

The game consists of four missions. For each completed mission the player retrieves one of the magic stones. The missions can be played in any order and are as follows:
Spider Mission: A platform level where the player first has to first catch a rope to get across a pit, then avoid a spider, take a lift and hit a switch to get the stone. At the same time a monster is released that the player has to avoid. There is also a flying creature that drops stones on the player.
Space Mission: A shoot 'em up level where the player has to shoot down a number of aliens. The player moves his spacecraft up and down along the left side of the screen while the enemies advance towards him from the right. After a number of aliens have been shot down he has to defeat a freighter to get the stone.
Bird Mission: A platform level consisting of three levels of platforms. The player has to reach the highest platform by catching hold of a bird while at the time avoid getting hit by the stones that rain from the sky.
Quadnog Mission: A platform level where the creature known as the Quadnog spits venom that the player has to jump over. When close enough the player has to destroy it by reflecting its white venom. After that he has to avoid a number of laser beams, retrieve the stone and then meet another Quadnog before getting the stone.
When all missions have been completed the player uses a crane to put the magic stones into the right place and thereby bridging the chasm. The player can then enter the castle and save the princess.
