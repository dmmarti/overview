Oricmunch is a Pac-Man variant with more or less identical gameplay as the original. The player controls the Oricmuncher and has to navigate his way through a maze and eat all the dots that lay ahead of him. At the same time he has to watch out for the ghosts that roam the corridors. If a ghost catches him he will lose a life. To attack the ghosts the player has to eat a special item which will charge him for a short while. While charged he can then go after the ghosts and eat them. The game has nine levels with different maze layouts, colors and difficulty that can be either played through in order or picked from the beginning. The player advances a level when he has either eaten all the dots or all the ghosts.
