Driver is a variant of Namco's arcade game Rally X. The game takes place in a maze like city where the player drives around in a Formula 1 car and attempts to collect all flags that are located around the map. At the same time another car chases after the player's car and attempts to hit it. To dodge it the player can leave behind smoke that confuses the enemy driver and causes it to lose track of the player's car for a short while. In addition to the enemy driver the player also has to avoid crashing into rocks that are scattered around the map. Fuel is limited and passing by gas stations is necessary to recharge it. This version also has speed limit signs.
