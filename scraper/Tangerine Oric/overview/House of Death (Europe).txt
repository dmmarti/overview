House of Death is a text adventure game. The player reads the description of what the character sees, and types orders such as 'take blue key' or 'open door'. The only options are the choice of text color. To improve player immersion, a few sounds and rare graphics (mainly title and death screen) have been included. The story take place in front of a ruined old mansion, which has been used as a stage to make horror movies, until it appeared to have become actually haunted. A rumor goes that if someone can survive inside the mansion, he could find five treasures.
