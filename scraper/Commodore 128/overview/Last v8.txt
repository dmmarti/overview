The Commodore 128 version of The Last V8 takes place in the same post-apocalyptic landscape as the more basic original. You must drive your car back to your base in time while avoiding collisions with dangerous objects.

The C128 version, making use of its larger memory size and more capacious floppy disk, contains more levels with a slightly more open layout and more advanced mission objectives. The first mission, for instance, revolves around picking up fuel canisters inside a secret base, instead of the original version's plain objectives of survival and punctualness.

The steering method of Last V8 is not the usual Sprint one where you pull left or right to steer left or right; instead you simply pull the joystick in whichever direction you want to go, pulling it in the opposite direction in case you need to decelerate.
