If you've ever thought, at one time or another, "I'd certainly do a better job if I ruled that country," then this game is for you. UTOPIA puts YOU in charge of your own island state. You control the treasury, agriculture, housing, industry, educations, hospitals, and military. You allocate funds to create revenue and improve life on your island. If you make wise decisions and your people are happy, you rack up points. If not, rebels begin to infiltrate your island. There's a good change you'll find that running a country is not as easy as you might think!</Notes
