An OMINOUS CASTLE awaits you in the land of Tarmin...filled with treasures, magical items...and horrifying monsters. Out of sheer courage and curiosity you force yourself in, not knowing that your days are numbered...
With just a bow, a shield, a quiver or arrows, a sack of flour, and an empty pack you move through ENDLESS DUNGEONS and CORRIDORS, haunted by swiftley appearing DEMONS. Somewhere the DRAGON KING awaits you. You fight your way through sinister doors, hidden doors, and strange ladders that take you underground...as you collect TREASURES, SHIELDS, and WEAPONS. You encouter PHYSICAL and SPIRITUAL OBJECTS which may build your character, play dangerous tricks on you, or weaken your body entirely. You must therefore be wise and cautious as well as bold and strong! Know what to collect, and when to fight! Your ultimate goal is to DESTROY the DRAGON KING, fo there's no returning home otherwise. And you are completely ALONE! You can carry a maximum of 8 items (6 in your pack and 2 in your hands) at any time. Items can be swapped around for effective use. Keep track of treasures in your possession and of your physical and spiritual strength by checking the 4-way scoring display as you move ahead...and make sure you SLAY the DRAGON KING!
