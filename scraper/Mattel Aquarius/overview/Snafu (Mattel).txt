The contest in on! Create a maze to corner your opponents...before you are cornered your-self. Split-second reflexes keep your trail in motion -- while blocking you opponent and/or the computer in a trap from which there is no escape. Or direct a hungry serpent after your opponent, and bite his tail off before he bites yours. It's a twistin' tangle which only the swift survive. Sixteen game variations put you in control!</Notes
