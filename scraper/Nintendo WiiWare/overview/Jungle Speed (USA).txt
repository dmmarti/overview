Jungle SpeedÂ® is a lightning-fast card game for the entire family, where quick reflexes and a keen eye will put you on top.    Flip your cards, watch your opponents  and grab the totem at the right moment to win the game. Just when you think you ve got it down, a new card can temporarily change the rules and keep you on the edge.    Play starts when the first person flips their card. Moving around the table, symbols are revealed until two of the exposed cards match. Players with the matching cards must then scramble to grasp the totem in the middle of the table, the loser gets the winners cards and anything in the pot.    With paws flying, the first person to get rid of all their cards wins the game.
