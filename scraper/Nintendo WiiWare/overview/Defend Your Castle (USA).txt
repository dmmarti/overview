Defend Your Castle is a remake of the developers' earlier flash-based online game; also called Defend Your Castle.  Though many changes have been made, the story and objective remains the same: defend your castle!  Play is with the Wii Remote only.  When people attack your castle, you pick them up and fling them away with the A or B button, or use various offensive spells with the d-pad.  As the rounds advance, so will the enemies: more types of enemies will appear, and at a faster rate.  Money earned by destroying invaders can be used between levels to fund development of major castle towers, or to increase the "health" of the castle.  When playing multiplayer, the one with the highest score in the current round is declared King and gets to decide how the money is spent.  Play continues until your castle is taken, but with the ability to save between each round there's the chance to give it another try.  Enemies can also be dropped into a Pit of Conversion to turn them to your side.  Though they won't fight directly, you can assign them to one of the castle's towers, each representing a different skill.  Stone masons will increase the castle's rate of repair.  Archers will pick off incoming invaders.  The more mages there are, the more offensive spells will be available and the more quickly they'll recharge.  Demolition men... explode.  Unlike its predecessor, the Wii game is made to look as if it's made from everyday household items come to life:  Men have crayon-drawn bodies and buttons for heads.  Clouds of tissue paper on string move across the sky.  One of the spells uses an eraser to erase an opponent.  Even the players' cursors are those little hard plastic bread ties.
