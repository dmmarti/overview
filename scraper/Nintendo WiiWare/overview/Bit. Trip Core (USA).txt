BIT.TRIP CORE continues the BIT.TRIP saga in this retro-arcade-style game.        BIT.TRIP CORE continues the BIT.TRIP saga in this retro-arcade-style game. BIT.TRIP CORE adds up to an exciting action/rhythm game thatâ€™s best played while zoning out on the tunes and letting the visuals swallow you whole. The experience is inspired by games from the â€˜80s, only with a modern twist. The game play is entirely new to the series, leaving the single-axis controls of BIT.TRIP BEAT behind in favor of the ability to control two axes. If the difficulty gets you down, grab a friend and play cooperatively with two-player multiplayer. Make it to the end and youâ€™ll have journeyed one step further to completing your BIT.TRIP.
