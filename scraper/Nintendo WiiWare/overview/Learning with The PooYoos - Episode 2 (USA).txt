Welcome to the world of the PooYoos, the first fun poetic braintrainer series for children 3-6 years old.    With the PooYoos, a merry band of adorable baby animals, children will have fun while learning the basics for his or her development: numbers, letters, lateral thinking skills, shapes, colours and more. Children get to dance with their new friends and in return receive fantastic interactive rewards. With two levels of interactivity, all children, no matter their age and level, can play the activities based on plants and music.    This game has been designed for use by children who have not yet begun to read.
