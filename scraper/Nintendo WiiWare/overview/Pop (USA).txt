Pop puts a spin on the classic puzzle concept of popping bubbles. They enter the screen from different directions and players aim and need to click on them using the Wiimote. Bonus points are gained by popping bubbles in succession and this also adds time to the clock. The score and time is kept aside however until the chain is complete, and only then they are released. Chains can only be created by popping the same colour in succession without missing or waiting too long. The difficulty is not caused by a lack of bubbles on the screen, but rather by the large amount (with different colours) and the different speeds.  The single game gives players the chance to burst their way through waves of bubbles whilst grabbing power-ups (e.g. slow down the speed), multipliers, chains and aiming for worldwide high-scores. In multiplayer mode, Pop allows people to steal points from opponents and use the controller to pump up the bubbles for bigger explosions. Other power-ups darken the screen save for the player's area or immobilize the cursor by striking it with lightning. It can also be played cooperatively.
