Can YOU build the toughest Ant Nation?        The beloved childhood pastime of lazy Sundays spent with a magnifying glass and an ant farm finally arrives in its most mischievous form via the WiiWare service! You must train your colony of Super Ants using a devilishly fun toolset. Zap, torch, and manipulate your ants to make them numerous enough and tough enough to survive a variety of increasingly difficult challenges!        Zap your ants with lasers, fry them with your trusty magnifying glass, send down lightning and much more to build them to be the strongest Ants on the block!    Send your ants into war against local bullies like spiders and ladybugs. Is your colony ready for the fight?    100 missions keep you busy facing a smorgasbord of fun and wacky tasks.    Bonus mode features 20 additional challenges that allow you to get crazy with all your favorite weapons of ant destruction!    Use your Wii Remote controller to drop a virtual hammer on your ants, use your Wii Remote controller like a metal detector to find in-game gold and much more!
