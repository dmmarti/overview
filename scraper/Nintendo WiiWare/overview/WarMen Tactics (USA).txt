In the year 2013, civil unrest across the globe pushes world leaders to merge the Police and Military into one force. The Department of Control is an agency of the United Nations that acquired secret technology, which was hidden from the public for decades. Opposing it is the resistance, composed of former military members that refused to join the Department. Marco is one of them, and the game tells his story. We join Marco as he is deployed on a mission to destroy scrambler devices placed around the city. While creating this game we wanted to reflect the realism of urban warfare, therefore most of the time Marco takes cover behind walls and other obstacles. Make sure you ve defeated all your enemies before trying to access the next post.
