A fun multi-player puzzle game for the whole family.    Embark on a tropical adventure with the explosively charged Big Kahuna Party! Looking to make the ultimate party game, we started with a concept that's accessible to the whole familyâ€”the popular match-three game. On top of that, we crafted a unique multiplayer experience in which you can choose to work together to complete the challenging levels before the timer runs out or go head-to-head and compete in a frenzy of fun. To top it off, we added 99 uniquely free-flowing levels, the challenging Tiki Pole, 20 hidden tropical sea creatures to unlock, the strategic Fish Net, and last but not least, BOMBS! The result is a family party game like no other. Easy to pick up but impossible to put down. Play alone or with friends, and unleash the Tiki spirit within!
