Penned by the writers of the tongue-in-cheek SpongeBob Squarepantsâ„¢ series, Robocalypseâ„¢ - Beaver Defense offers madcap weaponry and uproarious destruction in a â€œtower defenceâ€  style game. Set in a world of wise-cracking, battling robots, players must create and strategically position static and mobile defences to stop the waves of enemies that are intent on destroying the player s HQ. Place defences before the start of each level and prepare for the enemy s onslaught! Each successive wave of enemies is tougher, so the choice and positioning of defences is essential.    The storyline follows the exploits of a wronged, mutated beaver, bent on exacting his revenge. Not only do players build static towers to stop the beaver-sent robot-onslaught, they also directly control one of several mobile and super-tough hero robots, the Thermidoom company s pride and joy. Heroes can use anything from dual chain-guns to flame throwers to fortify their HQ. These moving weapons can then be upgraded as they gain experience, becoming even more powerful fighting machines.
