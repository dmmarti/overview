Home Sweet Home is a home design simulator. The player takes the role of a professional interior designer, and must redecorate a living space within the client's budget and taste. The room and its furnishings are presented as isometric graphics with a scrolling purchase menu at the bottom.  Windows, sofas, paintings and other paraphernalia can be bought and placed on their respective spaces on the screen. Some objects can be put under other objects or over them (for example, rugs can be tucked underneath chairs, and small lamps can rest over tables). The bought objects appear discolored in a blueprint style.  A thumbs-up meter at the top of the screen shows the client's satisfaction with the work.  It decreases and increases with each object placed. After reaching the minimum mark, the build button starts flashing.  In the building process workers are assigned to build each thing in the room within a time limit. They start working on something when the player click on them (or their portraits) and one of the room blueprint features. While they build something it starts to fill slowly with full colors to indicate progress.  The workers portraits replace the menu at the bottom and show their stamina level. As they get tired, the player needs to drag and drop a jar of coffee on them or the portraits. The coffee jar starts to refill slowly when replaced on the machine. Sometimes they stop working and ask for a tool from the toolbox (a speak balloon with the tool appears over them). Every time they stop working on an object, it starts to slowly lose its colors.
