The soft star of Homestarrunner.com now has his own game series on WiiWare!     Strong Bad Episode 1     Charming. Soft. Awesome. These are the words Strong Bad would use to describe himself. In a world gone mad, only one man can be trusted to save the day. A man with an attitude. A man called Strong Bad.     As the star of the Homestar Runner web cartoons, Strong Bad has been answering emails (in boxing gloves), pranking his friends, pummeling his enemies, and making people with questionable taste snort milk out of their noses for years now. And he s branched out to star in Strong Bad s Cool Game for Attractive People, a monthly 5-episode series.    In Episode 1: Homestar Ruiner, when Strong Bad s plans to beat the snot out of Homestar backfire, he ends up with an unwanted houseguest cramping his style. Now I need to get back to normal life, by any means possible. But wait, there s more! Teen Girl Squad comics! Achievements! Funny customs! Arcade games! You can even send pictures and emails to Wii friends using Strong Bad s computer! So how about it? Can you handle Strong Bad s style?
