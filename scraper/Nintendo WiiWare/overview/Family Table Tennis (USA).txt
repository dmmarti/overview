Family Table Tennis is a sports game for the Wii. As the title suggest, you play 1-on-1 table tennis. You have a choice of 4 characters: Billy, Sarah, Mommy, and Daddy. There are 4 areas you can play at: Beach, Forest Park, Gymnasium, and Amusement Park. The way the ball goes depends on how hard you it it, so if you hit it hard, it would go to the left, soft, to the right, and in the middle, straight ahead. There are also mini-games you can play, Target TT, Thrilling TT, and Matching TT.
