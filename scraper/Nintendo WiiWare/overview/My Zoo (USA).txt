"My Zoo" is a relaxing animal sim that puts you in the shoes of an animal breeder, raising up animals you d normally only dream of. All it takes is a Wii Remote controller for a simple, yet fulfilling connection with nature. There are 12 animal types in total (four sold separately as add-on content). Select your favorites and nurture them to adulthood. Feeding them, petting them, and cleaning up their messes is a great way to form a lasting bond. Each animal s personality will change depending on how you take care of them. Watch them get spoiled, turn into over-eaters, and more as they grow on a daily basis. Some animals will even have a baby on occasion, and once it s born, you ve got another mouth to feed. Game time passes much more quickly than real time, and the different animal types are active at various hours--some during the day, and some at night. Sometimes it s fun to just kick back and watch what they do. So what are you waiting for? It s time to create your own personal zoo.
