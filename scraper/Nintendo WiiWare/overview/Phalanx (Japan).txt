Shooter game for PC "PHALANX" appeared in WiiWare. In addition to the "X68 mode" produced close to the specification of the original version, "Wii mode" with a new system and character was recorded.   Of course, that nostalgic character, huge battleship, hidden stage is also alive! If we meet certain conditions ...?   Also you can set the difficulty level so you can play at the level that suits yourself. Please enjoy "PHALANX" which the two elements of nostalgicity and newness mix.
