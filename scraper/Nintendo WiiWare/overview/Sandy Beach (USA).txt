Sandy Beach is a relaxation game released through the Nintendo WiiWare service for the Wii. Up to two players can build castles on the coastline of Sandy Beach. There are three modes of play. The first is a sandbox mode that allows the user to construct any sandcastle they want using their Wii Remote to scoop, dump, and shape sand. Use the stick tool to etch designs into the side of your castle. Find hidden items like pearls or sea shells to accessorize your sandcastles. The second mode allows you to select a semitransparent blueprint to construct your castle. This mode unlocks hidden objects for your treasure chest in addition to more castle blueprints. The final mode, Crab Battle, is a tower defense type game where crabs will attack your castle in waves. You must fortify your defenses with cannons and fend off the ever menacing crabs to protect your prized castle heart.
