Star Soldier R is a top-down shooter for the Wii. The game is unique as there are only 2 levels, as the game has a 2 minute mode (1 stage) and a 5 minute mode (2 stages). The gameplay is as simple as shooting your enemies and getting to the end. There are weapon power-ups such as multiple lasers and shields. There is also a quick shot mode where you have to tap the shoot button as fast as you can before the time runs out. You can also upload your scores to Nintendo Wi-Fi Connection and compete for the highest score.
