Welcome to ShadowPlay. Let your imagination run wild when light meets everyday objects to create fascinating shadows! Play and experiment, make a monster out of a pineapple, a dolphin out of a banana - the only limit is your imagination! ShadowPlay challenges players by transforming shadows into over 100 exciting, unique puzzles. As more challenging puzzles are unlocked, players will have to find more creative ways to solve problems. You will never look at a slice of pizza the same way again! Winning a round will allow players to advance to the next level as well as score another item to use in the Free Play Mode where you can unleash your imagination and create your own shadow art. Family and friends can also jump in to help tackle a puzzle at any time using Local Co-op Mode! ShadowPlay will provide tons of brain-racking fun for players of all ages! How do you ShadowPlay?
