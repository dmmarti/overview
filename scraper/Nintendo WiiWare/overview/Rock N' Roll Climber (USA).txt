Prepare to â€œrock outâ€  like never before in Rock N  Roll Climber. Climb rocks using the innovative control scheme, which has you controlling your character s movement using the Wii Remote and Nunchuk. If you want an even more immersive experience, optional support for the Wii Balance Board is also available. Make your way up an array of courses, ranging from the Pop level s indoor rock wall to the Heavy Metal level s waterfalls (watch out for those moss-covered rocksâ€”they re slick!). In addition to the sense of accomplishment you ll feel upon reaching the top, you might just be rewarded with your own guitar!
