When Darkness Falls, A Hero Must Rise!        Launch on a one-of-a-kind mission to rescue the stars! The universe is going dark, and it s up to you, Konki, Stellar Guardian, to put things right. Dr. Dark Matter and his roving band of space thieves have stolen many of the Constellation Stones that make up the heavens. It s time to suit up, power up, and live up to the task at hand. Recover the Stones and once again bring light to the night sky. Featuring unique use of the Wii Remote controller s Pointer capabilities, simply point and thrust Konki through 20 dangerous time- and collection-based missions in the harshest of environments. Navigate through narrow, mazelike astral caves riddled with space worms, steam pipes, and mining drills. Explore vast space stations while avoiding turret fire, mines, and huge crushing gears. Weave through cluttered asteroid fields and gaseous planetary rings, and more. Evade the hazards, pick up precious items and ship upgrades, and save the Constellation Stones before the night sky is lost forever.
