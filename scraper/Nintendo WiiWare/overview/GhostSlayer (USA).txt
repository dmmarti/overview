Embark on a thrilling ghost fighting experience. Play as a Ghost Slayer as you battle evil spirits that plague the mortal world. Your sword is your only weapon against them. Eliminate all hostiles in your path and defeat the Ghost Queen in the final stage in order to save the world. Unlock new swords and acquire special techniques which you can use to your advantage. Test your skills by playing all three levels of difficulty. Enjoy the thrill of slashing ghosts and vaporizing them by swinging your Wii Remote and experience sword-fighting gameplay at a new level of realism by using the Wii MotionPlus accessory (this game can be played with or without the Wii MotionPlus accessory). Brace yourself for the onslaught of blood-thirsty spirits.
