Choose its name and gender and dress it up by combining elements from plenty of clothes and accessories. Play solo or engage your family and friends to compete in one of the multi-player modes. Even 16 players can take part in one competition! Thanks to the balanced levels of difficulty (kid, youngster, adult) everyone can enjoy the game.
