Paint Splash turns your TV into an interactive canvas where kids of all ages can enjoy painting using the Wii Remote. Up to four people can paint at the same time so the entire family can participate in creating fantastic paintings using just your Wii Remotes. When you re done painting you can save your images onto your SD Card.
