Jump and roll with Pallurikio, a fast-paced action platformer, easy to pick up, yet challenging to master.     While playing a mysterious board game he found himself with his friends, Rusty is sucked up in a dimensional vortex and finds himself cast into mystical and wondrous world, where I assume the aspect of the round and bouncing Pallurikio.     Using the Wii Remote to point at the screen, make Pallurikio jump and roll, and help him find his way through more than 50 enticing levels, while surviving all kinds of pitfalls and trickeries he might come across when traversing Bakumbala Jungle, the Palluro Prime and many other weird settings.     Featuring physics simulation, Time Attack mode, collectable cards, and space rockets to boot, Pallurikio is a game on which you will not want to miss out!
