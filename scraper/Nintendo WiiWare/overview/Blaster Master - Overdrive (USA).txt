S.O.P.H.I.A. returns to save the Earth in this new 2D update in the long-running Blaster Master series. This new installment updates the classic NES game with a new action/adventure and re-imagining of the original frog-rescuing quest.    In this entry, the role of saving the Earth now resides in a biologist named Alex, who must investigate why a mysterious virus is mutating the planet's animals and placing the humans in a coma-like sleep... including his wife and child.  Alex must travel to the center of the Earth to restore S.O.P.H.I.A.'s missing upgrades, and fight the various mutants and bosses to proceed to new areas.  Gameplay is similar to the original game.  Vehicle "Overworld" exploration levels are set as a 2D side-scroller that opens up the 8 different world areas more (similar to other titles as the modern Castlevania and Metroid games) once the player collects the necessary upgrades.    Alex may also leave the vehicle to go on foot in order to explore the various caves and fight bosses in a 3/4 overhead perspective.
