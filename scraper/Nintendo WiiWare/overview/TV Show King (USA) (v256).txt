TV Show King portrays a standard TV trivia game show, with over 3,000 questions split into difficulty categories of Normal, King, and Genius.  Game play is for 1-4 players, and can be played in lengths of 3, 6, or 9 rounds, each consisting of 7 questions.  Between each round players have the chance to spin a wheel where they may gain or lose money, or get the chance to steal or give money to another player.  At the end the top two players face off in a first-to-five-correct competition.  The actual questioning works by displaying a question on screen with the four possible answers below it; 15 seconds are given to pick the correct answer.  A player chooses the answer with the Wii Remote, so everyone can see what they've picked.  However, speed is rewarded: the second person with the right response will get less than the first person, and so on.  It's possible to switch your answer at any time, so it's quite possible to follow the crowd (or fake them out).  In later rounds a gimmick can be introduced to make the player use the Remote to see the answers, either by "scratching away" a covering in front of them or using the pointer like a flashlight where only the illuminated circle can be read.  Players choose Miis to represent themselves; if fewer than four are playing, the remaining spots will be taken by random Miis from your system being pulled out of the crowd.  If one is playing alone and doesn't wish to go through the normal game, there's a solo Quiz Attack mode, where you continue play until giving an incorrect answer.
