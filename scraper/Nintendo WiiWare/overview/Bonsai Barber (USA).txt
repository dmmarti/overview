A tasty nibble of a game, it is bite-sized barbering at its finest, in only minutes a day.    The village residents are hungry for the latest in foliage fashion, and it s up to youâ€”the new barberâ€”to fix them up. Use the tools of your trade: scissors, clippers, spray can, and more, in this humorous, first-of-its-kind â€œfirst-person-groomerâ€  game.    Bonsai Barber features a colourful cast of twelve intriguing customers, including a temperamental shallot starlet (don t call her an onion!), an oddball strawberry boffin, a cactus cowboy, a daredevil carrot, and a suave banana with top-secret clearance.    Each day, five customers arrive to test your stylistic skill. If the customer requests a specific style, you ll plow that furrow, or you can rely on your expertise to pick from over thirty popular fashions... Or why not turn over a new leaf; be creative and see how they react!    They re a demanding bunch, so if you miss an appointment, you ll hear about itâ€”on your Wii Message Board. But, if you do a good job, you may receive a gift or even a postcard from an exotic destination, as your happy customers travel to distant lands and show off their exquisite coifs.
