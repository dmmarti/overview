Relive the old school days of Arkanoidâ€¦    ARKANOID Plus! is an updated version of the original arcade blockbuster. Players must destroy colored blocks by guiding an Energy Ball around the screen using a spaceship called a VAUS. The game features a host of new modes and settings which radically alter the gameplay experience: "Arcade Mode" consists of 61 Rounds divided into left and right versions with two types of boss characters appearing in the last Round; "VS Mode" lets players face off against a friend or the CPU; and the unfailingly frantic "Time Mode" challenges players to clear Rounds within a strict time limit. Factor in the subtle differences arising from the choice of â€œLivesâ€  or â€œBarrierâ€  rules, along with a plethora of exciting items, and it s clear you re in for hours and hours of blockbusting fun!
