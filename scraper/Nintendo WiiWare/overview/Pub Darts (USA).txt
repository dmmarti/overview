Pub Darts is a simple darts simulation which uses the Wii Remoteâ„¢ controller s unique controls to mimic dart-throwing motion.        The game is set in a local pub where the players will settle in to play some of their favorite dart games, including 501, Cricket, Around the Clock, Killers and Baseball. Controls function just like throwing a real dart. Players are able to create their own personal profiles, including selecting their avatar image from a collection of creative characters and the design they would like displayed on the dart flights.
