Cricket Challenge is an arcade-style sports game that gives you a fun-filled experience while playing as a batsman in a game of cricket. Using the Wii Remote like a real cricket bat, you can swing and control the actions of a batsman to make him play strokes, hit boundaries, 6s and try a variety of shots.        The game is set up in a playground amidst an urban background with buildings, apartments and a lush green outfield giving a casual feel to the game.
