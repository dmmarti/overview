Grab your Wii Remote and build balanced stacks in this engaging and challenging physics-based puzzler.    Grab your Wii Remote controller and build a balanced stack in this physics-based puzzler! Puzzle games must be engaging. This was our top priority during the development of the game. That s why we designed 100 levels that not only challenge your skills but also your imagination. The game is easy to pick up and hard to put away. Play alone or invite a friend to grab a second Wii Remote controller and drop in at any time for co-op play. We even added a dedicated two players split-screen "versus" mode for extra fun.
