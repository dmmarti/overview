According to legend, a deserted town now serves as the lifeless reminder of a once-powerful kingdom. The young son of a missing king reaches this land after a long journey, finding only an abandoned castle-and a magic crystal. Though tarnished by years of neglect, the crystal has maintained its luminous glow and bestows upon the boy the power of architek, the ability to manifest memories into reality. With the help of his loyal servants and courageous adventurers, the new king dutifully prepares to rebuild his people s homeland in this new realm.
