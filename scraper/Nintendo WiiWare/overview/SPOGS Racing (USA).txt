SPOGS Racing is a racing game for the Wii and PC. The game has four modes, which are Season, Crash N' Grab, SPOG Maker, and Quick Play. The main gameplay is to race your SPOG (Sports Player Object Gyros) against other SPOGS around 6 tracks. Season lets you play through all the game courses, with a choice of 3 difficulties. Crash N' Grab lets you select how many laps you race, what course you want to play on, how many opponents you race, and lets you crash into your opponents for upgrades such as engines and tires. SPOG Maker lets you create your own SPOG by selecting a POG and editing it. Quick Play randomly chooses the settings of the race.
