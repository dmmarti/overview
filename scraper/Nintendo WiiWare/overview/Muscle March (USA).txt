Muscle March is a quirky Japanese action game stuffed full of macho bodybuilders. The all mighty protein powder has been stolen so it?s up to Tony and his muscle-bound crew to catch the thieves. Choose from a variety of perfectly molded superstars and bring these terrible villains to justice. As each thief attempts their escape, they will smash through walls while making a variety of poses. You must match these poses to fit through the holes and catch up to the thieves. The protein powder will be yours again!  Flex your muscles by yourself or with up to four friends in turn based macho excitement.  Posing for a few minutes not enough? Enjoy Endless mode until your muscles bulge and explode!  Muscle March will also be the first WiiWare title to offer a polar bear in Speedos.
