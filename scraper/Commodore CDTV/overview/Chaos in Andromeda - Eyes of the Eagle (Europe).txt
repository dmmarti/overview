Chaos In Andromeda: Eyes Of The Eagle is a Role-Playing game, developed by Kirk Moreno and published by On-Line, which was released in Europe in 1991.    A sci-fi RPG adventure in which you wander the surface of a planet solving mysteries. From the start, it's off-putting because you have to go through an unnecessary rigmarole setting up your character. Even when you get into it there's none of the fascination that makes you want to explore. Professional presentation; amateur ideas.
