Congratulations! You have been personally selected from literally thousands at possible candidates to experience “The Town With No Name". The silvery round thing enclosed (what we in the trade refer to as a ‘compact disc‘ should be handled carefully by its edges and placed within your favourite disc caddy. The procedure for loading the caddy into the machine is detailed in your manual (remember, the book-shaped thing you threw away when you first unpacked your CD-ROM?). Once you have the CD disc in the CO-ROM you will be faced with a sign listing 3 possible options. Using the arrow keys move the pointer onto the word "Tutorial" and press button 'A' to discover just about everything you ever wanted to know about "The Town With No Name" but were too afraid to ask! Way out west, there are places you shouldn't go, people you shouldn't mess with, and meals that'll ventilate your britches. So, when the Man With No Horse rode into town and shot Evil Eb's littlest brother, it could only mean one thing; That Mr Diablo's Undertakin' Emporium ("Flexible Credit Terms Available - Die now, pay later") was going to be busy! “The Town With No Name" takes the multimedia experience another step forward with this vast interactive cartoon feature. Play your part as the story unfolds around you. but remember, the Hole In The Head Gang don't take prisoners! The Town with No Name was a game released for the Amiga CDTV, developed by Delta 4 Interactive and published by Sierra On-Line. The Man With No Name enters The Town with No Name via The Town with A Train to start the Console with No Game. He meets many odd characters in town, like the bartender, the year-long hooker, Abraham Lincoln, and Death himself. Our protagonist also can defeat evil outlaws like Evil Eb, Wildcard McVee, and Nasty Ned. If you kill enough of his minions, Eb will plead forgiveness and eventually befriends you. You can also go back on the train and fly to outer space, but that isn't the proper ending.
