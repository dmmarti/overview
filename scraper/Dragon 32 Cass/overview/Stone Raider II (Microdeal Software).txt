The Dragon or Tandy Coco never received an official conversion of Boulder Dash, but they did receive one or two home-grown clones. Stone Raider II has all the features of the original, with the fast enemies, the digging, the falling stones and the set amount of crystals that must be collected to open the exit. A particular enemy is the slime, which multiplies to fill all open space, and is dangerous both to the player and other enemies. There are 25 levels to complete. Except for being published by MicroDeal as well, there is no relationship to the original Stone Raider (later re-released as Stone Raider II), also based on Boulder Dash, but different.
