Despite the strange name, this is a fairly straight conversion of Konami's Scramble. You start out flying your spaceship above a hostile grounds, protected by ground-to-air missiles. You can shoot down the airbourne missiles, or bomb them on the ground. Also posted on the ground are fuel silos which you must bomb from time to time to replenish your own fuel supply. As the game progresses, the open terrain changes into a cave system with more diverse enemies, including the traditional jumpy ones known from the original arcade game.
