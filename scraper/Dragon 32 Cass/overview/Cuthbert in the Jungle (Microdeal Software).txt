Poor Cuthbert is in trouble again. He failed to overcome the Moronians(see "Cuthbert_Goes_Walkabout" and "Cuthbert_Goes_Digging"), so he has been sent to the jungle, where his troubles are many. He must fight his way through the jungle collecting treasures, jumping pits and swinging across alligators whilst being aware of the killer scorpion in the basement.
