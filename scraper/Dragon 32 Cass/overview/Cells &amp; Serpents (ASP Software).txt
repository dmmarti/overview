The game: Cells and Serpents is an adventure game set in an underground labyrinth of rooms. Each of these may contain one of an enormous variety of monsters (which could kill you), treasure or artifacts (which will increase your wealth or magical and physical capabilities). Your aim is to collect as much treasure as possible by delving deeper and deeper into the maze...and staying alive!
