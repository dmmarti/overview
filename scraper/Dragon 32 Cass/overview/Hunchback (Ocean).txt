Hunchback was published by Ocean Software in 1984 for the Dragon 32, and it was a port from the original arcade version which was developed by Century Electronics in 1983. The game was also available on most of the other 8 bit micros available at the time. Each level of the game takes place on a Castle Wall and the player must control the hunchback across the screen from left to right whilst avoiding various obstacles in order to ring the bell at the far right of the screen. Successfully ringing the bell brings the player to the next level. Obstacles include fire pits which must be swung over on a long rope; castle ramparts which must be jumped across (some of which contain knights jutting spears at the Hunchback); flying fireballs and arrows. In addition, another knight attempts to climb up the castle wall to reach the hunchback. Eventually, after completing a number of levels, the player must rescue Esmeralda. If this final screen is completed, the game resets, sending the Hunchback back to the beginning to restart the game, but at a faster speed.
