Bandito is a simulation of a one-armed bandit, with some bells and whistles. Starting out with £1, you pay 10 pence for each pull at the bandit's arm. Depending on what comes up, you may be able to ”hold” some of the cylinders in order to increase chances of a winning combination. On some occasions, or when you get three lemons, you can ”nudge” the cylinders to piece together a winning line. Finally, it is possible to ”gamble” with your bonus, or to simply collect it as it is.
