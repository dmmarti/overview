In UXB the player is given the task of defusing an old unexploded war-time bomb. The game is menu based and played with keyboard. First the player has to choose the right items from his toolkit. Due to limited space in the vicinity of the bomb he can only carry six of these twelve items: small spanner, copper hammer, cold chisel, special fluid, sidecutters, stethoscope, socket set, pliers, hydraulic jack, special spanner, insulating tape and small screwdriver. If the player picks more than six items the bomb will go off right away. There is no way to dump an item so it's necessary to pick the right ones from the start. Before starting to work, the bomb can be examined from three views: side, nose and hatch.
