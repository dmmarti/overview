Scarfman is a derivative clone of the famous arcade classic Pac-Man for the TRS-80 platform. Its basic theme and function mirror the original game with various changes that are somewhat dictated by the TRS-80â€™s limited graphics and input. The player as in the original is to gobble down dots in the maze for points. You start at the bottom of the screen represented by a large C graphic. Moving during game play is done via cursor keys or joystick. Eat one of the large plus symbols and the five monsters change appearance. If you chomp the monsters now they are sent back to the top area of the screen. The game was produced on both cassette and disk media formats.
