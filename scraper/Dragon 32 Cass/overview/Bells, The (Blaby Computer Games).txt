Written by Drew Marshall, this is a fairly close copy of Ocean/Century's arcade platformer, Hunchback. Your goal is to traverse each screen filled with perils, so that you may reach the bell that is placed on the right side. Your bell-ringer has two different jumps. One is for jumping up in the air, so that you can avoid projectiles, and the other one is a long jump for bridging gaps. Each screen must be crossed within a short amount of time, or Quasimodo will be struck by lightning.
