In the year 6502 BC, Jesmon Hys from the city of Nodlon discovered the ancient Tombs of Ledromica in the rich pastures of Tatseclus. Over the years of exploring the Tombs, Jesmon has discovered apart from treasures, that somewhere deep in the Tombs is a Temple dedicated to the worship of Rah. Too old to search for the Temple, Jesmon has written down his findings for the person who discovers them to continue his search for the Temple.
