Transylvanian Tower is a single player maze game in which the player must explore five levels of Count Kreepie's castle, kill him, and find his stash of loot. The castle has over five hundred different rooms to explore. Some contain items that can be used but the inventory is limited to only three items at any one time, and this includes weapons, so it's wise to collect just what's important. The items/weapons available are: the golden ring, an invisible cloak, a magic apple, a special floor plan, a clove of garlic, a mirror, a knife, a dagger, a sword, a silver cross and your gun - which is limited to 10 shots. If the player is killed at any time on level 2 and beyond, the game is over and they are returned to the start of level one.
