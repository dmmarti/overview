You play a man named Duke, the son of Count Wein of Neugier. Long time ago, Duke was exiled from the country by his father. Traveling in faraway lands, Duke heard that his homeland was under attack. He decided to return to Neugier. On the way his ship was attacked by pirates, lead by a mysterious demon named Ord. After he barely escaped the ship, Duke found his way into his father's castle. He realized now that the pirates' attack and the monsters roaming the castle are connected. Although his father doesn't trust him, Duke is determined to save Neugier."Neugier" is an action adventure game in which you fight enemies in real-time, slashing them with your melee weapon. You have a "throw chain" ability, which allows you to press objects to the walls, destroying them. You can also push enemies to the walls this way. Duke can also jump and equip armor you find sometimes in dungeons.
