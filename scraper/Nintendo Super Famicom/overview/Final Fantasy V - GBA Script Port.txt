As the name implies, this hack is a complete port of the English GBA game’s script over the original RPGe fan translation, using Noisecross’ FFe Text Editor v1.6. This hack replaces all in-game field text, battle text, spell names, item names, monster names etc. with their relevant GBA equivalents, except where compromises had to be made to accommodate the stricter space limitations of the SNES game.These patches are small convenience enhancements for Final Fantasy 5. They ensure that the “Sprint” (or “Dash”) and “Learning” abilities are always considered active, allowing you to devote your precious ability slots to other things.
