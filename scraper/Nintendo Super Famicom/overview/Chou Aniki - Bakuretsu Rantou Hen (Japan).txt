The Cho Aniki series makes it's debut on the SNES with all of it's homo-erotic, pseudo humorous, bizarre, sweaty bodybuilding charm, but with one major gameplay change. Instead of being another side-scrolling shooter, Bakuretsu Rantouden is actually a one-on-one 2D fighter a la Street Fighter in which the most recognizable characters from the Cho Aniki series (yes the speedo wearing bodybuilders included) fight each other for ultimate supremacy using special attacks and moves. 
 
An interesting feature is that the game honors it's shooter roots, therefore instead of being restricted to walking backwards and forwards in the 2D plane and jumping around as in other fighting games, in this game all the characters can fly meaning the fights actually occur in mid-air allowing the players to dash all over the screen. Includes single player and 2-player vs modes.
