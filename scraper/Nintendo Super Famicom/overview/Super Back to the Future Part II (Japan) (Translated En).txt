A Japanese-only platform game where you control an anime-like Marty through Hill Valley. 
 
There are multiple stages, set across different time zones (present, future and past) where you hover-skate later on. 
You will encounter bosses like Griff, Biff and the corrupt Biff. 
 
Manically portrayed versions of Doc and Griff can also be found (see password entry screen).
