Dear Boys is a 1994 Super Famicom basketball game based on the manga of the same name. The game features both a story mode, which follows the plot of the manga, and an exhibition mode that allows the player to go straight into a match. 
 
The game features a "dramatic" perspective that is also slightly turn-based, similar to the Captain Tsubasa games. A window demonstrates what is happening - a ball is passed, a shot is thrown, the tip-off - in dramatic comic book style that is reminiscent of the manga. While a player's athlete has the ball, the player can pull up a menu that allows them to choose to pass, shoot or look at the present characters stats - each character has their own strengths and weaknesses that the player should keep in mind.
