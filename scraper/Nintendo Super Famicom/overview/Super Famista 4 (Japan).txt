Super Famista 2 is the sequel to Super Famista/Super Batter Up and part of the larger Famista (Family Stadium) series of baseball sims from Namco. Like its precursor, it has both an exhibition mode and a league mode, as well as options to customize a team. As with every Famista game prior, the athletes are presented as super deformed and the batting/pitching view is from directly behind the batter.
