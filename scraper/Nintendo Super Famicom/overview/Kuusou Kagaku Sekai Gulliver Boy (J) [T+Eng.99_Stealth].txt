Spain is trying to take over Europe, and Judo, prince of Spain or something, killed Gulliver’s father. Now Gulliver’s pissed off and wants revenge. Who wouldn’t? And so you set off to kick ass with nothing but Edison’s bombs, Gulliver’s hadouken thing, and Gulliver’s gigantic hair. Misty eventually joins you, but ends up being dead weight at first :P Oh, and in the second part of the game, you get this badass mech thing for all of two or three boss battles.
