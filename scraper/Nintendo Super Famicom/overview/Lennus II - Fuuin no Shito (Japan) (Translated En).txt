This is a follow-up to the game "Lennus", which is know outside of Japan as  Paladin's Quest. The game is set in a world of Andell - a floating continent where ancient prophecies and highly advanced technology co-exist. A curse has fallen onto Andell - its four island, once united, are now separated, and are floating away from the heart of the continent, the temple of Andell. The sages of the temple summon a great hero named Farse, who must find a special magic orb for each one of the islands, which is the only way to re-unite them. Farse embarks on his journey, aided by three Terranos, the big-eared inhabitants of Andell. 
 
This is a console-style RPG where you control a party containing the main hero Farse and three Terranos you select out of the available five. You encounter random enemies and bosses and fight them in turn-based combat viewed from first-person perspective. You can use special attacks and magical spells, which don't consume magic points, but take away a certain amount of your hit points. Instead of healing items, you have mini-bottles you can refill with potions in special places in towns. You can equip various magical artifacts which will allow you to use magic spells belonging to eight different elements.
