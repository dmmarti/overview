Cross Dimension 0079 uses an unorthodox system of tactical roleplaying. It sets the player with a number of mobile suits varying from one to three. In the early game the player controls only the Gundam. As the game progresses the player is allowed access to the Gundam, Guncannon and Guntank. In the late game (as the game follows the MS: Gundam film story) the player controls the Gundam and two Guncannons. Finally in the late game the player controls the RX-78XX Gundam Pixie along with two Guncannons.
