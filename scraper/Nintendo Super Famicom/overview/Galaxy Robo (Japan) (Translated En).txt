GALAXY ROBO IS A SCI-FI STRATEGY GAME FROM COPYA SYSTEM AND IMAGINEER. THE PLAYER DIRECTS A GROUP OF MECH PILOTS, EACH RIDING DISTINCTIVE BI-PEDAL SUITS AND OTHER VEHICLES. THE GAME IS STRUCTURALLY SIMILAR TO FIRE EMBLEM: THE PLAYER MOVES ALL THEIR UNITS FOR THEIR TURN, EITHER FIGHTING ENEMY UNITS OR PERFORMING OTHER TASKS, AND THEN CONTROL SWITCHES TO THE OPPONENT. WHEN TWO UNITS MEET IN COMBAT, A CUTAWAY CUTSCENE SHOWS THE AGGRESSOR LANDING (OR MISSING) A HIT, AND THE UNIT STATISTICS UNDERNEATH TELL THE PLAYER HOW MUCH DAMAGE WAS CAUSED.THE GAME WAS A JAPANESE EXCLUSIVE. IT WAS ONE OF A HANDFUL OF GAMES TO USE THE SNES MOUSE PERIPHERAL.
