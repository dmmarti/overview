Kinnikuman: Dirty Challenger is a wrestling game based in the Kinnikuman (or Muscleman, as it's known in other countries) anime series. The game encompasses the "Survivor Match for the Kinniku Throne" saga, which started just after the "Dream Chojin Tag Team Chapter" ended. 
 
In this game you will be able to choose among 6 relevant characters of the aforementioned saga, including the enemies of Kinnikuman. Combats will be 1 vs 1 and you will be able to execute a repertory of man to man acrobatic tactics, and of course, all combats will end either with a countdown or a surrender of one of the combatants.
