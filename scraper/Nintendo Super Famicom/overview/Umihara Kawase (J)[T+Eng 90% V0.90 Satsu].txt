Umihara Kawase is an unusual platformer featuring a girl that is captured in a bizarre dream world full of walking fish. Equipped with a fishing line she can swing and abseil from platform to platform using it as a grappling hook. The game's specialty is the detailed physics system that allows Kawase to perform various tricks using the elastic and length variable rope to move around the levels. There are almost 50 fields (levels) but most have multiple exits that allow you to play through the game on different paths without playing every single field in order. You can also record a good game and save it to watch it again at a later time.
