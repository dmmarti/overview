Ultra Baseball Jitsumeiban is the third game in the Ultra Baseball (Baseball Simulator in the USA) series. It was released in 1992 for the Super Famicom by Culture Brain exclusively in Japan. The game remains much the same as the previous 1991 Super Baseball Simulator 1.000 with some new additions. This title included real life players from the NPB league; the word Jitsumeiban means Real Player Version. Additionally a World Series championship and an All-Stars option was added to this version.In the game, there are three leagues: Central, Pacific and Ultra. Each league has six teams. In the Ultra League, pitchers and batters have special power-ups that boost their abilities which gives the game a surrealistic feel that is rare in the sports genre. Players can even create their own baseball teams and assign special moves to the players that they name themselves. The game can be played in exhibition, season or All-Stars modes.Though the game was never released worldwide, an unofficial English translation was created by VX Translations
