American Battle Dome for Super Famicom, by Tsukuda Original. It looks pretty great as a video game ? just a sort of four-player pinball thing, like a pinball version of Warlords or something. 
 
It?s based on a real Crossfire-esque board game ? which I?d never heard of, but looks completely badass. I assumed the board game never came out in Japan, hence the ?American? in the Super Famicom title, but nope: the board game was released with the same title, with a cute little face on the top!
