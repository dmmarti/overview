Kidou Senshi V Gundam recounts the events of the show, from Uso's first battle on Earth to the destruction of the Angel Halo. The story is told in occasionally animated cutscenes between combat. In battle Uso pilots the Victory Gundam and, later in the game, the V2 Gundam. The gundam is equipped with either three rifles, a beam saber, and a head mounted vulcan gun, or, in some space levels, with a chargeable beam rifle, a vulcan cannon, and the same 3 rifles. The goal of each encounter is to destroy any enemy MS that appear onscreen.
