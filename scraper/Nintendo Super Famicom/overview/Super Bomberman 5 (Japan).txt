The fifth and final Bomberman released for the SNES (so far).  This game is very similar to Super Bomberman 3 and 4.  Again there is a new story and new battle arenas but other than that it is the same game.  Players choose between the bosses of the story game levels in battle games like in Super Bomberman 4 yet they have not special powers this time around.
