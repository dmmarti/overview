Another tournament rocks the streets around the Nekketsu High area, and you know Kunio and his gang aren't going to let an opportunity to prove how baddass they are pass them by. 
 
The tournament this time is an eating contest, and the game itself plays like a block-lining puzzle game in the grand tradition of Tetris and Puyo Puyo. You must line-up blocks of the same type as they fall in the classic rectangular play area, clearing them before time runs up or they fill the entire screen. Features a 1P tournament mode, and a 2P competitive Vs mode in which you can chain blocks and send them to your opponent as "attacks" in hopes of causing him/her to lose.
