	<path>./Acrobat Mission (Japan).zip</path>
	<name>Acrobat Mission</name>
	<desc>Years ago humanity abandoned the over-polluted Earth to make a new home on Mars. Now, without warning, a mechanical moon has appeared in the skies over Mars, and is raining down destruction on the colonies. A plan is hastily put into action to destroy the moon and its armada of space-craft. Due to the impossible task of surviving a direct assault, the mission is code-named Acrobat Mission.

Your spaceship in Acrobat Mission is capable of firing a single straight ahead shot. By picking up a Wide upgrade, more shots are added that fly off at an angle, and the shot can be charged up to unleash a continuous short range cone of energy. Picking up a Hurricane upgrade will cause bullets to circle you defensively before shooting forward, and charging will store a full round of bullets up to be fired straight ahead all at once. Up to two bombs can be held at once, and if an enemy bullet hits a bomb it will detonate, saving your ship from damage. If your ship is hit, however, then you will have a few seconds to ram it into whatever shot you and take them down with you. Unlike most scrolling shooter games contact with an enemy ship will not kill you, but they can still push you into the path of bullets.

Play takes place over five levels, first of your launch on Mars, then the approach to the moon, and finally infiltrating the base to destroy its core. Each level ends with a unique boss except stage 4, which ends with 3 bosses.</desc>

	<name>Alcahest</name>
	<desc>Past and future are connected in a way mortals do not understand...  A star was glowing up in the sky, and the demon god Alcahest appeared, bringing chaos and destruction to the world. A single swordsman stood in defiance. The four powers that protect the world, the Guardians, gave him their power, and with it the swordsman slew the demon and restored peace in the world. 

Thousand years have passed. And a new battle is already on the way. A cruel emperor leads his troops towards conquest. The kingdom of Panakeia is defending itself with the aid of its knights. Once again, the ominous star shines in the sky, indicating the demon's revival. With the help of Alcahest's power, the evil emperor wants to conquer the world. But the new generation also brings the new hero - the brave swordsman Alen. Aided by the Guardians, Alen must stop the Empire's evil plans and to destroy Alcahest once again.

This is an action game with RPG elements. You wander around slaying enemies in real time combat, gathering treasure on the way, and occasionally participating in boss battles. When you gather enough experience from fighting, you gain extra hit points. You can also upgrade your weapons. On the way you'll meet some characters who will join your party for short time, and you'll be able to use their special attacks and magic.</desc>

Alliances are made, forming two major sides: The Axis and The Federation.  The elite units in these wars are Assault Suits, man-piloted combat mechs called Assault Suits.  Jake is one such pilot, drafted into the Pacific States' Marine Corp under the Federation. During his training, the war has grown substantially and upon being assigned to a platoon, he is immediately thrown into combat.

Cybernator is a side scrolling mech combat game and platform game. The player controls Jake as he moves his assault suit left and right on the battlefield. The assault suit can jump and use a jetpack for a short time to increase altitude. The assault suit begins with a Shot machine gun weapon that spreads out fire in front, and a Punch weapon for close melee. Additional weapons can be found during the course of the game and existing weapons improved by the gathering of "P" power-ups, left by defeated enemy. Each level contains a variety of enemies and an end boss which must be destroyed to reach the next level. Some levels take place as horizontally scrolling shooters, in which the Assault suit can move up, down, left and right on the screen... but is constantly advancing towards new threats.</desc>

The king sends his best troops of knights and wizards to face the enemy, but in vain - the kingdom is conquered by Sauzer, the king is murdered, and his lovely daughter is kidnapped. You were brave, Leader of the Dragon Squad, but now you will have to become strong. Remember the promise you gave the princess long time ago: always to be at her side. Supported by his friends and by his faithful dragons, you must now free the princess and the kingdom from the enemy's hands. If only the strongest of the dragons, Bahamut, could be awakened...

Bahamut Lagoon, created by the company which gave us the Final Fantasy games, is a mixture of turn-based strategy and RPG. Control several parties of four characters each, and command different dragons at once. The battles start on a top-down screen typical for strategy games, but often switch to a dynamic "platform" view, such as used in early console RPGs. You also can influence the game by other strategic activities, such as, for example, setting a whole forest on fire, to prevent enemies to come through it.</desc>

The goal is to sneak up behind the opponent and shoot them before they can reciprocate. Various power-ups may appear after destructible blocks are removed, which can give the player an edge or, in the case of the ? icon, a possible random negative effect like reversed controls. There are also wandering monsters that can cause damage to anyone they come in contact with. Every combatant has a health bar which depletes at a rate dependent on the attacks they are getting hit by.

The single-player mode involves fighting through various worlds and removing all enemy combatants from the field to progress.</desc>

	<desc>In this game, you're either in the foreground or the background, and your opponent is always on the opposite end of the screen. To fight whoever flies thar yonder in the distance, you send out projectiles, in our case fireballs. These behave differently depending on which of the four main buttons you press: if you press the A button, they fly in a curve towards the upper right part of the screen, if you push the Y button, they go left and down and so on and so forth. Sadly, they move so slowly your opponent has a good three seconds to get out of the way, and in so weird curves that aiming is impossible. Also, the screen constantly twists in all directions.</desc>

	<name>Battle Jockey</name>
	<desc>Battle Jockey is a racing game for up to four players that was developed by Nova and published by Virgin Interactive exclusively in Japan for the Super Famicom.It features horseracing, a far more popular pastime in Japan than elsewhere, and presents three separate modes: the first is the standard single-player story mode, in which the player takes a horse and jockey through training and races; the second is a battle mode which pits up to four players against each other in races that have far more power-ups and other unusual additions to the game's courses; and the third is a passive gambling mode in which the player puts money down on horses depending on their odds of winning and subsequent payouts and then watches the race play out with CPU players.The standard mode involves carefully managing the horse's stamina: being too aggressive will cause it to rear up in protest. Falling behind or running into a hedge or jump will cause the horse to lose stamina, and losing all stamina causes it to collapse briefly. The player needs to keep a steady pace, steer carefully around corners, jump at the right times and use the boost sparingly in order to win. In the battle mode stamina is less of a concern and the game more resembles RC Pro-Am: the players have to simply follow the course and avoid the dangers as they show up.</desc>

	<path>./Bishoujo Senshi Sailor Moon - Another Story (Japan) (Translated En).zip</path>
	<name>Sailor Moon : Another Story</name>
	<desc>The game is based on the Japanese manga and animé series Bishoujo Senshi: Sailor Moon - "Bishoujo Senshi" roughly meaning "Pretty Young Girl Warrior". It is set in the 30th century, in a futuristic city Crystal Tokyo. In this city lives a totally ordinary (at first) fourteen-year old girl Usagi. When she meets a magical cat named Luna, she finds out that she is in fact a princess sent to the future in order to fight the minions of Darkness. She discovers within herself the power to transform into the hero of darkness, Sailor Moon, meets other warriors who help her on her quest, and fights the evil Queen Beryl, hostile aliens, and other foes.

The events of this game take place shortly after Bishoujo Senshi Sailor Moon S, the fourth volume of the long-running series. A global peace is established in the universe, but lately suspicious things are happening. A strange meteorite is seen approaching the Earth. Street gangs and spies who work for a mysterious person called Apsu are seen in Crystal Tokyo. And the Mystic Silver Crystal, the Ginzuishou, which protects the city, is shaking! Usagi and her friends must now investigate the strange events and face the forces of Darkness once again.

The game is a console-style RPG in Final Fantasy style (battles with your party to the right and the enemies to the left), with a battle system somewhat similar to that of Chrono Trigger: you must form a party out of several available characters, make them participate in battles together, and learn powerful combo attacks.

Luna, a magical talking cat, contacts her and tells her she is in fact a Sailor Moon, one of the legendary Pretty Fighters - girls who fight the forces of darkness and protect the Kingdom of Moon. 

The game is based on the events of the animé that follow the victory of Usagi and her friends over the Queen Beryl. Peace has returned to the Moon Kingdom. But suddenly, a little girl named Chibiusa arrives from the future and says the future kingdom is threatened by the forces of the evil Prince Diamond. Looks like you are the only ones who can defeat him, and save the future Sailor Moon, Chibiusa's mother.

This is a beat-'em up game. You can play as either Usagi or any of her girlfriends, including Chibiusa. You move on a platform and fight the enemies by punching, kicking, and throwing them, and by using special abilities unique to each character. You can advance only after you have cleared an area from enemies.

	<name>Sailor Moon S : Kondo wa Puzzle de Oshioki yo</name>
	<desc>Bishoujo Senshi Sailor Moon S: Kondoha Puzzle de Oshiokiyo is a falling block competitive puzzle game. Players begin by choosing from a selection of Sailor Moon licensed characters, each with a unique special attack. The player is presented with a board filled with colored blocks in three colors: red, blue and green. The goal is to remove all the blocks from play. Clicking on a block that touches several adjacent blocks of the same color will remove them all from play. As each player successfully clears blocks, they drop "black blocks" on their opponent as well as increase their power bar. Black blocks cannot be removed by normal means and disappear only when large ammounts of blocks are removed adjacent to them. As the power bar charges, players can unleash their special ability, often an attack on the other player.

This puzzle game is based on the "S" series of Sailor Moon and includes characters from there: Sailor Moon, Sailor Mars, Sailor Venus, Sailor Mercury, Sailor Jupiter, Chibiusa, Tuxedo Mask, Sailor Uranus, Sailor Neptune and Sailor Pluto.

	<name>Sailor Moon S : Kurukkurin</name>
	<desc>Bishoujo Senshi Sailor Moon S: Kurukkurin is a competitive puzzle game featuring Sailor Moon licensed characters. Upon choosing a character (each with unique "special moves"), the player competes against an opponent. Each player controls a grid of 10x6 sections (represented by hearts) initially made up of clear hearts. The player moves their cursor over the clear hearts to turn them into one of four colors: red, yellow, blue and green. Sometimes "treasures" will show up on the board. When several hearts of the same color are adjacent to one another, the player can clear them... which pushes all the hearts (and treasures) down towards the bottom. The goal is to be the player with the most treasures to end the round.

Sailor Moon characters featured are primarily from the "S" Series and includes: Sailor Moon, Sailor Mars, Sailor Mercury, Sailor Venus, Sailor Jupiter, Chibius, Tuxedo Mask, Sailor Neptune, Sailor Uranus and Sailor Pluto.

	<name>Bishoujo Senshi Sailor Moon Super S - Zenin Sanka!! Shuyaku Soudatsusen</name>
	<desc>The game is based on the manga/animÃ© series Sailor Moon. It tells the story of Pretty Sailor Fighters, teenage girls who were summoned to protect the futuristic Moon Kingdom and to fight the forces of darkness, led by the evil Queen Beryl and Prince Diamond. The main heroine is a girl named Tsukino Usagi, who was contacted by the magical talking cat Luna to become Sailor Moon, the leader of the group.

This fighting game is an enhanced version of Bishoujo Senshi Sailor Moon S: Jougai Ranto!? Shuyaku Soudatsusen. Girls compete against each other in tournament mode, story mode, player-vs.-computer mode, and two players mode. They can use physical attacks and magical spells. In story mode you can also upgrade your fighter's attributes (strength, defense power, etc.) New in this expanded version: additional playable characters (hence the title Zen'in Sanka - "Everyone Participates"), different scenes in story mode, additional backgrounds for battles.

	<name>Brandish 2 : The Planet Buster</name>
	<desc>The Planet Buster continues the story that was told in the first Brandish game, and depicts the events that happened three years after the evil demonic king was defeated in his lost kingdom, sunken deep underground. You take control of a young warrior named Ares, who wields a magical weapon, a powerful sword called the Planet Buster. One day, while traveling through a desert, Ares is captured by a warlock named Karl, who is after the powers hidden within the magical sword. Suspecting Ares might have some valuable information, Karl doesn't execute him, but takes away the Planet Buster and throws Ares into his underground prison. Now your primary goal is to guide Ares out of the huge prison full of various dangers, and to get your mighty weapon back.

The game is an action RPG with a heavy emphasis on dungeon crawling. You guide Ares through rotating dungeons, fighting enemies in real-time combat, casting spells, and solving an occasional puzzle. You have the ability to jump forwards and to attack inanimate objects such as doors to cause damage and to break the object.

It is the third game in the series, and the first for the Super Nintendo.

The game follows the story of the manga to some extent.Besides the obvious graphical upgrade moving from 8-bit to 16-bit, Koutei no Chousen now allows the player to see a map of the pitch to help them strategize.</desc>

	<name>Captain Tsubasa J</name>
	<desc>A 1995 Japan-exclusive Captain Tsubasa video game developed and published by Bandai and was the final Captain Tsubasa game for the Super Famicom.
This game suffered lots of changes from previous games made by Tecmo, this time you will be playing in a real soccer field and in real time, which means that you need to press certain keys even without having the chance of stopping the time (like in previous games), When a certain player is confronted with a one that he considers his rival (like Misugi and Schneider or Tsubasa and *any other player*, for example) they will have a fight, which is mainly a button smashing sequence. The same goes for the sequence in which a goalkeeper tries to stop any of the special shots.
This game has almost the same story as the Captain Tsubasa J anime, except that this one will finish with a special match against an extra team. So, you'll play across various chapters, playing with Aoi Shingo in Italy or controlling the mythic Ozora Tsubasa in his match against the brazillian prodigy, Carlos Santana (nope, he isn't the singer). You'll also play with Japan national team against the same opponents as they did in the anime version..</desc>

The game would then be available for sale shortly before or after the competition, which helped raise its profile.</desc>

	<desc>CB Chara Wars, sometimes written with the subtitle Ushinawareta Gag, is an RPG that features a crossover of sorts of Go Nagai's various manga franchises. These include Devilman and Mazinger Z, among others. The "CB" in the title refers to the term "chibi", which depicts characters as smaller and cuter than usual. In that sense, it is similar to the term SD (super deformation) found in several Super Famicokm Gundam game titles.CB Chara Wars began as an original video animation which first aired in 1991. A manga adaptation followed the following year, as did this game. Banpresto published the game in Japan, a company known for creating games with anime crossovers such as the Super Robot Taisen/Wars series.</desc>

	<name>Chinhai</name>
	<desc>Chinhai is a puzzle game for the Super Famicom and a variant on Mahjong Solitaire, or Shanghai. Instead of pairing and removing any two tiles that match as long as one of their sides is clear, as is the case in Shanghai, the rules of Chinhai require that the two tiles can only be removed if it's possible to draw a line between the two that doesn't make a 90 degree turn more than twice. Two tiles on opposite sides of the board, for instance, can't be paired because it would take three 90 degree turns to draw a line between them. To account for this added difficulty, the game lacks the "stacks" of tiles that frequently appear in Shanghai, instead presenting a flat board of tiles.Chinhai is named for the municipality of Chinhai in China, maintaining the theme of naming mahjong solitaire variants after territories in China. Chinhai has long since been renamed Zhenhai, which is situated in the Ningpo Prefecture and now part of a much larger city. This mahjong solitaire variant is perhaps best known as Sichuan or Shisenshou, also named for a province in China.</desc>

	<desc>The Cho Aniki series makes it's debut on the SNES with all of it's homo-erotic, pseudo humorous, bizarre, sweaty bodybuilding charm, but with one major gameplay change. Instead of being another side-scrolling shooter, Bakuretsu Rantouden is actually a one-on-one 2D fighter a la Street Fighter in which the most recognizable characters from the Cho Aniki series (yes the speedo wearing bodybuilders included) fight each other for ultimate supremacy using special attacks and moves.

An interesting feature is that the game honors it's shooter roots, therefore instead of being restricted to walking backwards and forwards in the 2D plane and jumping around as in other fighting games, in this game all the characters can fly meaning the fights actually occur in mid-air allowing the players to dash all over the screen. Includes single player and 2-player vs modes.

	<desc>?In this sidescrolling action-platformer, Bonk is once again trying to save his world from the evil clutches of the reptilian king, who once more is threatening the prehistoric era.  Boy, you'd think that after being defeated four times prior that he would take a hint.  This time, you also get to face his five best soldiers, who will try to stop you in your tracks.  Bonk controls rather smoothly, and he is really fun to control.  To those of you that are not familiar with the series, Bonk is a caveman who attacks his enemies with his noggin; after jumping down, from below, while swimming, and while in the air.  He can even bounce off walls with his head, skip on the water like a stone if his head is facing down, climb certain walls with his teeth, scale up waterfalls, flip in the air (so long as the attack button is repeatedly being tapped), and so forth.  As is the case with the series, you start with a regular amount of health, but if you find a translucent heart icon, you'll increase your capacity.  What's neat is how collecting the food not only scores you some points but how it also replenishes a little bit of your health, too.  This time Bonk can also run if you hold down the A button, and the X button is used if you have a special ability on you.  If you find a power-up, whether it be piece of meat, or a different icon, then you will be given a power-up ability that will be taken out the moment you're hit once (damn).  Among the power-ups are the one where the fire will be spreading if Bonk hits his head on the ground (you know, the one where he looks freaky), one where Bonk turns into a bird and gains the ability to fly, one where Bonk becomes tiny and can make platforms made out of Japanese characters, and there is one where Bonk has the ability to double-jump as a girl.  Yes, Bonk becomes a girl if he eats the pink-colored meat.  I'm dead serious.</desc>

	<name>Choujikuu Yousai Macross : Scrambled Valkyrie</name>
	<desc>The legend of the Valkyrie pilots is not yet over. Hikaru, Max, and Millia take flight to defend the earth from Zentraedi, robots, more robots, and giant space crab-bees. Now is the time to scramble Valkyrie again. 

When starting a game or continuing the player picks from either Hikaru, Max, or Millia. Each flies a custom Valkyrie with its own set weapon load-out. A Valkyrie changes its weapon and movement speed by switching between its three forms: Fighter, Gerwalk, and Battroid. Typically the Valkyrie weapon shoots straight and quickly, the Gerwalk weapon shoots around or through obstacles, and the Battroid weapon does higher damage in exchange for reduced firing rate. Each weapon can be upgraded up to twice by picking up power up items dropped by special enemy ships, but one level of power up will be lost any time the Valkyrie is shot. If a Valkyrie's entire life bar is depleted then the full stage must be repeated, provided the player still has enough continues.

In a nod to Galaga the player is able to capture some enemy craft to increase their firepower. If the player does not shoot any weapons for a few seconds a field of electricity will cover the Valkyrie. Touching some enemy ships will then cause their targeting to be shorted out and make them friendly to the player, following along and shooting or ramming onscreen enemies.

	<name>Chou Mahou Tairiku Wozz </name>
	<desc>The magic world of Wozz, populated by magicians, alchemists, and other kinds of people - including simple town and village inhabitants - was a seemingly peaceful place, until one day, a poisonous rain started turning its inhabitants into monsters. The chief wizard realizes that the demon Balaam is trying to link the world of Wozz with the world of humans. Only a human hero can stop Balaam, and the wizard's teleporting magic brings... three young humans: the Japanese girl Reona Kitazato, and two boys: the American Shot Phoenix and the Chinese Chun Chingtao. Will those youngsters be able to stop Balaam?

The game is a traditional console-style RPG similar to Breath of Fire: turn-based battles are viewed from an isometric perspective. You control all three characters as a party, but in the beginning of the game you choose one of them as the main character, and therefore will see the game from his/her perspective. In case the characters split up, you'll be able to control only the one you chose.

	<name>Cosmo Gang - The Puzzle</name>
	<desc>Cosmo Gang: The Puzzle is a puzzle game from Namco and the second game to feature their Cosmo Gang characters. The Cosmo Gang were originally attached to a group of redemption games (like pachinko or claw machines) from Namco, but would eventually star in two Arcade games: Cosmo Gang: The Video, a Galaga clone, and Cosmo Gang: The Puzzle.

This game would become the basis of Namco's more well-known puzzle game Pac-Attack, featuring Pac-Man. As with Pac-Attack, the idea is to stack up a lot of the animated face icons (members of the Cosmo Gang) in an unbroken chain and then drop a bomb (shaped like an arrow) that goes down the chain and eliminates them all at once.</desc>

The Cosmo Gang are based on a series of characters that had previously been used by Namco for a redemption game (a type of Arcade machine that dispenses award tokens for winning a rudimentary game, of which pachinko is the most popular variant) the previous year. The subtitle suggests that this is their video game debut. Originally released in the Arcades, Cosmo Gang: The Video was later ported to the Super Famicom.</desc>

	<desc>Once again the universe is at peril from invaders from beyond, but this time their target is Earth! Galivan and company don't have time to find items or level up weapons as in Galivan's previous outing; this is a no holds barred slugfest. Three characters are playable, each with varying stats but basically the same moveset. Each character has a standard straight ahead punch or kick, a sweeping kick, an uppercut, and a ranged attack that must be charged up. At the start of the game and the end of every level the player can add stat points to their character to increase their HP, defense, jump height, and strength of normal and special attacks.

A 2 player versus mode is included as well. Both players can choose from the three main characters, and the second player can additionally choose from one of the four normal enemy types.</desc>

	<name>Crayon Shin Chan</name>
	<desc>Five-year-old Shinnosuke Nohara is the epitome of noisy children: loud and inappropriate, infuriating to his parents, and hilarious to onlookers. Shin-chan is always getting in trouble with his parents and saying bizarre or offensive things to everyone he meets. Every so often, though, he'll try to do what his mom wants him to, but more often than not, he'll misunderstand and simply confound his parents further.

Arashi o Yobu Enji ("A Kindergartner Called Tempest") is one of many games based on the manga and anime created by Yoshito Usui. In four stages, each made up of five areas, Shin-chan must explore his neighborhood looking for a specific object. He can enter houses to ask people for information, but will often end up simply insulting them. He must also avoid or knock over the other children in the neighborhood, and has various ability cards that he can use to assist him, which might give him a water pistol or refill his health. After finding what he's looking for, Shin-chan will move on to the next area.

Also included is a minigame mode with eight different minigames, such as a bubble-blowing contest, a three-legged race, and a desperate search for clothing before school. The entire game, including the minigames, is filled with dialogue containing the same humor as the source material.

	<desc>Crayon Shin-Chan 2: Dai Maou no Gyakushu ("Crayon Shin-Chan 2: The Demon Lord's Counterattack") is a platformer based on the Crayon Shin-Chan anime and manga. The player, as the mischievous kindergartner Shin-chan, must rescue his favorite super hero Action Kamen ("Action Mask") from his prison before Action Kamen's supervillain nemesis Haiguremaou can take over both Action Kamen's and Shin-chan's worlds. Many of the bosses are transformed versions of Shin-chan's friends and family.

The game is a standard side-scrolling 2D platformer - common with licensed games - though it is notable for letting players decide which order they want to tackle stages, not to mention the franchise's penchant for weird/gross-out humor.</desc>

	<desc>There was once a prosperous kingdom, a peaceful kingdom, ruled by a wise old king, where all peopled lived happily together, protected by the power of a magical crystal. But one day, several dark clouds appeared over the kingdom and poured down a devastating rain. And then one of the clouds turned into a demon, and, reaching its hands to the treasure room in the palace, took the crystal away. The demon lord, still in a form of a menacing dark cloud, started spawning monsters and sending them to attack the now helpless kingdom. The king called to the heavens for help. Eight magical weapons fell on the ground, and eight warriors rose to protect their country. Your task now is to cleanse the land of the monsters and to defeat the evil demon lord.

"Crystal Beans" is an action RPG based on fighting and dungeon crawling. You can play as either of the eight initial character classes: Fighter, Warrior, Bow-man, Wizard, Priest, Kage (a kind of a ninja), Monk, or Witch. In addition, there are four secret classes you discover during your journey. Each class has its own strength and weaknesses, and two unique attack types.</desc>

	<name>Cu-On-Pa SFC</name>
	<desc>Cu-On-Pa SFC is the Super Famicom version of Cu-On-Pa.Cu-On-Pa is an original puzzle game that was developed by a little-known group called Onesong Partners. This group originally released an obscure game similar to this but with a wider audience in mind, various enhancements and alternate modes for PCs called "Endorfun" in 1995 in the U.S and Europe.Japanese developers seemed to like the concept and got permission to make something like it based on the original principals of Endorfun for the obscure Satellaview (or BS-X) and then later as a standalone release for the Super Famicom, where the game was called BS Cu-On-Pa and Cu-On-Pa, respectively. It would also get released later for Playstation.Published by T&amp;E Soft for the SFC late in 1996, Cu-On-Pa was also fan-translated sometime later for the emulation community, though the game comes with a rather straightforward tutorial and the game is very easy to understand, but difficult to master. This game is difficult to describe and in a league of its own.You play as a three-dimensional cube that must destroy all the "Life Panels" on a level. To do so, you have to rotate your cube and roll over the colored squares on the transparent field. Panels come in a variety of colors and the main way to elimate them is by having the color on the top of the cube match the color of the tile beneath you.The other way is for more skilled players and comes in the form of "Lightning Panels", which are generated when you destroy panels other than Life Panels. Destroy enough of them and you'll have lots of them. Then go and destroy a life panel! What will happen is, all lightning panels will explode that match the color of the life panel you rolled over. Moreover, the explosion spreads and detonates other tiles in the vicinity, which can spread and create a chain reaction. It's up to you how you wish to rack up points, either by time, chains, or both.Ken Kojima was the music composer.</desc>

	<name>Cyber Knight</name>
	<desc>In the 24th century, mankind has gone into space. The crew of the starship Swordfish are in an engagement with space pirates when the battle takes a turn for the worse. In desperation, the crew activate their jump drive without a destination... and end up flung across the galaxy to the galactic core. The Swordfish however is badly damaged with many casualties including the captain. Only 26 of the crew survive, and of them only 6 are qualified for combat: The commander, two soldiers, a mechanic and a doctor and six giant "Module" mechanized suits available for them. These survivors locate planet Farworld, apparently colonized by humans. There they discover the colony is under attack by a relentless mechanical aliens dubbed "Berserkers". The crew of the swordfish must fight back against the Berserkers and explore the galaxy for some means to return home.

Cyber Knight is an RPG with a science-fiction theme of being lost in an alien galaxy. The game takes place in a top-down view for movement on planets and areas, a side-view for combat sequences and a first person menu system when aboard the Swordfish starship. The Swordfish can travel between stars, scanning worlds for information. If the ship is able to land on a planet, three crew members piloting three Modules (giant robots) can be selected to debark and explore the planet. Many planets will have towns or people living on them which can be talked to in order to uncover information. Different quests are assigned in order to find the items necessary to progress. There is no system of currency or buying items. Instead, many defeated Berserkers leave behind "NeoParts", which can be brought back to the Swordfish's lab. Analysis of these Neo parts unlocks enhances statistics (endurance, agility, accuracy, etc) for the Modules and new weapons for them to carry. The six modules are unique in statistics, and also the six pilots each carry different skills.

Combat takes place in turn-based combat on a 6x6 squares field. Seen from the side view, the three modules can be positioned in relation to enemies in order to attack, using a variety of melee and long-ranged weaponry. Ammunition is unlimited, but each module also carries a number of "options" that are consumable attacks. Each Module has two sets of hitpoints: one for the pilot and one for the module itself. If either one of these reaches zero, the module is destroyed. In order to heal, the party carries 10 each of repair kits and first aid kits, which must when not in combat. These kits, as well as options and defeated pilots or modules can be restored by returning to the Swordfish.</desc>

	<desc>Following the events of the first Cyber Knight in the 24th century, the crew of the Swordfish have returned to Earth after defeating the mechanical "Berzerkers" far across space. However during their time away, the Earth Federation has been taken over by the ambitious General Forrest, who seeks to wage war on the independent systems and conquer them. Recognizing the potential weapons that could be made from the Berzerker science data, Forrest impounds the Swordfish and jails it's crew. The Berzerker data is used to create "Overtech" and bring to life "Metalliforms", self-replicating war machines. The Swordfish crew manages to escape, thanks to a mysterious agent "CJ", and are recruited into the resistance against the Earth Federation. Given a new spaceship, the Galvodirge, they must travel the galaxy to different human civilizations and devise a plan to stop Earth's attack.

Cyber Knight II is an RPG with science-fiction themes. As in the first game, much of the game takes place in a top-down view for movement on planets and areas, a side-view for combat sequences and a first person menu system when aboard the Galvodirge starship. The Galvodirge can travel between stars, scanning worlds for information. If the ship is able to land on a planet, the crew can debark either on foot or using combat modules (mechs). Some areas are only accessible using modules and others (such as towns) do not allow the use of these war machines. Many planets will have towns or people living on them which can be talked to in order to uncover information. Different quests are assigned in order to find the items necessary to progress. There is no system of currency or buying items. Instead, many defeated enemies leave behind "NeoParts", which can be brought back to the Swordfish's lab. Analysis of these Neo parts unlocks enhances statistics (endurance, agility, accuracy, etc) for the Modules and new weapons for them to carry. 

The crew are divided into a three person "combat team" and a three person "support team". If modules are used, they can be assigned from the ship's hanger. Unlike the first game, modules only perform a combat or a support role, and each is unique in statistics and the type of weaponry it can carry. When combat occurs on the main map, the support team will often deliver the first strike by firing missiles into the enemies. When searching facilities, caves or other locations, the support team is not available. Following either case, the combat team engages the enemy in turn-based combat on a 6x6 squares field. Seen from the side view, the three modules can be positioned in relation to enemies in order to attack, using a variety of melee and long-ranged weaponry. Ammunition is unlimited, but each module also carries a number of "options" that are consumable attacks. Each Module has two sets of hitpoints: one for the pilot and one for the module itself. If either one of these reaches zero, the module is destroyed. In order to heal, the party carries 10 each of repair kits and first aid kits, which must when not in combat. These kits, as well as options and defeated pilots or modules can be restored by returning to the Galvodirge.</desc>

	<desc>Nine young people were turned into cyborgs by a company trying to take over the world. They have defeated this company and are now using their super powers to protect the world.

Based on the manga/anime by the same name, Cyborg 009 is a side-scrolling platformer in which the player takes control of 8 different cyborgs, using their special abilities to complete several missions. 

Their special abilities are as follows:
002 can fly and hover in the air; 003 can see in the dark; 004 can fire bullets from his fingers and rockets from his knees; 005 can break rocks with his fists; 006 can blow fire that also melts rocks; 007 can take on different shapes including those of enemies; 008 can swim underwater for extended periods of time; 009 can move at very high speeds. (001 is a baby and can't be taken on missions). Using these special abilities consumes SP that slowly regenerate. 

In addition to their special abilities, the cyborgs also have four attributes that govern their attack and defensive powers, their amount of SP and SP regeneration speed. 

Before every mission, one cyborg is assigned leader and two more can be selected by the player. Only one cyborg can be controlled at a time, but it is possible to switch between cyborgs at any time. All cyborgs share the same HP and SP-bar. Throughout the levels, experience points can be collected and used to increase a cyborg's attributes after a completed mission.</desc>

	<desc>Through the Light came the Darkness, and through the Darkness came the Light. They were inseparable in the beginning, and gave birth to each other. Rukyu appeared before all the other creatures, the great demon of darkness, later to be known as the Satan. The divine hero-god Roda went up to his dark realm to defeat him, but was struck down, and presumed dead. But the hero couldn't die so easily: he swore to defeat Rukyu once and for all. Meanwhile, Rukyu doesn't just stay in his realm, waiting for Roda: he goes out to the world as a death-bringing sorcerer, and he is out for Roda...

The game is quite different from most other RPGs, because it lets you play as both the "good" hero and the villain. The game is divided into chapters, and each chapter is played by either Roda or Rukyu. You switch the two heroes chapter-after-chapter, and lead them to their ultimate battle from two opposite sides. The entire game, including the battles, is viewed from an isometric perspective. The battles are random and turn-based, and the battle field is divided into squares you can position and move your characters on. Both Roda and Rukyu can have party members join them, and both attack mostly with magic. Rukyu uses a special energy called "Soul Power", while Roda cast one-time spells from scrolls he receives after battles.</desc>

	<name>Dark Law: The Meaning of Death</name>
	<desc>Three-hundred years ago, there were two kingdoms on the earth -Reyfore, ruled by the benevolent and mighty king Reynard, and Amugnon, ruled by king Daruk. The two kingdoms could have lived in peace, but pride took over king Daruk, he didn't respect the Goddess any more, and as a result his mind became obsessed by the idea of destruction. Daruk attacked Reyfore, and for decades war was embracing the two kingdoms, setting the Earth in flames. After a prolonged battle, king Reynard defeated king Daruk, and a reign of prosperity began once again.

But can evil be truly defeated? The hero of the game, a young adventurer, falls down from a cliff while taking a stroll near the ancient Sophia Temple. He is saved by an old man who lives with his daughter Refia in a small country house. But one day, a demonic-looking knight appears, accompanied by monsters, kills the old man, and kidnaps Refia. The old man recognized the knight - it was king Daruk! Now the hero must bring Refia back and defeat Daruk once and for all.

The game has a less linear structure than a standard console-style RPG: together with the main story there are many missions, or "scenarios", which are not obligatory to complete, but which occupy a large portion of the game. In the beginning of the game you create a party of four characters, the hero and his three companions. The battles are pre-determined and take place on the same screen as the gameworld itself. Your party and the enemies can move freely around the screen and attack with melee and ranged weapons, and their actions depend on the amount of action points they have. Navigation in town is menu-based.</desc>

	<desc>Dear Boys is a 1994 Super Famicom basketball game based on the manga of the same name. The game features both a story mode, which follows the plot of the manga, and an exhibition mode that allows the player to go straight into a match.

The game features a "dramatic" perspective that is also slightly turn-based, similar to the Captain Tsubasa games. A window demonstrates what is happening - a ball is passed, a shot is thrown, the tip-off - in dramatic comic book style that is reminiscent of the manga. While a player's athlete has the ball, the player can pull up a menu that allows them to choose to pass, shoot or look at the present characters stats - each character has their own strengths and weaknesses that the player should keep in mind.</desc>

	<name>Dharma Doujou</name>
	<desc>Dharma Doujou was originally released in the arcades by Metro3D in 1994 (picture on the left). While the original version provides the same gameplay as the Super Famicom version tested here, the game does have some noticeable differences. First of all, it has more enemies and features colorful backgrounds borrowed from traditional Japanese themes and myths (well, in the Korean version of the game, Metro3D apparently threw in a couple of bikini girls for good measure). Additionally, the arcade game only contains a story mode and there is no progress map or alternate game modes like in the Super Famicom port. But, most importantly, the gameplay is slightly different - the player has to move the character around the screen in order to hit a block with the mallet. The Super Famicon version, on the contrary, automatically aligns the player with the furthest most block, and this apparently minor difference makes the gameplay of the home conversion more fast-paced and enjoyable than the original.</desc>

	<name>Doraemon</name>
	<desc>The game is based on the animé series "Doraemon". Doraemon is a blue robotic cat who has the ability to enter dream world and to help the people who live there. In this game, Nobita, a bespectacled friend of Doraemon's, suddenly meets a little fairy. Long ago, humans and fairies lived together in peace, but since the humans started developing their technology, the fairies have no place any more. Nobita and Doraemon travel to the dream world to find out how can they help.

The game is divided into adventure and platform action modes. In adventure mode, you navigate Doraemon from a top-down view, talking to people and entering houses. When you have gathered enough information, a place on the map will be highlighted. If Doraemon (or other characters, later in the game) enters this place, a platform action section begins. In platform mode, Doraemon must overcome the obstacles and defeat enemies by jumping on them or by throwing magic dusk at them, in order to retrieve important items.

	<desc>The game is closely related to Doraemon: Nobita to Yosei no Kuni. It is based on the manga "Doraemon", that tells the story of a Japanese boy named Nobita, who always gets bullied by stronger kids in the school. In the future, his grandson uses a time machine and send the cat-like robot Doraemon to protect Nobita. In this adventure, Nobita, Doraemon, and their friends travel to the Toys Land. Some evil toys are threatening this country, and it's up to our heroes to help its inhabitants.

The game is divided into adventure and platform action modes. In adventure mode, Doraemon walks around towns, talking to people and entering houses. Key locations lead to platform levels, which must be completed to advance the story. Platform levels include plenty of obstacles (pits, spikes, self-destructing platforms etc.), as well as various enemies who try to stop the heroes. You can choose one of the six available characters to play through the platform level. They all can jump and defeat enemies either by jumping on their heads or by using long-ranged weapons.

Nobita's future grandson constructs a cat-like blue robot named Doraemon, and sends him to the past to protect Nobita. In this game, a friend of Nobita's finds a fossil.

This is an action platform game with adventure elements. You can control Doraemon, Nobita, and other characters, traveling through platform levels, defeating or avoiding enemies. Each character has his own weapon and possesses a special ability (for example, Suneo can crawl through narrow spaces, etc.) which is often required to complete a stage. In present time, you travel through Nobita's town in top down view, talking to characters and entering houses. There is also a slight RPG element in the game, as you can buy items and upgrade your weapons.

	<name>Do Re Mi Fantasy: Milon no DokiDoki Daibouken</name>
	<desc>A young boy named Milon sets off to save Alis, his fairy friend, after she was captured by the evil sorcerer Amon. He later learns that the only way to defeat Amon is by collecting five legendary instruments which Amon has stolen.  The sorcerer placed a curse on these instruments so that their true powers cannot be used and then left them in the hands of his minions.  The only way to lift the curse is by collecting five stars.

Armed with only his bubble shooter, Milon must retrieve the legendary instruments, lift their curses and use their powers to defeat Amon and rescue Alis.

Traveling through many different worlds starting with the forest, Milon will be confronted by many enemies. Milon can either shoot bubbles to trap and send his enemies away, or he can jump and flatten his enemies temporarily turning them into a platform for him to walk across. 

Milon has three different "outfits": red, blue, and green. With the green outfit, Milon can withstand three hits. Each time he gets hit, he will be downgraded a color - green to blue, blue to red. If he gets hit with the red outfit, he will die and have to start the level over.

By collecting 100 music notes, Milon will get an extra life. There are also other useful items to get like bubble gum that will save Milon once if he were to fall, a special bubble shooter that let's him shoot multiple bubbles at once and a star that makes Milon temporarily invincible so that he can defeat enemies simply by running at them.</desc>

	<name>Dossun ! Ganseki Battle</name>
	<desc>A falling block puzzle game  in a pseudo-medieval fantasy setting that pits two characters against each other in an abstract form of combat that is quite similar to games like Columns. Combining at least three matching symbols in a vertical, horizontal or diagonal line does not only clear them off the screen, but also deals damage to an opponent. This means that players do not only have to keep their game area clear, but also pay attention to their characters health bar. Once a block touches the top of the screen or the health bar is diminished the game ends.

There are four different icons that have different effects when combined:
Books, swords and rocks deal damage to an opponent by attacking with fireballs, dragons or swords.
Bottles heal a certain amount of health.
Purple blocks have no effect, but clog up the screen nonetheless.

Chain reactions result in particularly powerful attacks or place one or more grey blocks inside the opponents area. They can be destroyed just like ordinary blocks, but they always stay in the same spot and do not fall down.

More complex chain reactions give access to special attacks, up to three of which can be held and activated with the shoulder buttons. Special attacks have different effects that include clearing all purple blocks, using all potions and clearing the bottom three lines.

As expected of a Nekketsu game you can play it rough by sneaking punches and kicks to "bend" the rules a bit, you can also use the "ki" or willpower of your players to trigger special moves and strategic management is limited to specifying different base strategies and behaviors for each player.</desc>

	<name>Dragon Ball Z Super Gokuden : Kakusei Hen</name>
	<desc>This is a direct sequel to the  first "interactive fighter" for SNES, based on the popular manga/animé series Dragon Ball. The game picks up the story where it ended in the previous game, and continues through Piccolo, Saiyajin, and Freezer sagas of the manga. After the battle with the Demon King (Daimaou) Piccolo, the twenty-third World Martial Arts Tournament is about to begin. But to the amazement of the hero Son Goku and his friends, their archrival Piccolo appears during the tournament, so that it quickly turns into a genuine battle.

You control Son Goku and his son Son Gohan, switching between them as the game progresses. The game is basically an interactive comic book in which you can influence the story by choosing to press a button when the game prompts you to make a choice. You'll also participate in battles. The battle system is similar to rock-paper-scissors game, where one kind of move always beats or always loses to another. You can dash into your enemies, attack physically, and perform special moves, pressing the buttons in real time (although the battles are divided into turns).

	<name>Dragon Ball Z : Legend of the Super Saiyan</name>
	<desc>Cho Saiya Densetsu is based on the popular manga/animé series Dragon Ball. It follows the events described in the beginning of Dragon Ball Z, the second story block, which tells about the connection of the hero Son Goku with a powerful alien race, and new mighty foes from far away planets. The game starts just where the tale of Dragon Ball begins. Son Goku goes to meet his friends, but is stopped by a mysterious stranger named Raditz who tells Son Goku they are relatives. Raditz demands from him to destroy humanity, and as Son Goku refuses, takes his son Son Gohan hostage. To rescue his son, Son Goku joins forces with his arch-rival, the Demon King Piccolo, who obviously has his own plans concerning Raditz. And thus begins the story during which Son Goku will learn of his true origin...

The game is a RPG similar to the card-based Dragon Ball Z RPGs for NES. During battles, you choose cards from your card inventory, which determine the nature and the strength of your characters' attacks. You can also train your characters in training houses and upgrade their special Ki power. Unlike early DBZ RPGs, you can move around freely in Cho Saiya Densetsu, and your movements are not determined by cards. You can also fly around the world and use your special Dragon Radar to discover location of magical Dragon Balls.

	<name>Dragon Quest I.II</name>
	<desc>This is a remake of two classic NES RPGs - an exclusively Japanese release of the two first Dragon Quest titles on one cartridge.

In Dragon Quest (known as Dragon Warrior in the US), you play as the descendant of the legendary warrior Erdrick, and your goal is to recover the magical Ball of Light from Erdrick's and the humanity's arch-enemy, the Dragon Lord. In Dragon Quest II, you assume the role of the descendant of the hero of the first game, and must join forces with two other characters in order to defeat a demon lord who destroyed a nearby city and killed its inhabitants. 

Both RPGs feature random battles and turn-based combat viewed from first-person perspective. In Dragon Quest you fight alone, while in the sequel two other characters can join your party, and you also fight against multiple enemies at once.

The remake includes updated graphics (although they still retain the original NES look), sound of SNES quality, and some changes in the gameplay and in the game world. Certain locations are larger, some menu commands (such as "Stairs") are omitted, and there is a larger variety of items.

	<name>Dragon Quest III</name>
	<desc>Dragon Warrior III is the concluding game of the first Dragon Quest/Dragon Warrior trilogy, and its story takes us back to the time period of the legendary Erdrick (also known as Loto), the ancestor of the first game's hero. You are the son of a powerful warrior Ortega, skillful in physical combat and spellcasting. Your father went out to fight the evil Baramos, who is responsible for the appearance of monsters in your region, and never returned. You are sent by the king on a quest to continue your father's brave deeds and to defeat Baramos.

Dragon Warrior III is a top-down role-playing game where you travel around the overworld, caves, castles, cities and other locations while battling random encounters, buying equipment, and talking to people. You and your party members receive experience when they beat up monsters and level up with enough experience, increasing their stats. The game features a day/night cycle - as you travel, day slowly changes to night and vice versa; shops are typically closed at night. 

You begin with control of just the main character but can quickly recruit three more members to your party. During the game you can choose to drop your current characters and recruit others at any time. The recruitable characters are divided into six classes: soldier, fighter, merchant, goof-off, pilgrim and wizard.

The game has a unique job system, giving you the ability to switch your hired characters' classes after they have achieved at least level 20 in their base class. Characters can switch to the other beginning classes, as well as the sage class, which is not available at the beginning. When a character switches classes, they lose all earned experience points, and half of their stats, but retain all of the abilities of the previous class. In this way, you can create powerful combination characters that are able to cast spells and fight effectively.

	<name>Dragon Quest V</name>
	<desc>You are the son of the brave warrior, Lord Papas. It appears that your mother died just after giving birth to you, and your father took you on a long journey when you were a little baby, and all you know is that he was searching for something. Now you are six years old, and Lord Papas brings you to your home village. After some time, you learn that His Highness Prince Henry was kidnapped by bandits. Your father attempts to rescue him, and during this action you discover that perhaps your mother is still alive... The game follows the story of Papas' son, and this story is stretched over years, as the hero grows and becomes a man of courage and virtue. During the game, the hero will discover the truth about his mother, and will have to make some crucial decisions, such as which girl to marry (the decisions affect the course of the game and its ending).

"Dragon Quest V" is a party RPG with turn-based combat, and battles viewed from 1st person perspective, just like all its predecessors. Your party roams about the world, fighting random enemies, performing quests, and defeating bosses. The novelty is in the game's unusual story, which spans almost a lifetime of the hero. 

"Dragon Quest V" was not available outside of Japan until 2009, when the DS version was released in the United States.

Was this just a dream? You have just fallen out of your bed dreaming! It's time to go to the village elder, to get a seemingly simple assignment - to sell some goods at a bazaar in the nearest town. But soon the hero will discover his dream was not so far away from reality...

"Dragon Quest VI" is the last SNES game of the Dragon Quest series (called "Dragon Warrior" in US). It is a party RPG with turn-based combat and battles viewed from 1st person perspective. Not much has changed since the NES days of Dragon Quest - gameplay style, setting, and even menu layout seem almost identical to those of the early classics. Like its immediate predecessor Dragon Quest V, this game was never released outside Japan.

	<desc>Long time ago, a flourishing civilization was destroyed by the rage of a mighty dragon. The Earth was set in flames, and no one escaped the destruction - no one except one man, who managed to launch himself forward, thousand years into the future. There, he was found by people of Kardosa Empire, who soon understood they have in their hands a human who possesses the secret of a superior ancient technology, that was unknown to the primitive civilization of the present...

You play the role of Aleth, the son of the High Priest in the small kingdom of Garade, whom leads a peaceful life with his friend Lagnus, Prince of Garade. One day Aleth accidentally gains possession of a precious artifact which is sought after by the Kardosa Empire. Aleth and Lagnus get involve in a conflict which will soon lead them to great discoveries of the secrets of the ancient civilization, of the great destruction that occurred thousand years ago, and of their own true identities...

The game is a console-style RPG: your party meets randomly encountered enemies and bosses, and fights them in turn-based combat viewed from isometric perspective. You upgrade armor by buying it, and also can buy weapons, but weapons can also be upgraded for money to different levels, to create powerful attacks called "techs".</desc>

	<desc>Dynamic Stadium is a baseball game from Eleca/Electronics Application released exclusively for the Super Famicom. While adopting the same behind-the-batter perspective as Namco's Famista series, Dynamic Stadium presents its athletes as comic book heroes rather than chibi figures, making them absurdly buff and frequently featuring action shots of them catching fly-balls and narrowly making it to base before being caught out. "Safe!" and "Out!" calls are presented as spiky word balloons.

Dynamic Stadium does not feature an official NPB license, so all the team names are fictitious. The game was published in Japan by Sammy Corporation and was never localized for overseas territories.</desc>

In Edo no Kiba you are always moving forward, either running or walking (or, in some levels, flying), although you can still move around the screen as in most belt-scrolling games. Your avatar attacks by slashing to the right with his energy sword, and he can also hold his sword defensively to deflect some bullets. By then holding forward and releasing attack he can throw the sword like a boomerang. He can also jump. A bomb follows the avatar around on any on-foot level that can be used to destroy all enemies onscreen at any time, and it will be replaced whenever a life is lost. Environments range from city streets to sewers and a flying battleship. Each level ends with a boss fight against an enemy that can withstand many attacks.</desc>

	<desc>In "Emerald Dragon", you play as Atrushan, a blue dragon who lives in the Dragon World. One day, he and his friends discover a ship wreck near a mountain. After examining the wreck, the dragons find a human child - a little girl. The wise White Dragon, the leader of the dragons, tells them that her name is Tamryn and that she will play an important role in their lives. The girl doesn't remember anything, and grows up together with the dragons. But when she turns fifteen, she decides to go back to her homeland - the Human World. Soon after Tamryn has left, Atrushan realizes he can't bear the separation, and asks the White Dragon to allow him to go and find Tamryn in the Human World. But a mysterious evil curse has been placed on the dragons - they can't appear among the humans in their true form. Atrushan agrees to become a human and goes to the Human World - to find Tamryn, and also a way to remove the curse...

The game features traditional Japanese-style RPG gameplay - Atrushan and his party travel over world map, visiting towns and descending into dungeons. The battle system is somewhat unusual - you can control only Atrushan, while other party members are controlled by the AI. You have a special bar for your actions in battle: once it is depleted, you can't perform any action and must wait for your next turn. You can move freely over the battle field, position yourself strategically near or far away from the enemy, attack from different sides, and assign general strategies to your non-controllable party members.</desc>

	<name>FEDA: The Emblem of Justice</name>
	<desc>In a fantasy world, a soldier from the imperial forces deserts after witnessing the massacre of innocent villagers by his unit. He is sent to jail to be executed, but manages to escape with the help of two former unit colleagues. The group flees through the country-side, while being pursued by imperial soldiers. On their way, they join forces with other rebels to fight against the enemy, while uncovering hidden secrets and evil plots by the Empire.

FEDA: Emblem of Justice is a strategy RPG similar to Shining Force and other titles with preset characters and linear gameplay. The player commands a party of varying size and characters with diverse skills.

In the main battle sections, the player and the CPU-controlled enemy take turns moving the troops and giving orders. A menu at the bottom of the screen shows all the possible actions, where soldiers can defend, move, attack, or use an inventory item on each turn. The range of their movements and weapons vary according to their nature. A crossbow character can shoot from the back, while most sword and knife users have to be adjacent to their targets. Magic offensive powers have different ranges as well, reaching enemies that are far away from the attacking character. Health points can be recovered by eating rations or by magic, where a healer can restore points to several characters at once.

Each party member has separate health and magic points, as well as other statistics like defense and attack power. They receive experience points after slaying an enemy or casting a spell, and extra points at the end of the battle. Their skills increase after surpassing 100 points.

The map screen shows the party and groups of enemies traveling through the landscape in turns. The menu has options for moving the group or camping. In the encampment, one of the characters around the fire pit saves the game, while another inside the tent provides system options to change the interface color, adjust sound volume and rename the party members.

In some locations like temples, villages and towns, the party has to explore the place and talk to the citizens to move on to the next section. In later battles, the player has to make a moral choice about attacking mutated humans. At the end of each battle, the party is assigned a dark or light emblem, and certain party members choose to leave or stay in the group based on its alignment.</desc>

	<name>Final Fantasy II</name>
	<desc>This is the fourth entry in the  Final Fantasy series. It was known as Final Fantasy II internationally, because the  second and third games were never released outside of Japan.

The military country of Baron is one of the strongest in the land, with a proud army and a majestic air force known as the Red Wings. But, while their armies are kind and loyal, the recent actions of the King are anything but. The young Captain of the Red Wings, Cecil, is ordered to steal a crystal from a village of innocent magicians, and when he questions the actions of his King, Cecil is immediately thrown out of the country and sent off to kill strange monsters. Little does he realize the price the King's actions will pay, and what the true secret of the crystals, and their powers, truly is...

This is the first Final Fantasy game that introduced the famous ATB (active-time battle) system: during the battles, you have a time indicator for each party member that tells you when this character is able to act. If it takes you too long to select a command for this character, the enemy will act without waiting for your turn. The game abandons the job system that was implemented in the first and the third game in favor of pre-set character classes (paladin, white mage, ninja, etc.) assigned to each party member.

The PlayStation version adds a new rendered intro and ending.</desc>

	<name>Final Fantasy V</name>
	<desc>The Elemental Crystals...the life source of the planet. With them, gentle winds blow, the seas are active, fire burns bright, and the earth is full of life. All seems well in the world, until the wind suddenly stops, the sea begin to grow stagnant, the heat of fire becomes scarce, and the earth begins to wither. King Tycoon, sensing a premonition of evil, hurries off to check on the Wind Crystal, only to witness it destroy itself.

Meanwhile, a young traveler named Butz is camping in a field when a giant meteor strikes the planet. When he heads out to examine the meteor, he is shocked to find a young girl named Lenna, who is the princess of Tycoon, and a old man named Galuf, who is on a critical mission. Later, joined by Faris, a pirate captain, the foursome must travel the land in search of the destructor of the Crystals, and save the planet at any cost!

Final Fantasy V featured many new gameplay options and tactics, including an improved Job/Ability system (like in Final Fantasy Tactics), the return of the ATB (Active Time Battle) turn system, and all of the classic FF gameplay you've come to know and love!

Final Fantasy V was released as a stand-alone game in Japan, and again in Final Fantasy Collection. Its U.S. debut was as part of Final Fantasy Anthology. It was also later ported to the Gameboy Advance, adding 4 new Jobs, a new 30-floor dungeon, a bestiary, a music player, the ability to quick save anywhere, a few extra pieces of equipment, and a newly update translation.</desc>

	<name>Final Fantasy III</name>
	<desc>This is the sixth entry in the  Final Fantasy series. It was called Final Fantasy III because three of the five previous installments of the series were never released outside of Japan.

1,000 years ago, the War of the Magi occurred. People remember it as one of the most horrible tragedies in history. Since the War of the Magi, magic has been all but forgotten, technology began to grow, and people returned to seemingly normal lives. The only true worry people had was the Empire, whose leaders were looking to revive the great force once known as "magic".

But then...something happened that would change the course of history forever...

The Empire had heard word of the remains of a mystical being, known as an "Esper", being found in the mining town of Narshe. Quickly, three soldiers were dispatched to find this Esper and bring it to the Emperor. One of the soldiers, a young girl, triggers a power in the Esper that will begin one of the most dangerous series of events ever. And the only ones who can help her are a rag-tag band of rebels and heroes, whose very hearts and souls are the only ones that can save the world from the mad plans of the Empire.

The game maintains the ATB (active time battle) system of the two previous Final Fantasy games, spicing classic turn-based combat engine with a real-time element. The customization system combines character-specific classes with free-flowing character development. By finding various Espers and equipping them on characters, you can improve their parameters in different ways and choose the magic spells you want to learn for each character.</desc>

	<desc>A remake and expansion of the first NES/Famicom Fire Emblem, Marth must face the betrayal if Hardin and an old enemy he thought long vanquished, the Dragon King Medeus.

Book 1 of the game is essentially a remake of the first NES game. Book 2 continues the story with the same characters.

This game expands the series, however it drops explorable towns and the navigation through a world map which was introduced in Fire Emblem: Gaiden. New features include the ability to dismount the horse and pegasus mounted units, to allow the riders to fight indoors if needed.

	<desc>Thracia 776 continues the Fire Emblem story with a midquel or a "meanwhile" setting. The events transpire during  Fire Emblem: Seisen no Keifu and the game contains many of the same characters from that game, while featuring cameos of many more. 

At its most simple the story is of Prince Leaf of Lenster's struggle to free his native land from two forces, the Grandbell Empire and the Loptus religion.

Features introduced into this part of the series include fog of war and night maps with limited vision, this requires characters to use torches and wands to light their way. Also the capture command which allowed enemies to be subdued and their weapons taken.

	<name>From TV animation - Slam Dunk SD Heat Up!!</name>
	<desc>Among the most famous Japanese comics of the 90s are definitely Slam Dunk. The manga tells of the running track that will make the young hoodlum Hanamichi Sakuragi who joined the basketball club in Shohoku high school just because initially interested in the sister of the captain Akagi but later this sport will conquer him so much that he becomes a real basketman.

The game is essentially an arcade sports title basketball basically. The main screen there will be little choice given the presence of only three modes: Story mode and classic friendly tournament. In the first we follow the events of the television series whose plot differs slightly from the original one: using Shohoku then we will qualify for the national championship. The second and third but I think there is a need for further explanation.

Executable field operations would also be different, you can also feint shots and blow up their opponents markers. Then successfully accumulating a sequence of 'affirmative action' row (steps succeeded, baskets made or avoided), will fill a horizontal bar at the top of the screen and, as he did a little 'in the playroom with the SNK Street Hoop, pressing simultaneously the three keys will not dorsal (except B), you can make a super nice shooting with supplemental animations depending on the player used.

	<path>./Front Mission (Japan) [T-En by FH v1.0b].zip</path>
	<name>Front Mission</name>
	<desc>In the future, many military forces are dependent on huge mech robots, called Wanzers (Walking Panzers) for combat. At Huffman Island, located in the the pacific ocean, wanzers are deployed by both the USN (United States of the New Continent) and the OCU (Oceana Community Union), who dispute ownership over the island.  One night, the OCU forces stage a covert recon mission on a facility located in Larcus, a USN-held territory and weapons facility. Lead by a soldier named Roid, this mission was entirely unofficial and violated the peace treaty. During the mission, USN forces lead by Commander Driscoll appeared and ambushed the OCU soldiers. During the combat, Roid's fiance, Karen is killed and the USN facility is blown up; placing the blame on the OCU. This became known as the &amp;quot;Larcus Incident&amp;quot; and the OCU denied all knowledge of it's soldiers actions. Ultimately it would be a leading cause to the second Huffman War. 

One year later, the war is underway and Huffman island is under provisional control of the OCU, but with a weakened military unable to defend against USN attacks. The soldiers involved involved in the Larcus Incident have all been discharged and disgraced. Roid spends his time fighting as a gladiator in the Wanzer fighting arena before being approached by a mysterious man. Colonel Olson has found out about Roid's history and wants him to command a mercenary unit he is assembling on behalf of the OCU, dubbed &amp;quot;Carrion Crow&amp;quot;. Convincing Roid that Driscoll is still out there on the island, Roid agrees.

Front Mission is a turn-based strategy RPG played from an isometric perspective. Players progress in the story through large strategic battles involving multiple units and cutscenes between them. At certain places, usually towns, the player can visit multiple locations including bars and shops, and talk to people. Shops are also found to purchase new weaponry, parts and make repairs. In combat, each Wanzer robot is a seperate unit and, has a large variety of weapons and attack styles depending on what's equipped. Units get experience for defeating enemies and also for using various techniques. The more an attack is used, the more powerful it becomes.</desc>

	<path>./Front Mission Series - Gun Hazard (Japan) [T-En by Aeon Genesis v1.01].zip</path>
	<name>Front Mission - Gun Hazard</name>
	<desc>The year is 2064, when the great solar power satellite, ATLAS is overshadowed by the invention of fusion power. The government alliance that had supported the building of ATLAS now find themselves facing economic crisis as the balance of power shifts. In this world of conflict and change, the Walking Panzer, or Wanzer, (a form of mecha) becomes the standard armored unit for wars and petty battles across the globe. For the small nation of Bergen, a coup d'etat is underway, staged by Colonel Ark. Seeking to establish complete control over the government and the NORAD units stationed there, Ark's first step involves the capture of President Orwen. Tipped off to the rebellion, Orwen seeks to flee from Bergen, looking for safe passage out of the seaport of Port Ertothal. A young Wanzer pilot, Albert Grabner, is assigned escort duty to the president by loyal elements of the army stationed there...

Gun Hazard is a side-scrolling version of the Front Mission series. Gameplay is more than a little similar to Cybernator or Metal Warriors. The player moves between different stages on an area map. Once inside a level, the player controls Albert and his wanzer as it moves left, right across the screen. The wanzer is able to jump, and attack with a primary and a special weapon. At any time during a level, Albert can eject from his heavily armed wanzer to explore. Although vulnerable when outside, Albert is able to reach areas the wanzer cannot, in addition to being a smaller target and being able to jetpack indefinitely.

Additionally, Albert can recruit other characters through the normal course of the story, some of whom can be designated to support roles. These support characters when set can provide a variety of different cover fire abilities for Albert during his missions. They too gain experience and levels. Different weapons and armor can be found or bought. Essential components include the Booster ability which allows the wanzer to hover and increase it's jumps, as well as the Dash ability which allows quick left-right movement by the wanzer. Money and experience are earned through the completion of level objectives as well as the kill count of enemy wanzers.</desc>

	<desc>The legend of the Golden Condor... from village to village and  from town to town, everybody speak of it - somewhere, beyond forests and mountains, there lies an idyllic Golden Land, the land of eternal happiness. Many adventurers have tried to find their way to the mysterious land of the Golden Condor, but how many of them have survived the impassable mountain paths, the dark forests and caves, and the vicious monsters? You are the wanderer Shiren, and the goal of your life is to find the Golden Land. Together with your best buddy Koppa, a talking weasel, you decide to venture deep into the dungeons that lead to the land, and to try your luck there.

Furai no Shiren (The Wanderer Shiren) is a roguelike, hack-and-slash game with randomly generated dungeon areas, items, and monsters. Despite being named Fushigi no Dungeon 2 it has no relation to the storyline or characters of the first game in the series, it does however share the same style of gameplay. The movement is turn-based. You visit towns and villages where you can buy and sell supplies. The dungeons are full of various traps and monsters, and sometimes non-playable characters you can talk to, some of which can join you on your quest.

	<name>Galaxy Wars</name>
	<desc>Home version of the 1979 arcade game of the same name. The aim is to launch missiles from the bottom of the screen at enemy spacecraft located at the top. To get there, the missile must pass through a asteroid belt flying across the screen and avoid the shots being fired down from the spacecraft. It is the players job to control the missile. Once launched it can be moved left and right and can be sped up by using the boost to speed it's way out of trouble. Points scored depend on the location of the hit on the enemy spacecraft. The speed at which enemy spacecraft move increases as the number of them decreases. Once all spacecraft have been destroyed, another wave starts, the speed decreases again and the process repeats. A life is lost when a missile is hit by a shot or collides with an asteroid.

Three game modes are available, B&amp;W and Color recreate the graphics and behaviour of the original arcade game in black &amp; white and color respectively whilst Neo mode updates the game with improved graphics and slightly different behaviour. There's also a turn-based two player mode. Other options include changing the number of lives available at the start of a game and the number of points needed for an extra ship.</desc>

	<name>Ganbare Goemon 2</name>
	<desc>As you may have guessed from the number 2 in the title, this is the second SNES game in the popular blend of the adventure and jump and run genres which is the Goemon series. Again, you (and your partner, in 2 player mode) control Goemon, his friend Ebisu-Maru and, new to the bunch, robot Sasuke, through loads of action stages and villages. Another new feature comes with 3D boss fights, featuring the giant mech type robot called "Goemon Impact".

	<path>./Ganbare Goemon 3 - Shishi Juurokubee no Karakuri Manjigatame (Japan).zip</path>
	<name>Ganbare Goemon 3</name>
	<desc>Third title in the Ganbare Goemon series of platform/adventure games which cast you as the heroic Goemon as he attempts to save feudal Japan from all sorts of wacky evildoers. This time around, a time-travelling machine threatens all of Japan and thus Goemon and co. must jump into the future to stop the machine.

The game alternates between a top-down world map view in which your characters explore the gameworld and side-scrolling stages in which the main action lies. As in most games of the series there are also loads of mini-games and unique gameplay sequences such as maneuvering Goemon's giant mecha.

The game continues the tradition of bizarre humor unique to the series, you can play as either Goemon or any of his 3 companions, Ebisumaru, Sasuke or Yae with each sporting unique weapons and abilities and also with their own dialogue options and cutscenes, which feature sitcom-like pre-recorded laughs for added wackiness.

	<name>Ganbare Goemon Kirakira Dch: Boku ga Dancer ni Nat</name>
	<desc>Fourth title in the Ganbare Goemon series of platform/adventure games which cast you as the heroic Goemon and his gang of wacky adventurers as he fights evil all over Japan. This sequel however, takes the action to outer space as the gang attempts to rescue Goemon Impact (Goemon's giant mecha) from a strange planet.

The game is based around a stage-select hub from which you select which character you want to play as and then attempt to clear the game's many side scrolling stages in standard action platformer fashion, navigating the obstacles and defeating all enemies you run into with your weapons. Since each one of Goemon's allies got stranded on a different planet, you must take control of each one of them in order to clear the stages and recover the special ability unique to each character that must be later put to use to release Goemon Impact. As in other games of the series there are also loads of mini-games and unique gameplay sequences triggered in boss fights, bonus stages and special situations. These involve shooter sequences, racing &amp; sport games and other assorted diversions.</desc>

In Ganbare Daiku no Gensan, you must go through five stages (with two areas each), destroying workers that get in your way using your mallet. You can use it to perform two special attacks. One that sends fireballs going in all directions, and a more powerful one that sends shockwaves, destroying everything on screen. At the end of each area, a boss needs to be defeated in order to proceed to the next one.</desc>

	<path>./Ganpuru - Gunman's Proof (Japan) (Translated En).zip</path>
	<name>Gunple: Gunman's Proof</name>
	<desc>The year is 1880. Two meteors fell on Earth on a small island near North American Pacific Coast. In the middle of the island there is a small town governed by a sheriff. At first, the town's inhabitants didn't pay attention to the meteors. But then, strange things started happening. Monsters attacked people, and left on the victims' bodies a mysterious crest with one word: demiseed. One day you, a young boy who lives in the town, are contacted by two aliens who came in a miniature space ship. One of the aliens introduces himself as Zero, the Space Sheriff, and explains that an intergalactic criminal named Demi has escaped from justice and is hiding somewhere on the island, being the cause of all the troubles lately. Zero then possesses your body, lends you his powers, and commands you on the quest to destroy Demi and to bring peace to your island and to the alien world alike!

The game is an action/adventure with slight RPG elements (buying and upgrading weapons, etc.) set in Wild West. While featuring traditional dungeon-crawling and many enemies to dispose of in real time combat, the game doesn't equip you with standard medieval swords, but with pistols, shotgun, machine gun, and even a flamethrower. Your weapons have infinite ammo. You can duck to avoid the alien monsters' fire, and perform special attacks with various types of weapons.</desc>

	<desc>One year ago they took from you your wife. Now it's time to pay them back, with interest.

Gekitotsu Dangan Jidousha Kessen: Battle Mobile plays similarly to Spyhunter in both perspective and objective, but your car in Battle Mobile isn't quite as high tech an instrument as that other game's vehicle. You can launch unlimited missiles, but they can only hit helicopters. For ground based targets you must dash into them to ram them off the road. Your car's health is constantly dwindling, even when you're not being attacked by enemies, so picking up the occasionally appearing energy refill items is essential. Shields can be picked up and stored that will make your car invulnerable to all damage for a short while.</desc>

	<name>Genocide 2</name>
	<desc>The world is still recovering from war. The mega-corporation CONEX has been spearheading the rebuilding process, but their true intentions are far from altruistic. By gobbling up their competition, and with the help of new weapons technology, CONEX is on the cusp of controlling the world. Only a hero from the last war can defy them and stop their plans of conquest.

Genocide 2 is a modified version of the PC release. The player takes control of a ten meter tall robotic ninja: the Tracer. Its only form of attack is a sword, but it can hold several extra weapons, and always has access to the Betty. The Betty can be fired in eight directions, returns to the Tracer after being fired, and can block enemy bullets. The objective of each stage is to reach the end, and some stages require you to destroy targets along the way. Any items picked up by the player, or damage done to the Tracer, carries over between stages, and each stage records your fastest time for beating them.

Aside from the visual downgrade, Genocide 2 also lost many minor enemy types and one mid-boss in the transition to the Super Famicom. The first stage was removed, and the first two levels of stage 2 were reversed. The Betty now can only be used for a limited time, and must recharge when its time has run out.</desc>

	<name>Ghost Chaser Densei</name>
	<desc>Ghost Chaser Densei doesn't take any dramatic departures from the standard scrolling-brawler plot-line. A city twenty minutes in the future must be saved from a terrorist organization, and between salvation and you is a long, straight line full of goons who must be punched. Aside from receiving orders from your boss before each level, and the quick conversation with a boss or rare NPC, the story won't attempt to get in the way of beat-downs.

There are three playable characters in Ghost Chaser Densei: the martial artist Makai, the mace wielding cat-girl Iyo, and the autonomous robot Belva. Each has unique moves as well as the basic abilities of attacking, jumping, blocking, throwing, and using a special if attack and jump are pressed together. Unlike most brawlers these special moves deplete a recharging special bar, not your health. Makai can throw fireballs and do a flying kick in midair, Iyo can triangle jump and preform a spinning piledriver, and Belva can double jump and preform a grapple special. Characters also have a team up special if playing in two player mode. Enemies range from armored soldiers to lizard men to robots, but most break down into the same hierarchy: weaker types will rush at you while stronger types will shoot projectiles then rush at you. Each level ends with a unique boss with multiple short and long range attacks.</desc>

	<name>Go Go Ackman</name>
	<desc>Ackman is not what one would call a good person. His job is to murder and steal souls for the Demon Lord. The angel Tenshi has taken it upon himself to put an end to Ackman's nefarious ways, and sends an army of angels and hired assassins to take out Ackman for good. It's just as well, because Ackman was getting bored without anyone to kill.

Go Go Ackman is a scrolling platformer starring the titular Ackman. Ackman can punch and charge up a ranged wave of energy, and he can also jump on some enemies to stun them before running into them and turning them into a sliding projectile. Ackman can hold up to three bombs that can clear the screen of enemies, and can also hold a weapon, either a sword, boomerang, or pistol, but it will be lost if Ackman is hit. Levels are linear, but do allow some exploration to find weapons and items hidden off the beaten road.</desc>

The angel Tenshi is still determined to end Ackman's nefarious ways, and this time he has enlisted the help of the angelic rock band Metal Angel. Ackman still murders at whim and has his companion Godon collect the souls of his slain, but this time Ackman can keep the weapons he finds, either sword, boomerang, or gun. Each weapon can be upgraded twice, but upgrades will be lost if Ackman is hit or finds a new weapon. Ackman can also now throw smaller enemies, although he can't move while holding them.

But, what's this, it seems there's been a shake up in the chain of command, and now Tenshi is wanted by the Angel Police! Will Tenshi be able to clear his good name? Who's really pulling the strings here? And, most importantly, does Ackman care about any of this at all?

The last of the Ackman games, Go Go Ackman 3 makes very few changes from Go Go Ackman 2, although Tenshi is now a playable character. Both Ackman and Tenshi can be switched between at special points in a level, but they share the same health meter and weapon. Unlike Ackman Tenshi can fly, but as he is an angel he can not collect the souls of enemies he kills. Souls have changed too, and are now used as currency in shops where Ackman can buy temporary powerups or healing. Finally Ackman has lost the ability to slide enemies along the ground, but he can now move while holding a stunned enemy.</desc>

	<path>./Gokujou Parodius (Japan).zip</path>
	<name>Gokujou Parodius</name>
	<desc>Konami's Gradius and space-shooter parody series continues with this second installment.  Gameplay is similar to the Gradius series in that you control a ship that can move anywhere on the screen while the screen itself scrolls from left to right. Enemies appear in waves and destroying all the fighters in a single wave releases power-ups which may be used to choose your ships upgrade. The Upgrade bar too is lifted from Gradius, however each character has different names and functions for their upgrades.

In Gokujyou Parodius, you are now able to now choose from 11 different characters... many of whom appear from other Konami games. They include:

1. Vic Viper: a ship from Gradius

2. Takosuke: the "octopus" of the previous Parodius game, and also seen in at least one Goemon

3. Twinbee: making his appearance from the Twinbee side scrolling games, Twinbee is a squat round robot with a jetpack and a disproportionately big punching glove

4. Pentaro: the original "joke character", Pentaro made an appearence in a previous Gradius title as a flying penguin. However he does star in his own games as well, Konami's Penguin Adventure

5. Hikaru: Hikaru is a girl in a tight fighting "bunny suit" who is riding on top of a missile

6. Mambo: Mambo is a strange looking fish with two horns on the top of his head and on his underside

7. Michael: some kind of fat angel pig. He has wings and a golden halo over his head

8. Koitsu: A blue stick man riding on a surfboard. He's probably one of the more 'normal' characters

9. Goemon: star of the Goemon series of games. Goemon is a ninja warrior equipped with wooden pipes. He flies around in a superman pose for his appearance in Parodius

10. Dracula: star of Konami's Kid Dracula, this white haired squat character retains his vampiric abilities including that of being able to change into a bat

11. Upa: a flying baby. Upa is actually from a Konami game by the name of Bokutte Upa but is probably just more recognizable as "the flying baby" of this crazy shooter

In addition to your player-character, the levels themselves will be full of a strange mix of Konami references, bright colors and the just plain zany. it's not uncommon to have to fly your ship underneath a woman's legs for example or chased by a giant walrus or having enemies shooting cute pink hearts at you.</desc>

The characters must get past several minor enemies on each level before fighting a stronger boss at the end. Each enemy will drop a cooking ingredient when defeated, and at the end of each level two ingredients can be combined to make a meal that will restore some health based on if the chosen character likes it or not. Environments range from slums and palaces to high speed trains and space ships, but in general there is not much continuity between different areas.</desc>

Reiko is armed with a magic baton that can be used to perform several types of melee attacks. The baton can be powered up to shoot various types of projectiles, though these powerups are lost if Reiko takes any damage. It can also be used as a type of grappling hook to access certain platforms. There are also limited uses of magic attacks that hit all enemies on the screen.</desc>

	<path>./GT Racing (Japan).zip</path>
	<name>GT Racing</name>
	<desc>GT Racing is a Super Famicom racing video game where the player gets to drive a Gran Turismo car in either championship or practice mode.  The game is based on the 1996 Super GT racing season using the horsepower standards and rules of the era.  

During championship mode, the player is asked enter a number, his or her driver's name, and the team name that he or she will use during the championship. The driver's name and team can be entered using either English or Japanese letters. When a player beats a record, he or she is asked to insert his or her number, name or initials (up to four characters and two digits for the number). Championship mode can last for multiple seasons. Playing ninety-nine seasons in a single racing career is theoretically possible due to the double-digit nature of the season information. There are eight different tracks, including the Suzuka Circuit that has been shown in video games since Pole Position II and Fuji Speedway (complete with a virtually photorealistic Mount Fuji in the background).

Versus mode is for two human players only and the record options allows the players to look at his or her previous records. In a race, there are up to fifteen opponents to race against. The player gets rewarded with an opportunity to upgrade his or her equipment after a top five finish on any race course. Bonus equipment includes a faster engine, better tires, and a special dose of nitrous oxide created specifically for Gran Turismo vehicles. All of the bonus automobile parts are automatically installed in the appropriate parts for supercharging the vehicle. Once all the special parts are earned, the automobile is considered to be fully upgraded. The ultimate goal is to win the Gran Turismo championship for his or her team in addition for him/herself.

The "free practice" is essentially a time trial mode where the player races by him/herself for up to ten laps. Acquiring damage is still possible either crashing into walls or through normal wear and tear. The fastest lap time gets captured for the record book just like in the other modes of the game. Before being able to practice freely, the player can also choose the weather condition and the setup of his vehicle</desc>

	<name>Hameln no Violin Hiki</name>
	<desc>In Violinist of Hameln you play the role of Hamel, a sort of wanderer / adventurer whose weapon is a violin. His music can cover enemies in fear, or even control their minds. Hamel and his mascot Oboe arrives at Staccato, a small town attacked by monsters, and drives them away with his power. Impressed, a cute little girl named Flute decides to go with Hamel in order to find and destroy the evil power behind the attacks.

The game is typical platform. You play as Hamel, and with your violin can shoot musical notes to beat your enemies. However, you count with Flutes aid. Flute follows you (although you can order her to stop and stay), but also can be grabbed and thrown at the enemies (yes, thrown at the enemies). Flute can also collect through all the stages some costumes that, when worn, give her special abilities, such as flying, leaping, breaking walls or even explode and kill all in screen. At the end of each stage, of course, youll find the typical boss, all named as musical instruments.

	<name>Hat Trick Hero 2</name>
	<desc>Hat Trick Hero 2 is the follow up to Hat Trick Hero, and it is loosely based on the arcade game Hat Trick Hero '93. One or two players can play in a exhibition game (one single match) or in a world league. The game scrolls horizontally uses mode 7 graphics to give the playing field some perspective.

There are 18 countries to select from, each with different running, kicking and technical abilities. You can use 5 different formations, which are 4-4-2, 4-3-3, 3-5-2, WM and libero. You also select a team captain from 8 different characters.

You can perform a foul tackle on the opponent, but when the referee is close enough to notice it you risk getting a yellow or red card. By holding down a direction after shooting the players can shoot the ball with curve effect. During the game a power-up bar is charged which can be used for special abilities. Holding down R allows you to run faster, but this slowly drains the power-up bar. With a fully charged power-up bar you can perform an unstoppable hyper shoot by pressing a special combination, and this drains the power-up bar entirely.</desc>

Cast into the role of a young boy from a remote village, you live a peaceful life until one day the pigs in your village go crazy, and as a result you are thrown underground, only to be saved by mysterious fairies. Something goes wrong, and the world as you knew it doesn't exist any more. You must establish contact to the great gods and other famous characters from the Greek mythology in order to restore the balance.

Like the previous games of the series, this is a standard console-style RPG with turn-based combat viewed from first-person perspective. There is a day/night cycle, which influences not only the appearance of the world map and the towns, but also the schedules of the world's inhabitants.</desc>

	<desc>The three RPGs (Hokuto no Ken 3-5) seemed to symbolize a genre change after the first two platformers, but the series changes the genre once again in the sixth installment, which is a fighting game similar to  Street Fighter II or  Mortal Kombat. The background story is based on the manga/animé of the same name. The years is 199X, and the world lies in ruins. Technology can no longer be used, and the land is controlled by fighters of rivaling styles. In this game, you can choose one of the fighter characters of the series: the main hero Kenshiro, his brother and rival Raou, Nanto Seiken fighters Rei and Souther, the assassin Heart, and others. You fight one-on-one, filling an energy bar and performing various attacks and techniques. There is a free fight mode where you choose your opponent yourself, and a two-player mode.

	<desc>Similar to the  sixth installment of the series, this is a fighting game along the lines of Street Fighter or Mortal Kombat. It is based on the main storyline of the manga/animé series Hokuto no Ken, also known as Fist of the North Star. 

After a terrible disaster mankind has stopped advancing the technology, and the world became a huge wasteland, controlled by fighter organizations. The main hero, Kenshirou of the Hokuto Shinken school, falls in love with a girl named Julia, who is abducted by one of the Nanto Seiken fighters, Shin.

	<name>Holy Umbrella: Dondera no Mubo</name>
	<desc>In "Holy Umbrella", you control a schoolboy who lives in modern-day Japan. One day, the sky suddenly turns dark blue, a heavy rain falls onto the city, and the boy finds, halfway between his house and the school, an umbrella which seems to have fallen from the sky. What he does not know is that the umbrella is magical! The moment he touches it, he is transfered to a parallel universe. Immediately, he is attacked by a huge tank, but a strange old man with a talking bird saves him. It seems that an evil creature named Dondera is threatening the country with the terrible monsters she created. But is it really so? You visit the capital town, talk to the emperor, and decide to investigate the matter...

"Holy Umbrella" is essentially a platform action game, but unlike most other games of this genre, it allows you to visit towns, where you control your hero in a standard RPG-like top-down fashion. You can enter houses, talk to townspeople, etc. On platform levels, which are the main part of the game, you have to switch between the hero, the talking bird Bonto who accompanies you on your quest, and the girl Saki, whom you meet later in the game. Every character has his/her own special abilities and own ways of fighting: the hero can slide through air by using the umbrella, Bonto can double-jump on high ledges, Saki can jump on walls, etc. You use your umbrella as a weapon, as well as elemental stones you can collect on your way and throw at enemies. You also find various power-ups and items you can equip on the hero.</desc>

	<name>The Iron Commando</name>
	<desc>Iron commando is a brawler beat-em-up like Final Fight or Streets of Rage with lots of weapons and big end bosses.

The B-movie story is cheesy and does nothing more than accommodate for the action. From the introduction sequence: "The peril came from outer space. A meteorite entered the earth's atmosphere bringing chaos. After observation, the scientists found that the meteorite was radioactive and had to be destroyed. Unfortunately, terrorists from g.h.o.s.t. want the meteorite too. The Iron Commando's mission is to retrieve the deadly body and avoid genetic mutation."

The player or players walk along the levels beating up enemies. On some levels you ride a motorcycle or jeep, even a mine kart, and shoot your way through hordes of enemies. There are several end bosses, some are screen filling like a helicopter and a giant robot.

Some enemies will drop food, grenades or weapons as you beat them into a bloody pulp. There are lots of different Weapons: 9mm guns, shotguns, machine guns, knives, baseball bats. The weird thing is, enemies that use a sword and even dogs will occasionally drop a machine gun or baseball bat.

	<desc>Jaleco Rally: Big Run: The Supreme 4WD Challenge is a rally racing game and sim in which the player takes part in the Paris-Dakar rally. The game actually begins in Tripoli, Libya and passes through around 2,500 miles of African desert, swamp and jungle on the way to Dakar.Jaleco originally developed the game for the Arcades before porting it to the Super Famicom. This home version was never released outside of Japan. The game was also ported to the Amiga and Atari ST, where it is known simply as Big Run.GameplayIn addition to passing each checkpoint under the required time - the checkpoint system ubiquitous in solo racing games of the era - the player must also be aware of environmental dangers along the course and needs to select a sponsor, navigator and engineer team before starting. They must also balance the weight of their car, as too few replacement parts might cause a problem further into the race yet having too many will greatly reduce the car's top speed.</desc>

	<name>Smart Ball</name>
	<desc>The game involves going through 8 stages (broken up into two parts each) of side-scrolling action. At the end of each stage is a boss monster that must be disposed of.

Jerry moves by sliding across the ground and can latch on to walls and climb them. Jerry can also jump, stretch out to cling to ceilings, and also move at a faster pace. Jerry can consume balls that he finds during a stage and can then fire them out of his body at enemies blocking his path. Enemies can also be defeated by jumping on them and then flattening Jerry's body on them. Also, there are flowers that contain items for Jerry to collect. Items include life, which refills health, a 1-up that adds an extra life, and a seed, which will grow a climbable beanstalk when planted. If the player collects the scattered letters that appear in every stage that spell out the name Jerry, the player will earn two extra lives.</desc>

	<path>./Jikkyou Oshaberi Parodius (Japan).zip</path>
	<name>Jikkyou Oshaberi Parodius</name>
	<desc>The third in the Paroidus series, it's the same gameplay and zaniness that substantiated the first two games. Gameplay itself is a copy (a parody rather) of Konami's famous Gradius series in that the screen scrolls from left to right (most times) and you maneuver around the screen destroying waves of enemies and avoiding obstacles. Unlike previous Parodius titles, this game contains a difficulty adjustment option, allowing the player to make things easier... or harder. Also unique to this parodius title is a bit of japanese digital voice that shouts out various things at you while you play. Survival throughout the level earns you a boss fight, which frequently includes some of the strangest characters in the game. Make no mistake, this *is* Gradius,  but with all sorts of strange graphics, music and references to other Konami games... So in other words, it's Parodius!

There are now more power-ups than ever including the standard power-up (red, used to upgrade weapons), the shield power-up (blue) and a variety of different coloured bells. Green Bells will make you huge on the screen, Yellow Bells are worth points (points in turn are worth extra lives), Blue Bells are "big bombs" that clear the screen of enemies/shots and can be saved until you need them, White Bells will give your character a megaphone that will shout out japanese phrases, the characters of the phrases themselves can be used to damage enemies (the power of words!), The Red Bell stockpiles you with three point-defense lasers... only one of which can be activated at a time and disappear after a short while. Finally the purple bell will clear the screen of all but the strongest enemies... and will turn them into power-ups.

This time around there are 16 different characters to chose from and the power-ups and weapons that they use are more unique than ever. Several familiar "faces" return and they've brought along friends to share in the party:
Vic Viper: The "gradius ship" appears once again in this gradius parody, equipped with it's traditional gradius weapons
2. Lord British: The "other" Gradius ship and arguably the more famous of the two. Lord British has weapons similar to Vic but quite different also.Missiles and shields work differently for instance. And Lord British uses a Ripple gun instead of a double shot.
3. Pentaro: It just wouldn't be a Parodius game if Pentaro wasn't involved. Originally from Konami's Penguin Adventure, Pentaro retains the same abilities from previous Parodius games... however his Potion weapon may now hit multiple enemies and his normal weapon shots explode against obstacles
4. Hanako: Also from Penguin Adventure, Hanako the penguin is Pentaro's girlfriend. While Pentaro is blue, she is the red penguin. She plays nearly identical to Pentaro with the exception of her S. Bomb weapon
5. Twinbee: Twinbee, from the Twinbee games is another returning Parodius star. Unfortunately he hasn't been upgraded since previous games, so his weapons are nearly identical; Punching Glove Rocket and all...
6. Winbee: Winbee, also from Twinbee is red and has moves identical to Twinbee, except for one difference... when she has 3 Options available, she can power them up to harm enemies that touch them.
7. Tako: Again, it just wouldn't be a parodius game without a flying octopus. And here he is, still wearing a baseball cap, but otherwise unchanged from previous Parodius games.
8. Belial: A yellow female octopus with a bow in her hair, she is identical to Tako with the exception of her Missile and Double weapons... which are instead identical to the Vic Viper.
9. Soitsu: A stickman (now green) surfing aboard a paper airplane, Soitsu plays similar to Koitsu from the previous game, aside from his colour. His laser weapon is able to charge up to deliver more power and he drops little stickmen onto the ground which occasionally dance around rather than attacking. Additionally he has an "upgrade power" (S. Power) that make all his other abilities stronger
10. Doitsu: Similar to Soitsu but with a Double Laser ability. He is an orange stickman riding on a paper airplane and no "upgrade" power, using normal options instead
11. Upa: Upa aka The Flying Baby is back from the previous Parodius game (as well as his original game, Bokutte Upa) and plays nearly the same. Instead of a shield, he has a Mega Crush power that damages all on-screen enemies... and also has an "Upgrade Power" in the form of Grade Up that makes his other abilities stronger.
12. Rupa: Another flying baby (presumably also from Bokutte Upa), Rupa plays similar tot Upa but with a Multi Spread gun which fires missiles in multiple directions (with each upgrade) and a S.Vulcan gun which automatically aims towards enemies.
13. Mike: A cute little kitten who happens to to have a very powerful wave weapon which can travel through obstacles and enemies. Additionally he has a multiple bomb ability which requires his "upgrade ability" (Grade Up) to get really powerful
14. Rani: Another cute kitten (this one rolled onto his bottom facing forward) with very power weaponry. Some of the highlights include a Reflect weapon wherein the shots bounce off of obstacles. Another is the S laser which travels forward but then homes in Up or Down to hit the enemy. And finally, Rani's missile weapon is two homing bells. Rani also has an "upgrade ability" in the form of Grade Up, however it only upgrades the Reflect Shot.
15. Memim: One of the fairy characters, Memim is a female flying girl with standard female bikini clothing. She carries some unique missile weapons however, whose direction is determined by Memim's current location on the screen when fired.
16. Sue: The other fairy with tight clothing, Sue is unique in that her weapons are upgraded/displayed in a different order from everybody else's in the game. For instance her Option is the 4th weapon on the list rather than the 6th... requiring less power-ups to activate it. However aside from that... all of her weapons are the exact same as the Vic Viper's.</desc>

The game uses pre-rendered 2D sprites and features Vs, Tournament, and League play for up to four players. Also included is a career mode where you create a wrestler and control each aspect of his career up to his final victory in the inter-league tournament. And you can also configure matches to be standard, tag (with 4 or 6 wrestlers), submission or death-matches which adds such features as live wires and explosives to the ring.</desc>

	<name>Jojo no Kimy na Bken</name>
	<desc>One of the earliest titles based on the animé series Jojo's Bizarre Adventures, this game is not a pure fighter, like Capcom's more known title, but an adventure/RPG hybrid with turn-based fights.

In a futuristic world, there lives a young man named Jojo who holds a terrible power within: the power to drain life from enemies. This power is somehow connected to the evil vampire Dio who is terrorizing the world. Jojo must find faithful companions on his quest to restore peace and to master the power within himself.

In this game, you navigate Jojo in an adventure-like fashion, viewing the hero from third-person perspective. You can call up a menu at any time to choose a command such as "Look", "Talk", etc. Being a Japanese adventure, the game doesn't contain puzzles. from time to time, you'll be attacked by enemies and will fight them in turn-based combat viewed from first-person perspective. Jojo and his party members possess the so-called "stands", super-powerful creatures you summon during fights. before each fight, you'll have to choose one of fice available tarot cards to determine the amount of luck and compatibility of the stands you'll have in the game.</desc>

	<name>Jutei Senki</name>
	<desc>Jutei Senki is a turn-based strategy game, never released outside of Japan. The game takes place in an alternate universe where centuries ago humanity and their tree soldiers called Junei fight against Letum, a race of robots powered by magic.

The player commands the human army. The mission in each battle is to defeat the enemy army or take their headquarters in a limited amount of turns. In the human army's main building, the player can recruit new soldiers, but their number is limited. Each unit has its own statistics, including range, speed and attack power. Battles are carried out automatically, with animations on a separate screen.

There are three mission modes which include Campaign, Tutorial, and Expert modes and there is also a two-player versus mode.</desc>

Each Episode starts with an introduction by "Oyassan" Tachibana, and stars a different Rider with his own unique special move. Episodes are broken up into six levels of combat against several Shockers riding their own motorcycles or cars or other vehicles, followed by a boss battle in the seventh level. After levels 2 and 5 the Kamen Rider will repair any damage and be able to choose from one of 4 limited powerups, such as invincibility, super speed, or a machine gun. Most of the time Kamen Rider will defeat enemies by riding alongside them and punching them, and enemies will try to do the same to ram or shoot him.</desc>

In the late game (as the game follows the MS: Gundam film story) the player controls the Gundam and two Guncannons.

	<desc>Kikou Keisatsu Metal Jack is a scrolling brawler based on the anime of the same name. At the start of the game the player can choose from Red Jack, Silver Jack, or Blue Jack. Red and Silver both have weapons they can find ammo for in levels (a gun and baton, respectively), and all three can do a multiple hit combo or a jumping attack. At the end of a level the Jack will be met by his vehicle which will then merge with his armor. In this form the Jack's attacks are strengthened and he can charge up an attack that hits every enemy onscreen.

There is no story told at any point in the game, so if you want to know what's going on you'll have to track down the anime.</desc>

	<name>Kishin Douji ZENKI: Battle Raiden</name>
	<desc>Once already Chiaki and her reluctant demon servant Zenki have saved the world from the forces of darkness, but apparently once is never enough. Chiaki has a vision of five cloaked figures and knows that only she and Zenki can stop them. At once they set off to track down the demon leaders.

In Kishin Douji ZENKI: Battle Raiden the player takes the role of Zenki. At first, and occasionally through the game, Zenki will be in his powered down form where he can only punch, jump, and dash. After Chiaki recovers her bracelet, or regains her concentration, or whatever she needs to do at the time, she can transform Zenki into his powered up form. In this form Zenki deals more damage and has a much longer list of attacks that get added to as the game progresses, such as a pillar of energy, an electrified punch, and a dashing attack. By picking up scrolls Zenki can do a powerful Rudora attack to all enemies on screen, but this attack damages Zenki as well.

To complete platforming levels Zenki will have to make it to the end of the level while occasionally finding hidden stone monuments that, when destroyed, will drop items as well as alter the level or remove obstacles, allowing Zenki to pass. After a stage's first platforming level is a midboss fight, and after the second platforming level is the boss fight proper.</desc>

	<name>Kouryuu Densetsu Villgust - Kieta Shoujo</name>
	<desc>This game is based on the animé series Villgust. The main hero of the game is Shun, a teenager who lives in modern-day Japan. One day, when he was going back from school with his girlfriend Michiko, Shun noticed a strange red-eyed rabbit. When he tried to follow him, Shun suddenly found himself all alone in a forest clearing. He was immediately approached by a group of four adventurers who said they were members of a group called R.A.G.E. (Resistance Against God of Evil). Apparently, Shun was transported into a parallel medieval world, and an evil organization known as Vile was the one behind Michiko's kidnapping. Shun and his friends will now do anything to help Michiko and to destroy Vile!

This is a traditional console-style RPG. You travel on the world map, visit towns, buy equipment and items, descend into dungeons, and fight random enemies in turn-based combat viewed from a third-person "over-the-shoulder" perspective. The party can hold up to five characters. The characters level up in a standard way, and also get experience and new levels for their magical spells.

You must line-up blocks of the same type as they fall in the classic rectangular play area, clearing them before time runs up or they fill the entire screen. Features a 1P tournament mode, and a 2P competitive Vs mode in which you can chain blocks and send them to your opponent as "attacks" in hopes of causing him/her to lose.</desc>

The game continues the "Worldwide Dodge Ball tournament" motif of the original in which several teams from around the world compete in side scrolling dodge ball matches to see which one is the best. Gameplay is similar to other sport games in which you control the character that has the ball at the time (although a lead character always marks the formations and generally controls the team), and special moves can be executed to try and eliminate your opponents (such as homing throws and other esoteric moves). 

This sequel also adds more comprehensive tournament mechanics, for instance your performance in each match allows you to buy power-ups and special moves to enhance your players, you can also create a custom team and manage them throughout the tournament by adding or removing members as you see fit (you can even try to lure players from opposing teams). You can also choose among a series of formations and AI profiles in case you play alone, although you can use a multi-tap to play with up to 4 players.

Available game modes include Tournament, Vs and Mechabutsuke mode which is a variation on Vs that involves a free-roaming court and no outfielders.</desc>

	<name>Kuusou Kagaku Sekai Gulliver Boy</name>
	<desc>You are a boy named Gulliver, who lives together with his two best friends - the girl Misty and the young inventor Edison - in Venice, Italy. The evil Prince of Spain, Judou, is after the mysterious Blue Crystals who grant immense power to those who possess them.

	<name>Laplace no Ma</name>
	<desc>1924, the town Newcam, Massachusetts. On the outskirts of the town stands the Weathertop mansion. It was just an ordinary place until the last owner, Benedict Weathertop, started practicing black magic. He killed his parents and populated the mansion with all kinds of undead. Since then, nobody dared to approach the mansion. But a short while ago, two boys were found dead near this horrible place. Apparently, the boys had tried to enter the mansion. Another evidence pointed out that a girl followed them - but her body hasn't been found yet, and there is a slight hope she might be alive. 
This is where you, the hero of the game, decide to investigate the mystery, and to venture into the mansion...

"Devil of Laplace" is a hybrid between survival horror and traditional Japanese RPG, similar to the pioneer of this genre, Sweet Home for NES. Unlike "Sweet Home", this game has less puzzles and is more oriented towards RPG elements. You are not stuck in the mansion, but can leave it, visit the town, and buy supplies. Later you also visit other locations such as a castle, etc. The battles are random, turn-based, and are viewed from first-person perspective. The hero of the game can recruit three other characters to the party of five available. Each character (including the hero, to whom you assign gender and class) belongs to one of the five character classes: Dilettante, Medium, Detective, Scientist, or Journalist. Dilettante is an all-around character with defensive magic, Medium is a kind of a black mage, Detective is a melee fighter, Scientist can construct powerful machines to perform various techniques, and the Journalist can take pictures of the monsters, which is the only way to gain money in the game.</desc>

	<name>Lennus II: Fin no Shito</name>
	<desc>This is a follow-up to the game "Lennus", which is know outside of Japan as  Paladin's Quest. The game is set in a world of Andell - a floating continent where ancient prophecies and highly advanced technology co-exist. A curse has fallen onto Andell - its four island, once united, are now separated, and are floating away from the heart of the continent, the temple of Andell. The sages of the temple summon a great hero named Farse, who must find a special magic orb for each one of the islands, which is the only way to re-unite them. Farse embarks on his journey, aided by three Terranos, the big-eared inhabitants of Andell.

This is a console-style RPG where you control a party containing the main hero Farse and three Terranos you select out of the available five. You encounter random enemies and bosses and fight them in turn-based combat viewed from first-person perspective. You can use special attacks and magical spells, which don't consume magic points, but take away a certain amount of your hit points. Instead of healing items, you have mini-bottles you can refill with potions in special places in towns. You can equip various magical artifacts which will allow you to use magic spells belonging to eight different elements.</desc>

	<name>Little Magic</name>
	<desc>May is an apprentice mage at Magic School and must pass the final exam.

A puzzle game seen from a top-down perspective. The goal of each level is to open the exit by pushing a magic stone on a designated spot. May can also push objects one tile ahead without moving herself. This is often used to get the stone over water that she can't cross herself. May's other ability is to create magic bubbles. She can create bubbles in three different sizes. Bubbles will pop after a certain amount of time, depending on their size. If they pop while next to the stone or another bubble, the stone or bubble will be moved one space. Since May can create several bubbles simultaneously, it is possible, and often necessary, to create chain reactions to maneuver the stone into the desired position.

As the game progresses, levels become increasingly difficult and new hazards and enemies are introduced. Enemies follow a set movement pattern and can sometimes be stopped, but not destroyed by magic bubbles. Later levels are made more complicated by different types of tiles including: grass that slows down May, ice that May and the magic stone will slip over, spikes that destroy the stone if it is pushed into them, collapsing tiles that can only be walked over once, rune tiles on which May cannot create magic bubbles, teleporters and others.</desc>

	<desc>In "Live a Live", you control seven main characters and play through seven different stories set in seven different time periods: prehistoric age, medieval Europe, feudal Japan, a futuristic world with robots and weird machines, etc. Those stories appear to have no common points, yet after completing all of them, you'll see they are in fact connected - the worlds of all those characters are threatened by the same ultimate evil force.

The combat features many innovations compared to traditional console RPGs: your position on the battle field is important, and certain techniques can be used only from certain positions, and enemy attacks also affect only specific parts of the field. Out of the seven chapters, some have more battle-oriented gameplay, while others are more devoted to puzzle-solving and information-gathering.

The game is one of the least known Squaresoft products, and was never released outside of Japan.</desc>

	<desc>All the king's candy has been stolen by invaders who live down in the dungeon. The king summons twin heroes: Justy and Liberty to try to get it back.

Lode Runner Twin: Justy to Liberty no Daibouken is a side-scrolling platform game, adapted for the SNES from the original Lode Runner. However the atmosphere has changed to a lot more cartoonish and happy. Controlling either Justy or Liberty, the player is able to move back and forth, climb ladders, cross ropes and dig holes in some types of surface. The enemies then fall into these holes and the player can walk over them. The goal in each level is to get all the candy.

There is also a battle mode that puts Justy versus Liberty to see who can fetch the most candy.

	<desc>The game is set in the same universe and shares characters and storyline with  Puyo Puyo puzzle games. Unlike Puyo Puyo, Mado Monogatari is a Japanese-style RPG. You play Arle, a five-year old apprentice magician. She is attending a special kindergarten, and it is time for the Final Exam. At the same time, Arle receives a mysterious letter that tells her that if she finds eight magical gems and takes them to the Wizard Mountain, she'll be granted one wish. Arle decides to search for the gems which are scattered all over the world, and to overcome all the obstacles with her great magic power!

The game features random enemy encounters and turn-based combat, which takes place on a platform (Arle to the left, the enemies to the right). You can't perform physical attacks at all, and your only way of harming enemies is through magic. During the game, you learn a variety of magic spells, which can be upgraded later. In battles you can't see your own and the enemies' hit points, and have to act according to your intuition.

	<desc>This game is based on the anime and manga by manga artist CLAMP.

In the land of Cephiro, the world was kept in peace and harmony by the wishes of Princess Emauraude, the Pillar of Balance. But the evil priest, Lord Zagato, has kidnapped Emauraude, and Cephiro is being invaded by deadly beasts. If this continues, Zagato will gain complete control of Cephiro! The only ones who can stop him are the legendary Magic Knights...

And those Magic Knights are three young girls from Earth. Hikaru Shidou, Umi Ryuuzaki, and Fuu Hououjii have been plucked from modern-day Tokyo and brought to Cephiro by Emauraude, and they're the only ones who can defeat Zagato...as the Magic Knights!

This interpretation of the manga story is a traditional Japanese-style RPG. The player controls the three main heroines as a party; each one uses different weapons and learns various skills. Typically for the genre, the party roams the top-down world, visits towns, descends into dungeons, chats with non-playable characters, and fights randomly appearing enemies in turn-based style.</desc>

	<name>Makeruna! Makend 2</name>
	<desc>The Ghost Prime Minister is holding a fighting tournament, and 14-year-old Hikari Tsurugino, the second Mighty Makendo, must face off against all sort of strange apparitions. Characters from the first game make appearances, including Mai Tsurugino, Hikari's sister and the first Mighty Makendo.

Makeruna! Makendo 2 is a comical VS fighting game with an eclectic cast of characters including a soccer player, a zombie, a musclebound mer-man, and a giant robot. Bouts are best two-out-of-three, and each character has both a life bar and a "Makendo" meter, which lets each character perform a variety of special attacks. The game includes a story mode and a 2-player versus mode.</desc>

	<name>Mario and Wario</name>
	<desc>This is the Spirit Forest. Within these woods lives a sprite, and those who meet it find happiness, or so the tale goes. One day, Mario came to the woods to confirm the legend. Peach and Yoshi should have been together with Luigi......but alas, the visage of Luigi was missing. Mario's group of three have separated to find lost little Luigi.

At once, the suspicious sound of an engine was in the air. I wonder what it could be? It was Wario riding his personal plane, the Bulldog, and it dropped a bucket from the sky.

"Whew, woosh!"

And suddenly, the bucket was a snug fit on Mario's head.

"Uwagh, I can't see in this thing!"

The sprite of the woods, Wanda, witnessed it. The petite pixie did not have the strength to remove the bucket on her own, but she desired to help somehow. Thus, Wanda sends Mario a signal with her magic wand, determined to reunite him with Luigi......</desc>

	<name>Mazinger Z</name>
	<desc>Dr. Hell's robot army has destroyed Tokyo, and now only Kouji Kabuto, and the giant robot Mazinger Z, can stop them from taking over the entire world. Animated cutscenes between levels tell the story of the game.

The Mazinger Z comes with a full armory of anti-robot weaponry, from super-powered karate moves to missiles, Breast Fire, and its signature Rocket Punch. Special moves deplete a regenerating energy meter, while Rocket Punches can be preformed at any time, although Mazinger will be unable to punch until its arms return. Each level contains several varieties of enemies, all of them from the show and unique to each level, that must be defeated to progress. Some enemy robots will fire projectiles from a distance while others will rush in attempt to grapple the Mazinger, and sometimes more than one enemy must be fought at once. Enemies will drop healing items and occasionally an item that upgrades Mazinger's Rocket Punch to the Iron Cutter for a limited time. At the end of each level is a fight with a stronger boss robot with more dangerous attacks.</desc>

	<name>Metal Max Returns</name>
	<desc>This is a remake of the game Metal Max, originally for NES. You are a little boy who lives with his father in a town in a futuristic world dominated by machines. Your wish is to become a "hunter" - to kill monsters that roam the world and to receive rewards for that. The storyline and the gameplay basics remained unchanged in this remake. You fight enemies in turn-based combat, and use vehicles, such as your own personal tank Mosquito, to transport yourself through different areas, and to participate in battles. You can also buy equipment and upgrade your vehicles.

The remake features enhanced graphics and sound, background pictures for battles (they were black in the original), slightly different locations (more houses in towns, sometimes different layout of the towns and of the world map), and reduced difficulty level.</desc>

Miracle Girls is based on the characters of the manga and anime of the same name. The player starts the game by picking either Tomomi or Mikage, although they both have the same abilities. Either can jump or toss candy, which will render enemies harmless for a few seconds as they eat it. Enemies incapacitated in this way can be used as platforms. Hidden in levels are bombs that fill the screen with candy, turning any onscreen enemies into heart rings, fruit that increase health, and doors that lead to a celestial slot machine that can reward additional lives. At the end of each level is a different challenge with a boss, such as a top-down squirt-gun fight or a game of matching cards.</desc>

	<path>./Monstania (Japan) (Translated En).zip</path>
	<name>Monstania</name>
	<desc>The hero of the game is Fron, a sixteen-year old boy who lives on the island of Monstania. One day, strolling in the forest, he notices a strange light. The light lead him to a clearing, and then suddenly disappeared. But Fron realized what was the meaning of that light - it was a fairy! Of course, everybody knew that fairies had been long extinct, but Fron never believed in that. All his life he wanted to meet a real fairy, and now, when the opportunity has come, he firmly decides to find her. His girlfriend Tia helps him on the dangerous journey, during which they meet a mysterious little girl named Chitta, and get involved in a grand adventure, that will ultimately lead them to the battle against the dark force that threatens the whole Monstania!

"Monstania" has a somewhat unusual gameplay within the frames of console RPGs. You don't explore the world in the game: it is entirely linear and takes you to the next destination by itself (only at a few points you can choose where to go next by selecting an appropriate answer). Once within the location, you cannot leave it until you complete all your objectives there, which then take you to the next location. The objective is usually a large strategic battle. You navigate your party members on the battle field, attack with melee and long-ranged weapons, and use special technique which require action points. Unlike most other turn-based strategy games, an enemy makes a move immediately after you did the same with one of your characters, without waiting for the "enemy turn". The RPG element is not very significant: your characters level up automatically after each battle. There are also some puzzles to solve in certain locations.</desc>

	<path>./Mystic Ark (Japan) (Translated En).zip</path>
	<name>Mystic Ark</name>
	<desc>Seven heroes from seven different Worlds. Seven heroes who were brought to a mysterious temple on a remote island and transformed into statues. Seven heroes who are chosen to bring harmony back to the universe: Miriene the witch (wizard), Lux the tetsujin (a race of iron people), Reeshina the grappler (monk), Tokio the ninja, Kamio the ogre, and Mesia the priestess. The seventh hero is you, the protagonist of the game - the knight Remeer or the female warrior Ferris. Your first task will be to release your companions from the statues they are locked in. You must travel to the Cat World and to retrieve an important artifact. But your main objective is to visit all the seven Worlds and to find seven mystic arks - the items that will re-unite those Worlds and bring peace to them.

"Mystic Ark" is a RPG closely connected to 7th Saga. You travel on overworld map, visit towns, buy equipment, and descend into dungeons. The combat is turn-based and viewed from a third-person "over-the-shoulder" perspective. The battles are not random: the enemies can be seen as white dots on your radar, and if you don't want to fight, you can sometimes outrun or avoid them. The game also contains elements of pure adventure: often you must investigate objects closely and use items from your inventory on them.</desc>

	<name>Nekketsu Tairiku: Burning Heroes</name>
	<desc>The young fighter Ryu was thrown out of his father's home, and this childhood trauma has been dominating his life ever since. His only wish is to surpass his father and to show him he has become a better fighter than him. Laila is a cheerful treasure hunter. She dreams only of valuable things, adventure, travels, and life in the capital city.  Gaou is experiencing a personal tragedy: he wants to discover the mystery of the disappearance of a woman he loved, Asuka, aided by his best friend Froz. Naaga is a girl who wears a heavy armor, which - as she thinks - will prevent her from losing any battle. At present, she has problems since she owes a million gold pieces to her guild. What do those heroes have in common? As their ways cross, they will find out they are in fact pursuing one and the same goal...

"Burning Heroes" lets you start as either one of the four characters. Each one starts in a different place and is seemingly absorbed in his/her personal quest, but as the game progresses, the four heroes meet each other. You should also find and "unlock" four other playable characters as you advance in the game. The gameplay system of "Burning Heroes" is similar to other console-style RPGs: you fight random enemies and bosses in turn-based combat, viewed from third-person perspective, like in Final Fantasy games. As you get hit in a battle, your "passion" (literally "hot blood", nekketsu in Japanese) level rises, and the more damage you take, the quicker you reach 100%. Once the passion bar is full, you can summon a powerful monster and to unleash a devastating attack on the entire enemy party.</desc>

Traveling in faraway lands, Duke heard that his homeland was under attack. He decided to return to Neugier. On the way his ship was attacked by pirates, lead by a mysterious demon named Ord. After he barely escaped the ship, Duke found his way into his father's castle. He realized now that the pirates' attack and the monsters roaming the castle are connected. Although his father doesn't trust him, Duke is determined to save Neugier.

	<name>Ou-chan no Oekaki Logic</name>
	<desc>Ou-chan no Oekaki Logic is a digital conversion, with anime mascots, of the classic Japanese newspaper puzzle nonograms. A nonogram is a puzzle on a square or rectangular grid the object of which is to reveal a hidden picture. Along each row and column there is a number or series of numbers which indicate how many squares will be colored in that row or grid. Example; &amp;quot;5 9 4&amp;quot; would mean there would be sets of five, nine, and four colored squares in the grid, in that order, with at least one blank in between. 

Ou-chan no Oekaki Logic adds a story mode where Ou-Chan, representing the player, competes with other blobby anime characters in finding hidden images in the nonogram grids.</desc>

	<name>Tetris Attack</name>
	<desc>All is not well on Yoshi's Island! The devious king Bowser has cast a spell on the island's inhabitants, turning them into his mindless slaves. Only Yoshi has escaped its effects, and so he must set off to free his friends, and to defeat Bowser and break the spell.

Tetris Attack is a fact-paced action puzzler featuring the colorful cast of characters from Yoshi's Island. A stack of blocks continually rises from the bottom of the screen, and the player controls a cursor which can swap any two blocks horizontally. Make a row or column of three or more and they'll clear, potentially creating combos from new blocks falling to take their place. Combos will send large garbage blocks to your opponent, which must be eliminated by clearing a piece that is touching it, turning it into normal blocks.

The game offers a story mode against the computer, as well as a 2-player versus mode, an endless mode, a timed mode where a certain number of blocks must be cleared, and a puzzle mode where a set arrangement of blocks must be cleared in a specific number of moves. The game is based on the Japan-only title Panel de Pon.</desc>

	<path>./Pipe Dream (Japan).zip</path>
	<name>Pipe Dream</name>
	<desc>Each level of this abstract puzzler challenges the player to set up a network of pipes to allow an unspecified substance known as 'flooz' to flow through as many of those as possible. The pieces are offered in random order, and there are seven different types - straight lines going horizontally or vertically, corners rotating in each of the four directions, and cross-over pieces which carry the flooz straight across horizontally and vertically. Each of these can be entered from either side. When the flooz hits a gap, or a piece which the previous piece can't flow into, the pipe is finished.

Before the flooz starts flowing from its randomly-selected starting position, the player has several seconds to start placing pieces. They can be put down anywhere. However a situation that can often occur is there will be a long and complex piping arrangement set up, yet a gap somewhere remains to be filled. Players are able to replace a piece with another in the same square (to make it easier to flow the flooz that way), but for a slight scoring penalty.

Bonuses are awarded for looping the flooz through both sides of at least 5 cross-over pieces, or passing the flooz through every square on the screen. Later levels have some squares on the grid blocked off, a few gaps in the side-wall (allowing flooz to thread to the other side of the screen). After every four levels there is a bonus game for points, in which the player can only place the pieces in the lowest open space in each column, similarly to the board game of "Connect 4".</desc>

	<name>Popful Mail</name>
	<desc>In this platform action game, you play as a cute bounty hunter known as Popful Mail. While you might think that a cute Anime chick would have no trouble making a living slashing bad guys with her sword, Popful is having a hard time making ends meet.  One day, however, Popful learns about a magician who has gone rogue and has a hefty bounty on his head. So, her adventure begins as Popful fights her way through a new adventure, and makes new friends along the way.

Primarily this is an action game with very slight RPG elements. As you make your way through the plethora of levels, you will have to collect money from slain foes. You use this money in the shops to buy weapons, armor, health, and so on. Also, this game features interaction with many, many characters through both on-screen dialog and fully animated sequences. Some of these characters become playable as you progress through the game.

This release has the same story and general gameplay style as the earlier version, but otherwise was made from scratch, having entirely different graphics, locations, enemies, challenges, etc.</desc>

	<path>./Ranma 1-2 - Akanekodan Teki Hihou (Japan) (Translated En).zip</path>
	<name>Ranma 1/2 : Hidden Treasure of the Crimson Cats</name>
	<desc>The game is based on the animÃ© series Ranma 1/2. It tells the story of the young martial artist Ranma Saotome. Traveling with his father Genma across China, Ranma discovered a cursed spring. When he and his father fell into that spring, they were both transformed: Ranma into a little girl, Genma into a panda bear. Hot water restored them to their original appearance, but whenever they are splashed with cold water, they turn into their "cursed" forms. 

The story of the game begins as Ranma and Genma are having breakfast by their friends. Suddenly, several cat-like creatures burst in and kidnap Genma. Ranma finds out that the cats belonged to Akaneko (Crimson Cat) Gang, who kidnaps strong fighters for some reason. Soon Ranma discovers that Kamusaru, the leader of the Crimson Cat Gang, is looking for an ancient treasure that will allow him to turn into a Nekomaou (Cat Demon King), and take over the world. Ranma and his friends will do anything to rescue Genma and to stop Kamusaru's evil plans!

The game features many characters from the animÃ©, including Ranma's fiancee Akane, the fighter Ryouga, the amazon warrior Shampoo who is in love with Ranma, and others. The game is built like a traditional Japanese RPG: your party fights random enemies in turn-based combat viewed from a third-person, Final Fantasy-like perspective. In battles, you can attack physically, or use various offensive and defensive techniques, which consume "ki" (an equivalent of magic points). Not only Ranma and Genma, but also the other characters in your parties can take a different shape. You carry around a bucket of cold water, and every time you use it on one of your characters, he/she is transformed into a "cursed" form. This is sometimes required to advance the story of the game (for example, Ranma can enter a certain location only as a girl).

	<name>Ranma 1/2 : Hard Battle</name>
	<desc>Another fighting game based on the Ranma 1/2 manga series set around the misadventures of a martial artist that gets cursed and magically transforms into a female version of himself whenever he's splashed with water.

As in previous games the premise simply involves the cast of the series going at each other's throats for ultimate supremacy, although this time you can select any character in either the single player or Vs gameplay modes.

The gameplay itself involves controlling your character in a side-scrolling arena and trying to defeat your opponent either with your basic attacks, special moves (triggered by specific controller motions) or super moves that require you to charge buttons and can only be dealt under specific situations (ie, when your life-bar starts flashing), while avoiding your opponent's attacks in turn.

	<name>Ranma 1/2 : Chougi Ranbu Hen</name>
	<desc>A 2D one-on-one fighting game based on the Ranma 1/2 manga series dealing with the adventures of a male martial artist cursed to transform into a female version of himself when splashed with water.

Ranma 1/2 : Chougi Ranbu Hen pits 12 characters from the series (including the male and female versions of Ranma) against each other in best 2-out-of-3 rounds matches, with the goal being to defeat all the opponents and thus claim a magical lucky cat that will grant the champion whatever he wishes.

Gameplay involves controlling your character in a 2D scrolling arena, in which you attempt to defeat your opponent by using your basic attacks and special moves, all the while avoiding your opponent's strikes. You can also charge up your character until he reaches "super" mode, which allows you to unleash super moves for extra damage, but performing any basic attack negates the super mode.

Features the standard single player and Vs modes along with a Tag Team Vs mode in which two players select a pair of characters and can exchange them in mid-fight for strategic advantage.</desc>

	<name>Ranma 1/2 : Ougi Jaanken</name>
	<desc>The game involves falling blocks of hands displaying the rock, paper, and scissors signs, which fall three at a time. In a similar manner to Tetris, the player can rotate the blocks to stack them, using pieces that defeat other pieces (e.g. paper over rock) to eliminate stacks. Doing so adds garbage pieces onto the opponent's screen to make it more difficult for them to eliminate their stacks of blocks. The objective is to fill up the opponent's screen up with blocks so that additional ones can no longer fit. Each character has two special attacks which can be used when large combinations are completed. Once in each round each player can also use a bucket of water that can transform a cursed character into their alternate form, which weakens their attacks until the effect wears off. This does not affect Akane or the Gambling King.</desc>

	<desc>Multidirectionally scrolling action shooter. The main character runs through science fiction scenarios blasting away everything that moves. Starting with only a single shot,  5 different upgradable weapon systems can be collected as extras. Upon death, the last activated system loses one increment of its current upgrade status, but can be refueled by additional extras collected. Every weapon has also a massive 'smart' bomb feature, wiping out mostly everything on screen at once if invoked. There are also some R-Type style space shooter levels thrown in for good measurement. Very arcady with tons of action. Several boss monsters per level. Level progress is saved via password feature.

But remember, Dr. Wily is mad, but he's not stupid. He had a backup plan...and all he had to do was just wait...

6 months had passed, and somewhere from deep within Wily's abandoned lab, 4 hidden capsules activated and opened. His backup plan was in action...he had hidden 4 new Wily Robots that would spring him out of jail so he could continue his mad reign.

When Mega Man hears the word that Wily was busting out of prison, he rushes onto the scene, only to encounter a strange robot he had never seen before named Bass. Bass tells Mega Man to back off, that he would stop Wily, and that Mega Man was no longer needed.

Think that's gonna stop Mega Man? No way! Mega Man takes off to put a stop to Dr. Wily and find out exactly whose side Bass is on...</desc>

	<path>./Romancing SaGa (Japan) [En by Trans Dimension v0.40] (Incomplete).zip</path>
	<name>Romancing SaGa</name>
	<desc>Once upon a time, three evil gods fought against the holy gods, and the holy God-Father chose a human warrior to help them. Finally, after a prolonged, terrible war, the leader of the three evil gods - Death, the eldest of them - surrendered. The youngest evil god, Schirach, became a human and has lost her powers. The middle one, Saruin, was sealed away in the dark world. Now, after thousand years have passed, and the seal of Saruin has weakened, it is time for you, the hero of the new generation, to defeat him.

Romancing SaGa is the fourth installment in the long SaGa series - non-linear role-playing games with several main heroes. It is the first of three Super Nintendo entries. The first three games in the series were on the Gameboy and were known as "Final Fantasy Legend" outside of Japan. In this game, you play the stories of eight characters, which will later unite to face the ultimate evil. The eight characters belong to different classes and have different abilities. There are four male characters (noble son, thief, adventurer, and pirate), and four female ones (nomad, ranger, dancer, and savage). The combat is turn-based, with enemies visible on screen. Taking a cue from Final Fantasy II on the NES, instead of "Leveling" your character as a whole you level specific abilities such as a type of weapon or magic, as well as, stats such as HP and Strength and Intelligence. New to this entry abilities are randomly unlocked during battle as a light-bulb appears over the characters head and the new ability is unleashed to the surprise of friend and foe. This serendipitous element of gameplay along with the multiple heroes to choose from greatly enhance the replay value as no two playthroughs are alike. Which is good considering the steep learning curve of the SaGa games which require multiple playthroughs to truly master the system.

"Romancing SaGa" was never released outside of Japan until the Playstation 2 remake "Romancing SaGa: Minstrel Song"</desc>

	<desc>Every 300 years the Death Eclipse kills all newly born creatures. Men, women, and children, animals and plants, even ferocious monsters - no one can survive the devastation caused by the Eclipse. No one except a child chosen by the destiny. 600 years ago, such a child survived the Death Eclipse, only to become a demon king. During the next Eclipse, a chosen child became a holy king, and he defeated the evil demon king. Now, when the next Eclipse is nearing, nobody knows who the next fortunate survivor will become - a demon or a holy man?

In "Romancing SaGa 3", you can play through the story controling any one of the eight main characters - Julian, Monica, Mikhael, Harid, Katarina, Thomas, Elena, and Sarah. The story is common for all eight characters, and they often join together and share the same piece of a story. The princess Monica learns about a rebellion planned by a treacherous Baron to dethrone her brother, Marquis Mikhael. She goes to warn him, but on her way, she loses her horse, and has to stop in an inn of the town Shinnon. There, she meets travelers who agree to lend her a horse and accompany her to see her brother. When they finally reach Mikhael, a war begins...

"Romancing SaGa 3" has a refined upgrading system: you can upgrade your weapons and your spells by using them continuously. The party combat is turn-based, and there are also strategic army-vs.-army battles you'll have to command.</desc>

	<name>Rudra no Hihou</name>
	<desc>The Earth is ruled by heavenly powers, who destroy it and create it again every 4000 years, to end the live of powerful races and to let new ones appear. Many years ago, four great races dominated the Earth: the wise Danans, the beautiful Mermaids, the proud Reptiles, and the strong Giants. But those races had to give place to a newly born race: the humans. During the era of the humans, the planet's air has become filled with smog and the water dirty with pollutants. The cult of the Rudra have appeared and begun fortelling the end of the world. As the 4000 year deadline approaches, three characters each embark on their separate yet intertwined quests.

Sion is a young warrior who wants to take part in a ritual tournament and become the strongest of the kingdom. However a capture of one of the Cultists of Rudras soon complicates his training.

Surlet is a wise magician who is interested in archeology and history of the Earth. He is also a pupil of the famous professor Muench who recently made a very important discovery regarding ancient ruins

Riza is a young druid who lives with her grandfather in a quiet village. She was born with a mysterious jade on her forehead, and now feels the urge to save the world from an inevitable, yet unknown disaster.

Rundra no Hiho is a turn-based RPG, similar in gameplay and graphics to the better known Final Fantasy VI. Whenever players load the game cartridge, they are able to choose which of the three characters they wish to play. This allows any one of these quests to be saved and put aside for any amount of time, allowing the player to change between characters as they so desire. Regardless of which character is chosen, the game is displayed as a top-view on the overworld and in towns. Players can move around to different locations, search treasure chests and talk to townspeople. On the overworld and in dungeons, random encounters can occur. During battles the game is displayed from a side-view and is turn-based between the player's characters and monsters. Players are able to Fight with their weapon, use mantras (magic), use items, defend or run away. Defeat of monsters will result in the party earning experience points and money, which can be spent to buy new weapons, armor and items.

The game's mantra (magic) system is unique in that all spells are formed up of syllables, each with it's own effect (for instance, the syllable "Ig" represents fire and the syllable "ga" augments any mantra's power over it's basic form. Therefore "Igga" is a more powerful version than "Ig" alone). Syllables must be arranged in proper combinations in order to form effective magic spells. Hints towards some of these combinations can be found inside treasure chests or by talking to townspeople.

Many of the problems that existed in the first game have been fixed in this installment (it is easier to execute special moves, you no longer have only Ryo or Robert to choose from in 1 player mode, etc.).

The entire cast from the first Art of Fighting is here (with the exceptions of Todo and Mr. Karate), along with a few new characters: Takuma Sakazaki, Ryo and Yuri's father; Yuri Sakazaki, Takuma's daughter and Ryo's sister; Eiji Kisaragi, a sworn enemy of the Sakazakis; Temjin, a Mongolian trucker; and a younger version of Geese Howard, whom you face as the last boss if you beat the game without losing a round.</desc>

	<name>Seiken Densetsu 3</name>
	<desc>Seiken Densetsu 3 is set in the same world as the two previous Seiken Densetsu games (the first is Final Fantasy Adventure, and the second is most known as Secret of Mana). The mysterious power of Mana is also the center of all events in Seiken Densetsu 3. Years have passed, and all the destructive powers of Mana have been securely sealed by Mana Swords into eight seeds, all placed in eight different kingdoms. But some people know about those sealed powers, and they don't want to free them for the sake of humanity, but for their own gain - such as the kingdom of Altena, which is slowly freezing and which can be saved only by the legendary powers.

The game features several plot lines connected to each other by their common background. In the beginning of the game, you are offered to choose a group of three among six different characters of different classes: Duran the Fighter, Angela the Magic User, Lisa the Amazon, Carlie the Cleric, Kevin the Grappler and Hawk the Thief. Each one of them has her/his own background story and dwells in a different land. Gradually, the connections between those different characters become apparent, and the seemingly loose story lines are connected into a whole.

Seiken Densetsu 3, like the previous game of the series, is an action RPG, with real time combat.</desc>

	<desc>A 2D side-scrolling beat 'em up, Sengoku casts you and a friend as two renegade fighters out to beat the crap out of the many assorted gangs that threaten the post-apocalyptic cities of the future. Unfortunately for them they also get caught in a time-warping scheme caused by the evil Nobunaga who attempts to invade the time period with mythical warriors and evil creatures from the Japanese sengoku period.

The game thus takes you from the city to a spirit-realm from time to time, in which you must fight all sorts of Japanese mythical figures, and release three haunted spirits that can aid you in your battle. Collecting orbs from defeated enemies allows you heal up, gain weapons and even energy attacks and also summon the warrior forms of the spirits you released, which change your character's form and give you a new collection of attacks and powers.

	<name>Shin Megami Tensei</name>
	<desc>A young man lives together with his mother in Kichijoji, a district in modern Tokyo. One day, he has a strange dream: he is being sucked into another dimension, a strange maze-like structure. A spirit appears in front of him and asks him his name. As he proceeds further, he meets a man who is hanging on a cross, another one who is being tormented by a demon, and a mysterious young woman who is bathing in a pool...

"Wake up!" - the voice of his mother cuts through the dream. The young man wakes up and checks his computer. Suddenly, a message arrives: the world is headed towards destruction. Only he who can summon demons through a virtual space will be able to prevent a disaster. What could that mean? The young man goes outside and finds out a murder has occurred in the nearby park. The district must be cut off from the rest of the city until the murderer is found. This was the beginning of the demon summoner's story...

"Shin Megami Tensei" is a first-person RPG set in modern-day and futuristic Tokyo. The hero of the game can summon demons, who use a mysterious energy called Magnetite. The demons can fight for you and perform other useful tasks. The first-person combat is turn-based. In the beginning of the game, you can set the statistics of your party members, determining their strength, stamina, intelligence, etc. You'll need to make some crucial decisions during the game, that will also influence the outcome of its events.</desc>

	<name>Shin Megami Tensei II</name>
	<desc>Shin Megami Tensei II is a direct sequel to the  first game. The events of this game take place 20 or 30 years after the hero of the first game followed the neutral path, defeated the Asura Lord and the seraph Michael at the Cathedral, and founded a state where followers of both Law and Chaos ideals could live freely. But his reign of freedom doesn't last long. The Mesia faith gains power, expanding the Cathedral into a new enclosed environment named Millenium. The Gaians rise up, but their rebellion is repressed by the Mesians' elite warrior class, the Temple Knights. Some years later, a retired arena fighter Okamoto discovers a man fighting for his life against a demon. He rescues the man, who doesn't even remember his own name, and trains him to fight in the arena so they might both go on to a better living in one of the upper-class areas of Millenium. And thus the new battle for a better future begins...

"Shin Megami Tensei II" features all the gameplay innovations of the previous game. You can summon demons, fuse them, make them battle for you, talk to random enemies and receive information from them, etc. The combat is turn-based, and you explore the dungeons from a first-person perspective view.</desc>

	<name>Shin Nekketsu Kouha Kunio-kun: Kunio-tachi no Bank</name>
	<desc>Another beat 'em up in the Nekketsu Kouha Kunio-Kun series. 
The eternal rebel Kunio and his pal Riki finally get to face the long arm of the law when they get both arrested for killing a couple of bystanders in a hit-and-run incident. Problem is they are innocent and the lookalike killers are still out there! Kunio and his pal now have to break out of the prison and go kick some butt in the name of justice (and to clear their names of course).

Gameplay involves defeating all opponents using your arsenal of attacks and special moves (as well as any weapons you may find around) and completing the many side scrolling stages that make up the game, usually after beating an end level boss.

Kunio and Riki are not alone in their quest, as their hard boiled girlfriends, Misako and Kyouko, can join up and provide their unique collection of special moves to the mix. Biking sequences in which you try to get to another part of town while fending-off opponents Road Rash-style are also added for additional gameplay and the game uses several non-interactive cutscenes and dialogues to carry the plot forward.</desc>

	<name>Shounen Ashibe</name>
	<desc>Shounen Ashibe: Goma-chan no Yuuenchi Daibouken (lit: "Boy Ashibe: Goma-chan's Great Amusement Park Adventure") is a Super Famicom platformer from Nova Co. and Takara. The player alternates between controlling the human Ashibe, as he escorts his friends across a world map while talking to NPCs and following the game's story, and the seal Goma-chan in 2D platformer stages where he must track down eight items by investigating his surroundings thoroughly. While Goma-chan can't be hurt by enemies, colliding with them causes him to lose one of the eight items he's already found - as the stages have a strict time limit, it's best to avoid this situation whenever possible.

Shounen Ashibe was originally a Shounen Jump serialized manga before becoming an anime TV series in 1991, a year before this game was released.</desc>

	<name>Shounen Ninja Sasuke</name>
	<desc>Shounen Ninja Sasuke ("Boy Ninja Sasuke") is a comedic brawler published by SunSoft exclusively for the Super Famicom. The player, as the eponymous ninja, must rescue the daughter of a local lord by fighting his way through hordes of masked bandits led by a mysterious warlord. A second player can join in as Sasuke's monk friend Chin-nan. The game has a distinct sense of speed and verticality, and it's recommended that the player(s) try running and jumping around performing aerial attacks rather than staying on the ground and getting quickly swarmed by enemies.The game was published by SunSoft and developed by an unknown developer, though Mint is thought to have contributed to its sound design. A US SNES localization, with the title Boy Ninja Sasuke, was briefly considered but then axed.</desc>

	<path>./Slayers (Japan) (Translated En).zip</path>
	<name>Slayers</name>
	<desc>"Slayers" is based on an manga series of the same name (also known as Lina the Teenage Sorceress). The heroine of the manga (and of the game) is Lina Inverse, a seventeen-year-old girl who can use magic and is also proficient with the sword. Lina particularly likes money, and often robs rich people and hunts for treasure. She also has a sense for justice - if a village or a town is in trouble, Lina will do anything to protect it and to fight the bad guys! In the game, Lina is knocked down after a fight against mysterious attackers, and is found by the inhabitants of the nearby village. The trouble is, she can't remember anything! When she meets her long-time companion Naga, their first objective become to investigate the goblin attacks on the population, but Lina's ultimate quest is to regain her memory and to find out who or what has attacked her.

The game is a traditional console-style RPG with towns, dungeons, random enemies, and turn-based combat viewed from first-person perspective, in a Dragon Warrior fashion. The characters can attack physically or use special attacks. Lina can also cast various magical spells. You cannot travel on the world map, but "jump" to various locations instead. The game features animé-style cut scenes.</desc>

	<desc>The game is a less of a self-contained game and more a collection of four smaller ones; including a point-and-click segment featuring Schroeder. The player controls Woodstock and direct Snoopy as he performs all sorts of errands for different Peanuts characters. The player does a separate game for each character; some of them require him to do a little detective work, or to direct Snoopy to win a race, or to get a character to some place. The ultimate goal in the game is to get everyone in shape for Snoopy's concert. Games can either be played using stereo or monoaural sound.

The music was composed by Hirokazu Tanaka (?????)[2] and Minako Hamano (??????),[2] in addition to arrangements of the familiar works of Vince Guaraldi known to longtime Peanuts fans. Many years later the game has been translated to English (by Aeon Genesis) and Portuguese.</desc>

	<desc>A puzzle spin-off title from the Ganbare Goemon series. Goemon has been captured and his friend Ebisumaru goes out to try to find and rescue him. In order to do so, he must traverse a series of maze-like levels avoiding obstacles and enemies and get to the end zone.

The game is played from an isometric perspective from which you can get a good view of the mazes and Ebisumaru. You have no direct control of Ebisumaru per se, but instead switch special blocks around the mazes that can change Ebisumaru's direction of travel and such. You must reach the end of each stage before time runs out, and get all the power-ups and items laid in each maze in hopes of getting to Goemon alive.</desc>

	<name>Super Bomberman 5</name>
	<desc>The fifth and final Bomberman released for the SNES (so far).  This game is very similar to Super Bomberman 3 and 4.  Again there is a new story and new battle arenas but other than that it is the same game.  Players choose between the bosses of the story game levels in battle games like in Super Bomberman 4 yet they have not special powers this time around.</desc>

	<name>Super Fire Pro Wrestling - Queen's Special</name>
	<desc>Long before the WWE introduced the Divas wrestling matches, in Japan there was a more serious affair, where wrestling skill was more important than breast implants, and matches were "real" (as far as wrestling goes) instead of pillow-fighting or bra and panties fights.

In this game in the Fire Pro Series, the cast of the All Japan Women's Pro-Wrestling promotion are available, all fighting to win the Red belt, the highest prize of the federation. It's also possible to fight in single matches, tournaments, Battle Royal and Elimination matches. The usual array of options in CAW is present, being possible to create 16 new Wrestlers.

Gameplay, as usual is the series, is dramatically different than in most western games. Each wrestler has a bunch of moves, ranked from weak to strong. While it's possible to connect any of them from open situations, while grappling only when the opponent is already beaten the most powerful moves can be successfully used.

	<name>Super Fire Pro Wrestling Premium X</name>
	<desc>In this final appearance of Fire Pro series on 16-bit consoles, the usual roster of over 150 wrestlers from several wresting promotions worldwide including several styles from Shoot or Pancrase to American and Lucha are joined by 80 Create-a-wrestler slots, plus secret wrestlers such as legends Gotch or Thesz or the roster of Blazing Tornado. While all fighters have fictional names, a lot of them are perfectly recognizable by their attire, stance and style. The CAW mode allows the player to create a wrestler from scratch, setting how they look (choosing face, size, clothing and setting colours) and fight, with several styles and stances available, as well as over 500 moves, each more suitable for certain styles and skills. To make them fight more realistically when controlled by the AI, the CAW mode also allows one to set move priorities.

Five game modes are available, including World Championship (single and tag), Battle Royale, 5-man Elimination Mode, League Battle and the One Night Dream Match. There are several referees available (each with their own quirks) and variant rules, from allowing fighting outside the ring without count-out (or disallowing it) to the disabling of disqualifications from illegal moves.</desc>

Tubes of random shapes drop on to a board, and by rotating and placing them you have to make shapes that join up in loops. Once you have placed a piece you can't remove it, except by using a special items which destroy every part of an incomplete loop it touches; every tenth loop takes you to a new level.</desc>

	<path>./Super Nazo Puyo - Rulue no Roux (Japan).zip</path>
	<name>Super Nazo Puyo - Rulue no Roux</name>
	<desc>A spin-off of the successful action puzzle series Puyo Puyo with a twist. Whereas the main Puyo Puyo games are aimed at defeating AI or human controlled opponents in puzzle duels (where each player has his own play area in which color-coded "puyos" fall and must clear them out faster than his opponent). Nazo Puyo instead challenges the player with different single-player scenarios in which a specific objective must be completed (such as clearing only the red Puyos, or performing a specific sequence of combos, etc.).

The game uses the mold of a top-down RPG in which you control the young magician Arle as she explores towns and dungeons in her search for adventure. Each quest involves finding an NPC who will trigger one of the aforementioned scenarios and rewards Arle with experience points and unique items that increase her stats.

	<desc>Sequel to the original Super Nazo Puyo, SNP2 is a Puyo Puyo spin-off which combines arcade puzzle elements with RPG gameplay.

You play as the young magician Arle as she sets out looking for adventure all over the land, chatting with NPCs and exploring the game world via a standard top-down RPG interface. Quests involve careful exploration and solving Nazo Puyo challenges which involve specific scenarios of puzzle-based gameplay which the player must solve under a specific timeframe. These sequences give the player a play area in which color-coded "puyos" are pre-arranged in different patterns, and the player must position and arrange the ones that start to fall in order to fullfil the objective at hand (clear only a certain row or color of puyos, reach a certain number of combos, etc.). Additionally, running into specific monsters can trigger standard Puyo Puyo duels, in which both players have their own play areas and the objective is to clear the screen faster than the opponent.

	<desc>Super Sokoban (or Soukoban) is a puzzle game in which the player must push crates around a maze to their designated storage area, ensuring they do not accidentally push a crate into a position where it cannot be recovered. Thinking Rabbit created the original game in 1982 on home computers, and Super Sokoban is the first Super Famicom game to follow the same blueprint.

The intro establishes that the eponymous Sokoban, or warehouse worker, must perform enough box-pushing puzzles to earn enough cash for a flashy new car so that he might finally impress the girl of his dreams.

An added wrinkle is that each stage has a fixed move limit, and so the player must not only push the boxes in the right order but do so with maximum efficiency. The game was not released outside of Japan.</desc>

	<name>Super Tetris 2 + Bombliss</name>
	<desc>Super Tetris 2 + Bombliss is one of the many versions of the famous soviet puzzle game, the first one available for the Super Nintendo, and an updated version of Tetris 2 + Bombliss.

As the title would suggest, the game features both standard Tetris as well as another similar game called Bombliss. Tetris offers three game modes: standard marathon (A-type), start with garbage (B-type), and rising garbage (C-type). There is also a two-player versus mode where clearing rows sends garbage to the other player.

Bombliss is slightly different from normal Tetris. Arranged on the board and in some dropped pieces are bomb squares. Completing a row does not clear the blocks in the row, but will trigger any bombs in the row which will destroy blocks. Different sizes of bombs will generate larger explosions. Bombliss is offered in standard marathon mode, a puzzle mode where a set board must be cleared using set piece drops, and a 2-player versus mode.</desc>

	<name>Super Tetris 3</name>
	<desc>Super Tetris 3 is yet another version of the famous soviet puzzle game. However, despite what the title may suggest, contained within are actually four different versions of Tetris: Tetris Classic, Familiss, Sparkliss, and Magicaliss. Tetris Classic, of course, is the basic version of the game, which comes with an endless mode and a 25-line "standard" mode. Familiss, as the name might suggest, is a family mode for up to four players simultaneously. Sparkliss, meanwhile, is very similar to Bombliss from Super Tetris 2, only with a medieval fantasy theme and different explosion patterns. Sparkliss includes both a stage mode and a puzzle mode.

The most unique mode is Magicaliss, which has never shown up on any other version of Tetris. In Magicaliss, pieces come in three basic colors, and by rotating the piece, the player can choose between them. Creating a line entirely out of one color will clear all blocks on the screen of that color. There are also grey pieces, which can only be cleared by creating a line made entirely from one color, which will cause all grey blocks on screen to become that color. There are also rare rainbow pieces which will act as any color. Besides these additions, the game itself is basic Tetris.

Tetris Classic, Sparkliss, and Magicaliss can also be played in a two-player battle mode, besides the four-player Familiss mode.</desc>

	<name>Tales of Phantasia</name>
	<desc>In "Tales of Phantasia", you play a young boy named Cless, who lives together with his parents in a quiet village. It was a day like all the others when Cless decided to go hunting with his best friend Chester. Chasing a wild boar, Cless discovered a strange talking tree in the forest who was pleading him for help. But as soon as it stopped speaking, the two friends heard the sound of an alarm. They returned to the village and found it burnt down, and all its inhabitants murdered. Before Cless' mother died in his arms, she told him this terrible massacre had something to do with the pendant she and her husband gave Cless for his birthday... what connection could there be? Cless decides to visit his uncle who lives in another town, but he doesn't realize his journey will take him to much more remote places than that!

"Tales of Phantasia" presents a unique combat system: The battles have a lot in common with fighting games: you fight on a platform that slowly scrolls forward and have to attack your enemy in real time. Other party members are controlled by AI. You can pause the game at any time and use magic, items, or choose an overall strategy for your allies.</desc>

	<name>Tenchi Muyou ! Game-Hen</name>
	<desc>Sasami is kidnapped by a mysterious little girl with magical powers, and Tenchi and his companions must travel to rescue her, battling monsters and other creatures on the way.

Tenchi Muyou! Game-Hen is a strategy game with RPG elements, based on the popular Japanese Tenchi Muyo! cartoon series. The game moves from battle to battle, with the plot being revealed through cutscenes between them. The player fights the computer on turns, controlling the individuals from a party of four. The party members are selected on a separate screen before each battle, and as the game progresses new characters become available.

During the skirmish, selecting the characters brings up a menu with three command options: move, attack or end turn. A fourth transform option becomes available later, after they reach a higher level. When moving or attacking, glowing tiles on the ground show the maximum range of the action. Performing either one costs action points, shown as eight regenerating green dots on the status window, alongside basic statistics like health, defense and attack levels. Characters level up automatically while on the battlefield, increasing their abilities and receiving more powerful attacks. Health powers are also accessed through the attack menu, recovering lost points to an ailing comrade within their range. Characters can transform to a more powerful version when they have the ability to do so, and all the eight green dots are still available. The transformed unit has more powerful attacks and a wider range of movement.

After the battle, a map screen appears where the player can save the game, and choose the next battle from one of the available paths. It is possible to revisit battlegrounds, to level up before tackling stronger enemies.

	<name>Torneko no Daibouken - Fushigi no Dungeon</name>
	<desc>Torneko (aka Taloon) from Dragon Quest IV was a merchant and treasure hunter who always dreamed of owning his own shop. Having defeating the evil along with other heroes, he returned to Endor to work peacefully. Some time has passed and after growing successful in this town, Torneko grew anxious. Hearing rumors one day about a "Mysterious Dungeon", Torneko meets with the king to ask permission to set up a new shop, closer to this Mysterious Dungeon. By exploring this cavern and returning safely with the prizes, Torneko hopes to become the most successful merchant in the world.

Torneko No Daibouken is a overhead view game similar to Hack, what might be called a "dungeon crawl". Torneko must venture into the mysterious dungeon gathering treasure. He may equip any weapons and shields he finds there, as well as gather up items such as spell scrolls, staffs and herbs with a variety of effect. A variety of enemies, familiar to the Dragon Quest series, await him. If Torneko successfully exits the dungeon, he is able to sell any of the items he has collected. This money then goes to improve the quality of his shop and living quarters. As the game progresses, Torneko is able to store special items in the vault, which he is then able to bring with him on subsequent trips to the dungeon.</desc>

	<name>Treasure Hunter G</name>
	<desc>Brothers Red and Blue G. decide to leave their idyllic village in search of their long lost father, who left the kids years ago to go treasure hunting. Unfortunately, as soon as they begin their quest, they become entangled with a mysterious girl on the run from evil monsters who holds the key to the resurrection of a great demon. Now its up to the brothers to save the world if they ever want to find their father.

Treasure Hunter G is a top-down RPG in which you control your party of four characters as they explore the fantasy/sci-fi game world in search for quests and grinding their stats while the plot advances. The game is divided in a world-map screen, a top-down "town" mode and a turn-based fight mode in which the characters are taken to generic tiled top-down arenas in which they select each character and move or attack depending on their action points.

Enemies can be seen on the map instead of jumping at you at random intervals, and you can freely decide whether to engage them or simply circle them around. The game uses a combination of hand-drawn sprites and CGI pre-rendered one (mostly for the main characters) with a distinct cute or Super Deformed design (as usual for most console RPGs).</desc>

	<name>Uch no Kishi: Tekkaman Blade</name>
	<desc>Uchu no Kishi: Tekkaman Blade's is based on the anime Tekkaman Blade, also known as Teknoman. The game's levels are a mix of scrolling shooter and fighting game. The first part of every level is a scrolling shooter where Tekkaman Blade must survive several waves of Radam before killing two stronger boss-like Radam and meeting another Tekkaman. In scrolling shooter levels Blade can either toss his spear to defeat enemies at range or quickly slash with it to destroy bullets and enemies. One enemy type will drop different colored System Box powerups: green restores health, red destroys all enemies onscreen (except bosses), and blue turns Blade invulnerable and able to destroy all enemies upon contact (including bosses).

The end of every level is a one on one fight with an enemy Tekkaman. Each Tekkaman starts with a weapon, but the weapon will be lost if they take too much damage, forcing them to use punches and kicks. This mode can also be played in 2-player mode, where each player selects their Tekkaman.</desc>

They must fight every lackey and vanquish Dr. Clayborn in order to restore law and order to the city. 

Go through the game's five stages, defeating enemies along the way and destroying the end-of-level boss before proceeding to the next stage. Along the way, weapons such as fish, rocks, i-beams, cars, and more can be used.</desc>

	<path>./Wonder Project J - Kikai no Shounen Pino (Japan) (Translated En).zip</path>
	<name>Wonder project J</name>
	<desc>There was once a great scientist and inventor named Gepetto, who lived on an island farm together with his creations, his robotic helper, the pixie Tinker, and his pet animals. His greatest creation was an artificial boy named Pino. No, he was not carved from wood, but looked just like a real boy - only he could turn his head 360 degrees. But Gepetto was arrested for an unknown reason. The boy Pino looks like a real boy, but he was completed just a few moments ago, and he knows absolutely nothing. All he can do is wander aimlessly, poking objects and turning his head. It is up to you, the player, to make Pino a real man!

In this simulation/role-playing game, you must use the robotic pixie Tinker to educate Pino. You can move Tinker around, examining objects and collecting them in an adventure-like fashion. Pino will automatically follow you to the direction you are facing, but will continue walking until you stop him. He will also pick objects and make his own "experiments" with them. Your goal is to train PIno in various disciplines. His stats can be raised in a RPG style: reading books increases his intelligence, throwing a ball increases his dexterity, and so on. By praising or scolding Pino you will gradually make him understand what should be done and what not.

To play, you move the randomly placed cookies into rows and columns of cookies with similar patterns. When you successfully assemble a row or column of the same cookies, the line will disappear, and you can begin on a new row or column. The "Yoshi" cookie is very special in both the 1-player and the 2-player game. Since the Yoshi Cookie is the key to both games, you must use it wisely.</desc>

	<desc>After having defeated the ultimate evil in his previous adventure, the great hero Adol stands on a sea shore, thinking about the fate of the once peaceful Utopian land of Ys, while the wind is blowing through his red hair. Suddenly, Adol notices a bottle, thrown onto the shore. It contains a letter, written in a foreign language, in which an unknown person asks Adol to come to his land and save it from a mysterious evil. Adol decides to accept the offer, and thus his adventure begins again...

Ys IV: Mask of the Sun is an action RPG with a combat system like the earlier Ys games. An enemy should be rammed from the sides in order to hurt him. If performed incorrectly, the player will get hurt himself. It's also possible to use magic and position oneself strategically in battle so that the enemy won't be able to inflict any damage.

	<desc>YuYu Hakusho is a Super Famicom game based on the horror-themed manga and anime about a belligerent young man who dies unexpectedly from being hit by a car and is revived as a "spirit detective" by the rulers of the afterlife, and it becomes his job to investigate ghostly matters in the mortal world. The game is a series of set-piece battles where two opponents build up gauges using the D-pad and one of the face buttons: each combination leads to a separate attack and requires a different amount of build-up. The player can go through the story mode, which recounts events from the manga, or they can play a "free" mode against opponents of their choice.</desc>

Because the game takes place in the "near future" and it was released in the mid-1990s, the game itself is referring the story of the game to the first decade of the 21st century.

This game received a sequel in the form of Zero4 Champ RR-Z.</desc>

	<name>Acrobat Mission</name>
	<desc>Years ago humanity abandoned the over-polluted Earth to make a new home on Mars. Now, without warning, a mechanical moon has appeared in the skies over Mars, and is raining down destruction on the colonies. A plan is hastily put into action to destroy the moon and its armada of space-craft. Due to the impossible task of surviving a direct assault, the mission is code-named Acrobat Mission.

Your spaceship in Acrobat Mission is capable of firing a single straight ahead shot. By picking up a Wide upgrade, more shots are added that fly off at an angle, and the shot can be charged up to unleash a continuous short range cone of energy. Picking up a Hurricane upgrade will cause bullets to circle you defensively before shooting forward, and charging will store a full round of bullets up to be fired straight ahead all at once. Up to two bombs can be held at once, and if an enemy bullet hits a bomb it will detonate, saving your ship from damage. If your ship is hit, however, then you will have a few seconds to ram it into whatever shot you and take them down with you. Unlike most scrolling shooter games contact with an enemy ship will not kill you, but they can still push you into the path of bullets.

Play takes place over five levels, first of your launch on Mars, then the approach to the moon, and finally infiltrating the base to destroy its core. Each level ends with a unique boss except stage 4, which ends with 3 bosses.</desc>

	<desc>Past and future are connected in a way mortals do not understand...  A star was glowing up in the sky, and the demon god Alcahest appeared, bringing chaos and destruction to the world. A single swordsman stood in defiance. The four powers that protect the world, the Guardians, gave him their power, and with it the swordsman slew the demon and restored peace in the world. 

Thousand years have passed. And a new battle is already on the way. A cruel emperor leads his troops towards conquest. The kingdom of Panakeia is defending itself with the aid of its knights. Once again, the ominous star shines in the sky, indicating the demon's revival. With the help of Alcahest's power, the evil emperor wants to conquer the world. But the new generation also brings the new hero - the brave swordsman Alen. Aided by the Guardians, Alen must stop the Empire's evil plans and to destroy Alcahest once again.

This is an action game with RPG elements. You wander around slaying enemies in real time combat, gathering treasure on the way, and occasionally participating in boss battles. When you gather enough experience from fighting, you gain extra hit points. You can also upgrade your weapons. On the way you'll meet some characters who will join your party for short time, and you'll be able to use their special attacks and magic.</desc>

Jake is one such pilot, drafted into the Pacific States' Marine Corp under the Federation. During his training, the war has grown substantially and upon being assigned to a platoon, he is immediately thrown into combat.

Cybernator is a side scrolling mech combat game and platform game. The player controls Jake as he moves his assault suit left and right on the battlefield. The assault suit can jump and use a jetpack for a short time to increase altitude. The assault suit begins with a Shot machine gun weapon that spreads out fire in front, and a Punch weapon for close melee. Additional weapons can be found during the course of the game and existing weapons improved by the gathering of "P" power-ups, left by defeated enemy. Each level contains a variety of enemies and an end boss which must be destroyed to reach the next level. Some levels take place as horizontally scrolling shooters, in which the Assault suit can move up, down, left and right on the screen... but is constantly advancing towards new threats.</desc>

The king sends his best troops of knights and wizards to face the enemy, but in vain - the kingdom is conquered by Sauzer, the king is murdered, and his lovely daughter is kidnapped. You were brave, Leader of the Dragon Squad, but now you will have to become strong. Remember the promise you gave the princess long time ago: always to be at her side. Supported by his friends and by his faithful dragons, you must now free the princess and the kingdom from the enemy's hands. If only the strongest of the dragons, Bahamut, could be awakened...

Bahamut Lagoon, created by the company which gave us the Final Fantasy games, is a mixture of turn-based strategy and RPG. Control several parties of four characters each, and command different dragons at once. The battles start on a top-down screen typical for strategy games, but often switch to a dynamic "platform" view, such as used in early console RPGs. You also can influence the game by other strategic activities, such as, for example, setting a whole forest on fire, to prevent enemies to come through it.</desc>

	<name>Bakutou Dochers</name>
	<desc>Bakutou Dodgers is a Japan-only action game for up to four players. It superficially resembles Hudson's Bomberman series, with its top-down grid stages and chaotic gameplay, but rather than leaving bombs and waiting for them to explode, the player can shoot energy at blocks and each other.

The goal is to sneak up behind the opponent and shoot them before they can reciprocate. Various power-ups may appear after destructible blocks are removed, which can give the player an edge or, in the case of the ? icon, a possible random negative effect like reversed controls. There are also wandering monsters that can cause damage to anyone they come in contact with. Every combatant has a health bar which depletes at a rate dependent on the attacks they are getting hit by.

The single-player mode involves fighting through various worlds and removing all enemy combatants from the field to progress.</desc>

	<desc>In this game, you're either in the foreground or the background, and your opponent is always on the opposite end of the screen. To fight whoever flies thar yonder in the distance, you send out projectiles, in our case fireballs. These behave differently depending on which of the four main buttons you press: if you press the A button, they fly in a curve towards the upper right part of the screen, if you push the Y button, they go left and down and so on and so forth. Sadly, they move so slowly your opponent has a good three seconds to get out of the way, and in so weird curves that aiming is impossible. Also, the screen constantly twists in all directions.</desc>

	<name>Battle Jockey</name>
	<desc>Battle Jockey is a racing game for up to four players that was developed by Nova and published by Virgin Interactive exclusively in Japan for the Super Famicom.It features horseracing, a far more popular pastime in Japan than elsewhere, and presents three separate modes: the first is the standard single-player story mode, in which the player takes a horse and jockey through training and races; the second is a battle mode which pits up to four players against each other in races that have far more power-ups and other unusual additions to the game's courses; and the third is a passive gambling mode in which the player puts money down on horses depending on their odds of winning and subsequent payouts and then watches the race play out with CPU players.The standard mode involves carefully managing the horse's stamina: being too aggressive will cause it to rear up in protest. Falling behind or running into a hedge or jump will cause the horse to lose stamina, and losing all stamina causes it to collapse briefly. The player needs to keep a steady pace, steer carefully around corners, jump at the right times and use the boost sparingly in order to win. In the battle mode stamina is less of a concern and the game more resembles RC Pro-Am: the players have to simply follow the course and avoid the dangers as they show up.</desc>

	<path>./Bishoujo Senshi Sailor Moon - Another Story (Japan) (Translated En).bin</path>
	<name>Sailor Moon : Another Story</name>
	<desc>The game is based on the Japanese manga and animé series Bishoujo Senshi: Sailor Moon - "Bishoujo Senshi" roughly meaning "Pretty Young Girl Warrior". It is set in the 30th century, in a futuristic city Crystal Tokyo. In this city lives a totally ordinary (at first) fourteen-year old girl Usagi. When she meets a magical cat named Luna, she finds out that she is in fact a princess sent to the future in order to fight the minions of Darkness. She discovers within herself the power to transform into the hero of darkness, Sailor Moon, meets other warriors who help her on her quest, and fights the evil Queen Beryl, hostile aliens, and other foes.

The events of this game take place shortly after Bishoujo Senshi Sailor Moon S, the fourth volume of the long-running series. A global peace is established in the universe, but lately suspicious things are happening. A strange meteorite is seen approaching the Earth. Street gangs and spies who work for a mysterious person called Apsu are seen in Crystal Tokyo. And the Mystic Silver Crystal, the Ginzuishou, which protects the city, is shaking! Usagi and her friends must now investigate the strange events and face the forces of Darkness once again.

The game is a console-style RPG in Final Fantasy style (battles with your party to the right and the enemies to the left), with a battle system somewhat similar to that of Chrono Trigger: you must form a party out of several available characters, make them participate in battles together, and learn powerful combo attacks.

Luna, a magical talking cat, contacts her and tells her she is in fact a Sailor Moon, one of the legendary Pretty Fighters - girls who fight the forces of darkness and protect the Kingdom of Moon. 

The game is based on the events of the animé that follow the victory of Usagi and her friends over the Queen Beryl. Peace has returned to the Moon Kingdom. But suddenly, a little girl named Chibiusa arrives from the future and says the future kingdom is threatened by the forces of the evil Prince Diamond. Looks like you are the only ones who can defeat him, and save the future Sailor Moon, Chibiusa's mother.

This is a beat-'em up game. You can play as either Usagi or any of her girlfriends, including Chibiusa. You move on a platform and fight the enemies by punching, kicking, and throwing them, and by using special abilities unique to each character. You can advance only after you have cleared an area from enemies.

	<name>Sailor Moon S : Kondo wa Puzzle de Oshioki yo</name>
	<desc>Bishoujo Senshi Sailor Moon S: Kondoha Puzzle de Oshiokiyo is a falling block competitive puzzle game. Players begin by choosing from a selection of Sailor Moon licensed characters, each with a unique special attack. The player is presented with a board filled with colored blocks in three colors: red, blue and green. The goal is to remove all the blocks from play. Clicking on a block that touches several adjacent blocks of the same color will remove them all from play. As each player successfully clears blocks, they drop "black blocks" on their opponent as well as increase their power bar. Black blocks cannot be removed by normal means and disappear only when large ammounts of blocks are removed adjacent to them. As the power bar charges, players can unleash their special ability, often an attack on the other player.

This puzzle game is based on the "S" series of Sailor Moon and includes characters from there: Sailor Moon, Sailor Mars, Sailor Venus, Sailor Mercury, Sailor Jupiter, Chibiusa, Tuxedo Mask, Sailor Uranus, Sailor Neptune and Sailor Pluto.

	<name>Sailor Moon S : Kurukkurin</name>
	<desc>Bishoujo Senshi Sailor Moon S: Kurukkurin is a competitive puzzle game featuring Sailor Moon licensed characters. Upon choosing a character (each with unique "special moves"), the player competes against an opponent. Each player controls a grid of 10x6 sections (represented by hearts) initially made up of clear hearts. The player moves their cursor over the clear hearts to turn them into one of four colors: red, yellow, blue and green. Sometimes "treasures" will show up on the board. When several hearts of the same color are adjacent to one another, the player can clear them... which pushes all the hearts (and treasures) down towards the bottom. The goal is to be the player with the most treasures to end the round.

Sailor Moon characters featured are primarily from the "S" Series and includes: Sailor Moon, Sailor Mars, Sailor Mercury, Sailor Venus, Sailor Jupiter, Chibius, Tuxedo Mask, Sailor Neptune, Sailor Uranus and Sailor Pluto.

	<name>Bishoujo Senshi Sailor Moon Super S - Zenin Sanka!! Shuyaku Soudatsusen</name>
	<desc>The game is based on the manga/animÃ© series Sailor Moon. It tells the story of Pretty Sailor Fighters, teenage girls who were summoned to protect the futuristic Moon Kingdom and to fight the forces of darkness, led by the evil Queen Beryl and Prince Diamond. The main heroine is a girl named Tsukino Usagi, who was contacted by the magical talking cat Luna to become Sailor Moon, the leader of the group.

This fighting game is an enhanced version of Bishoujo Senshi Sailor Moon S: Jougai Ranto!? Shuyaku Soudatsusen. Girls compete against each other in tournament mode, story mode, player-vs.-computer mode, and two players mode. They can use physical attacks and magical spells. In story mode you can also upgrade your fighter's attributes (strength, defense power, etc.) New in this expanded version: additional playable characters (hence the title Zen'in Sanka - "Everyone Participates"), different scenes in story mode, additional backgrounds for battles.

	<name>Brandish 2 : The Planet Buster</name>
	<desc>The Planet Buster continues the story that was told in the first Brandish game, and depicts the events that happened three years after the evil demonic king was defeated in his lost kingdom, sunken deep underground. You take control of a young warrior named Ares, who wields a magical weapon, a powerful sword called the Planet Buster. One day, while traveling through a desert, Ares is captured by a warlock named Karl, who is after the powers hidden within the magical sword. Suspecting Ares might have some valuable information, Karl doesn't execute him, but takes away the Planet Buster and throws Ares into his underground prison. Now your primary goal is to guide Ares out of the huge prison full of various dangers, and to get your mighty weapon back.

The game is an action RPG with a heavy emphasis on dungeon crawling. You guide Ares through rotating dungeons, fighting enemies in real-time combat, casting spells, and solving an occasional puzzle. You have the ability to jump forwards and to attack inanimate objects such as doors to cause damage and to break the object.

It is the third game in the series, and the first for the Super Nintendo. As was the case with its forebears, Koutei no Chousen uses a semi-turn-based RPG format in which the player selects commands dependent on whether or not they have possession of the ball. The game follows the story of the manga to some extent.Besides the obvious graphical upgrade moving from 8-bit to 16-bit, Koutei no Chousen now allows the player to see a map of the pitch to help them strategize.</desc>

	<name>Captain Tsubasa J</name>
	<desc>A 1995 Japan-exclusive Captain Tsubasa video game developed and published by Bandai and was the final Captain Tsubasa game for the Super Famicom.
This game suffered lots of changes from previous games made by Tecmo, this time you will be playing in a real soccer field and in real time, which means that you need to press certain keys even without having the chance of stopping the time (like in previous games), When a certain player is confronted with a one that he considers his rival (like Misugi and Schneider or Tsubasa and *any other player*, for example) they will have a fight, which is mainly a button smashing sequence. The same goes for the sequence in which a goalkeeper tries to stop any of the special shots.
This game has almost the same story as the Captain Tsubasa J anime, except that this one will finish with a special match against an extra team. So, you'll play across various chapters, playing with Aoi Shingo in Italy or controlling the mythic Ozora Tsubasa in his match against the brazillian prodigy, Carlos Santana (nope, he isn't the singer). You'll also play with Japan national team against the same opponents as they did in the anime version..</desc>

Starship Hector).All three of these games were the subjects of the Hudson All-Japan Caravan Festival, which for a long time hosted a new Hudson shoot 'em up every year and traveled around Japan with competitors in different prefectures attempting to earn the highest scores. The game would then be available for sale shortly before or after the competition, which helped raise its profile.</desc>

	<name>CB Chara Wars - Ushinawareta Gag</name>
	<desc>CB Chara Wars, sometimes written with the subtitle Ushinawareta Gag, is an RPG that features a crossover of sorts of Go Nagai's various manga franchises. These include Devilman and Mazinger Z, among others. The "CB" in the title refers to the term "chibi", which depicts characters as smaller and cuter than usual. In that sense, it is similar to the term SD (super deformation) found in several Super Famicokm Gundam game titles.CB Chara Wars began as an original video animation which first aired in 1991. A manga adaptation followed the following year, as did this game. Banpresto published the game in Japan, a company known for creating games with anime crossovers such as the Super Robot Taisen/Wars series.</desc>

	<name>Chinhai</name>
	<desc>Chinhai is a puzzle game for the Super Famicom and a variant on Mahjong Solitaire, or Shanghai. Instead of pairing and removing any two tiles that match as long as one of their sides is clear, as is the case in Shanghai, the rules of Chinhai require that the two tiles can only be removed if it's possible to draw a line between the two that doesn't make a 90 degree turn more than twice. Two tiles on opposite sides of the board, for instance, can't be paired because it would take three 90 degree turns to draw a line between them. To account for this added difficulty, the game lacks the "stacks" of tiles that frequently appear in Shanghai, instead presenting a flat board of tiles.Chinhai is named for the municipality of Chinhai in China, maintaining the theme of naming mahjong solitaire variants after territories in China. Chinhai has long since been renamed Zhenhai, which is situated in the Ningpo Prefecture and now part of a much larger city. This mahjong solitaire variant is perhaps best known as Sichuan or Shisenshou, also named for a province in China.</desc>

	<desc>The Cho Aniki series makes it's debut on the SNES with all of it's homo-erotic, pseudo humorous, bizarre, sweaty bodybuilding charm, but with one major gameplay change. Instead of being another side-scrolling shooter, Bakuretsu Rantouden is actually a one-on-one 2D fighter a la Street Fighter in which the most recognizable characters from the Cho Aniki series (yes the speedo wearing bodybuilders included) fight each other for ultimate supremacy using special attacks and moves.

An interesting feature is that the game honors it's shooter roots, therefore instead of being restricted to walking backwards and forwards in the 2D plane and jumping around as in other fighting games, in this game all the characters can fly meaning the fights actually occur in mid-air allowing the players to dash all over the screen. Includes single player and 2-player vs modes.

	<desc>?In this sidescrolling action-platformer, Bonk is once again trying to save his world from the evil clutches of the reptilian king, who once more is threatening the prehistoric era.  Boy, you'd think that after being defeated four times prior that he would take a hint.  This time, you also get to face his five best soldiers, who will try to stop you in your tracks.  Bonk controls rather smoothly, and he is really fun to control.  To those of you that are not familiar with the series, Bonk is a caveman who attacks his enemies with his noggin; after jumping down, from below, while swimming, and while in the air.  He can even bounce off walls with his head, skip on the water like a stone if his head is facing down, climb certain walls with his teeth, scale up waterfalls, flip in the air (so long as the attack button is repeatedly being tapped), and so forth.  As is the case with the series, you start with a regular amount of health, but if you find a translucent heart icon, you'll increase your capacity.  What's neat is how collecting the food not only scores you some points but how it also replenishes a little bit of your health, too.  This time Bonk can also run if you hold down the A button, and the X button is used if you have a special ability on you.  If you find a power-up, whether it be piece of meat, or a different icon, then you will be given a power-up ability that will be taken out the moment you're hit once (damn).  Among the power-ups are the one where the fire will be spreading if Bonk hits his head on the ground (you know, the one where he looks freaky), one where Bonk turns into a bird and gains the ability to fly, one where Bonk becomes tiny and can make platforms made out of Japanese characters, and there is one where Bonk has the ability to double-jump as a girl.  Yes, Bonk becomes a girl if he eats the pink-colored meat.  I'm dead serious.</desc>

	<name>Choujikuu Yousai Macross : Scrambled Valkyrie</name>
	<desc>The legend of the Valkyrie pilots is not yet over. Hikaru, Max, and Millia take flight to defend the earth from Zentraedi, robots, more robots, and giant space crab-bees. Now is the time to scramble Valkyrie again. 

When starting a game or continuing the player picks from either Hikaru, Max, or Millia. Each flies a custom Valkyrie with its own set weapon load-out. A Valkyrie changes its weapon and movement speed by switching between its three forms: Fighter, Gerwalk, and Battroid. Typically the Valkyrie weapon shoots straight and quickly, the Gerwalk weapon shoots around or through obstacles, and the Battroid weapon does higher damage in exchange for reduced firing rate. Each weapon can be upgraded up to twice by picking up power up items dropped by special enemy ships, but one level of power up will be lost any time the Valkyrie is shot. If a Valkyrie's entire life bar is depleted then the full stage must be repeated, provided the player still has enough continues.

In a nod to Galaga the player is able to capture some enemy craft to increase their firepower. If the player does not shoot any weapons for a few seconds a field of electricity will cover the Valkyrie. Touching some enemy ships will then cause their targeting to be shorted out and make them friendly to the player, following along and shooting or ramming onscreen enemies.

	<desc>The magic world of Wozz, populated by magicians, alchemists, and other kinds of people - including simple town and village inhabitants - was a seemingly peaceful place, until one day, a poisonous rain started turning its inhabitants into monsters. The chief wizard realizes that the demon Balaam is trying to link the world of Wozz with the world of humans. Only a human hero can stop Balaam, and the wizard's teleporting magic brings... three young humans: the Japanese girl Reona Kitazato, and two boys: the American Shot Phoenix and the Chinese Chun Chingtao. Will those youngsters be able to stop Balaam?

The game is a traditional console-style RPG similar to Breath of Fire: turn-based battles are viewed from an isometric perspective. You control all three characters as a party, but in the beginning of the game you choose one of them as the main character, and therefore will see the game from his/her perspective. In case the characters split up, you'll be able to control only the one you chose.

	<name>Cosmo Gang - The Puzzle</name>
	<desc>Cosmo Gang: The Puzzle is a puzzle game from Namco and the second game to feature their Cosmo Gang characters. The Cosmo Gang were originally attached to a group of redemption games (like pachinko or claw machines) from Namco, but would eventually star in two Arcade games: Cosmo Gang: The Video, a Galaga clone, and Cosmo Gang: The Puzzle.

This game would become the basis of Namco's more well-known puzzle game Pac-Attack, featuring Pac-Man. As with Pac-Attack, the idea is to stack up a lot of the animated face icons (members of the Cosmo Gang) in an unbroken chain and then drop a bomb (shaped like an arrow) that goes down the chain and eliminates them all at once.</desc>

The Cosmo Gang are based on a series of characters that had previously been used by Namco for a redemption game (a type of Arcade machine that dispenses award tokens for winning a rudimentary game, of which pachinko is the most popular variant) the previous year. The subtitle suggests that this is their video game debut. Originally released in the Arcades, Cosmo Gang: The Video was later ported to the Super Famicom.</desc>

	<desc>Once again the universe is at peril from invaders from beyond, but this time their target is Earth! Galivan and company don't have time to find items or level up weapons as in Galivan's previous outing; this is a no holds barred slugfest. Three characters are playable, each with varying stats but basically the same moveset. Each character has a standard straight ahead punch or kick, a sweeping kick, an uppercut, and a ranged attack that must be charged up. At the start of the game and the end of every level the player can add stat points to their character to increase their HP, defense, jump height, and strength of normal and special attacks.

A 2 player versus mode is included as well. Both players can choose from the three main characters, and the second player can additionally choose from one of the four normal enemy types.</desc>

	<name>Crayon Shin Chan</name>
	<desc>Five-year-old Shinnosuke Nohara is the epitome of noisy children: loud and inappropriate, infuriating to his parents, and hilarious to onlookers. Shin-chan is always getting in trouble with his parents and saying bizarre or offensive things to everyone he meets. Every so often, though, he'll try to do what his mom wants him to, but more often than not, he'll misunderstand and simply confound his parents further.

Arashi o Yobu Enji ("A Kindergartner Called Tempest") is one of many games based on the manga and anime created by Yoshito Usui. In four stages, each made up of five areas, Shin-chan must explore his neighborhood looking for a specific object. He can enter houses to ask people for information, but will often end up simply insulting them. He must also avoid or knock over the other children in the neighborhood, and has various ability cards that he can use to assist him, which might give him a water pistol or refill his health. After finding what he's looking for, Shin-chan will move on to the next area.

Also included is a minigame mode with eight different minigames, such as a bubble-blowing contest, a three-legged race, and a desperate search for clothing before school. The entire game, including the minigames, is filled with dialogue containing the same humor as the source material.

	<desc>Crayon Shin-Chan 2: Dai Maou no Gyakushu ("Crayon Shin-Chan 2: The Demon Lord's Counterattack") is a platformer based on the Crayon Shin-Chan anime and manga. The player, as the mischievous kindergartner Shin-chan, must rescue his favorite super hero Action Kamen ("Action Mask") from his prison before Action Kamen's supervillain nemesis Haiguremaou can take over both Action Kamen's and Shin-chan's worlds. Many of the bosses are transformed versions of Shin-chan's friends and family.

The game is a standard side-scrolling 2D platformer - common with licensed games - though it is notable for letting players decide which order they want to tackle stages, not to mention the franchise's penchant for weird/gross-out humor.</desc>

	<desc>There was once a prosperous kingdom, a peaceful kingdom, ruled by a wise old king, where all peopled lived happily together, protected by the power of a magical crystal. But one day, several dark clouds appeared over the kingdom and poured down a devastating rain. And then one of the clouds turned into a demon, and, reaching its hands to the treasure room in the palace, took the crystal away. The demon lord, still in a form of a menacing dark cloud, started spawning monsters and sending them to attack the now helpless kingdom. The king called to the heavens for help. Eight magical weapons fell on the ground, and eight warriors rose to protect their country. Your task now is to cleanse the land of the monsters and to defeat the evil demon lord.

"Crystal Beans" is an action RPG based on fighting and dungeon crawling. You can play as either of the eight initial character classes: Fighter, Warrior, Bow-man, Wizard, Priest, Kage (a kind of a ninja), Monk, or Witch. In addition, there are four secret classes you discover during your journey. Each class has its own strength and weaknesses, and two unique attack types.</desc>

	<name>Cu-On-Pa SFC</name>
	<desc>Cu-On-Pa SFC is the Super Famicom version of Cu-On-Pa.Cu-On-Pa is an original puzzle game that was developed by a little-known group called Onesong Partners. This group originally released an obscure game similar to this but with a wider audience in mind, various enhancements and alternate modes for PCs called "Endorfun" in 1995 in the U.S and Europe.Japanese developers seemed to like the concept and got permission to make something like it based on the original principals of Endorfun for the obscure Satellaview (or BS-X) and then later as a standalone release for the Super Famicom, where the game was called BS Cu-On-Pa and Cu-On-Pa, respectively. It would also get released later for Playstation.Published by T&amp;E Soft for the SFC late in 1996, Cu-On-Pa was also fan-translated sometime later for the emulation community, though the game comes with a rather straightforward tutorial and the game is very easy to understand, but difficult to master. This game is difficult to describe and in a league of its own.You play as a three-dimensional cube that must destroy all the "Life Panels" on a level. To do so, you have to rotate your cube and roll over the colored squares on the transparent field. Panels come in a variety of colors and the main way to elimate them is by having the color on the top of the cube match the color of the tile beneath you.The other way is for more skilled players and comes in the form of "Lightning Panels", which are generated when you destroy panels other than Life Panels. Destroy enough of them and you'll have lots of them. Then go and destroy a life panel! What will happen is, all lightning panels will explode that match the color of the life panel you rolled over. Moreover, the explosion spreads and detonates other tiles in the vicinity, which can spread and create a chain reaction. It's up to you how you wish to rack up points, either by time, chains, or both.Ken Kojima was the music composer.</desc>

	<name>Cyber Knight</name>
	<desc>In the 24th century, mankind has gone into space. The crew of the starship Swordfish are in an engagement with space pirates when the battle takes a turn for the worse. In desperation, the crew activate their jump drive without a destination... and end up flung across the galaxy to the galactic core. The Swordfish however is badly damaged with many casualties including the captain. Only 26 of the crew survive, and of them only 6 are qualified for combat: The commander, two soldiers, a mechanic and a doctor and six giant "Module" mechanized suits available for them. These survivors locate planet Farworld, apparently colonized by humans. There they discover the colony is under attack by a relentless mechanical aliens dubbed "Berserkers". The crew of the swordfish must fight back against the Berserkers and explore the galaxy for some means to return home.

Cyber Knight is an RPG with a science-fiction theme of being lost in an alien galaxy. The game takes place in a top-down view for movement on planets and areas, a side-view for combat sequences and a first person menu system when aboard the Swordfish starship. The Swordfish can travel between stars, scanning worlds for information. If the ship is able to land on a planet, three crew members piloting three Modules (giant robots) can be selected to debark and explore the planet. Many planets will have towns or people living on them which can be talked to in order to uncover information. Different quests are assigned in order to find the items necessary to progress. There is no system of currency or buying items. Instead, many defeated Berserkers leave behind "NeoParts", which can be brought back to the Swordfish's lab. Analysis of these Neo parts unlocks enhances statistics (endurance, agility, accuracy, etc) for the Modules and new weapons for them to carry. The six modules are unique in statistics, and also the six pilots each carry different skills.

Combat takes place in turn-based combat on a 6x6 squares field. Seen from the side view, the three modules can be positioned in relation to enemies in order to attack, using a variety of melee and long-ranged weaponry. Ammunition is unlimited, but each module also carries a number of "options" that are consumable attacks. Each Module has two sets of hitpoints: one for the pilot and one for the module itself. If either one of these reaches zero, the module is destroyed. In order to heal, the party carries 10 each of repair kits and first aid kits, which must when not in combat. These kits, as well as options and defeated pilots or modules can be restored by returning to the Swordfish.</desc>

	<desc>Following the events of the first Cyber Knight in the 24th century, the crew of the Swordfish have returned to Earth after defeating the mechanical "Berzerkers" far across space. However during their time away, the Earth Federation has been taken over by the ambitious General Forrest, who seeks to wage war on the independent systems and conquer them. Recognizing the potential weapons that could be made from the Berzerker science data, Forrest impounds the Swordfish and jails it's crew. The Berzerker data is used to create "Overtech" and bring to life "Metalliforms", self-replicating war machines. The Swordfish crew manages to escape, thanks to a mysterious agent "CJ", and are recruited into the resistance against the Earth Federation. Given a new spaceship, the Galvodirge, they must travel the galaxy to different human civilizations and devise a plan to stop Earth's attack.

Cyber Knight II is an RPG with science-fiction themes. As in the first game, much of the game takes place in a top-down view for movement on planets and areas, a side-view for combat sequences and a first person menu system when aboard the Galvodirge starship. The Galvodirge can travel between stars, scanning worlds for information. If the ship is able to land on a planet, the crew can debark either on foot or using combat modules (mechs). Some areas are only accessible using modules and others (such as towns) do not allow the use of these war machines. Many planets will have towns or people living on them which can be talked to in order to uncover information. Different quests are assigned in order to find the items necessary to progress. There is no system of currency or buying items. Instead, many defeated enemies leave behind "NeoParts", which can be brought back to the Swordfish's lab. Analysis of these Neo parts unlocks enhances statistics (endurance, agility, accuracy, etc) for the Modules and new weapons for them to carry. 

The crew are divided into a three person "combat team" and a three person "support team". If modules are used, they can be assigned from the ship's hanger. Unlike the first game, modules only perform a combat or a support role, and each is unique in statistics and the type of weaponry it can carry. When combat occurs on the main map, the support team will often deliver the first strike by firing missiles into the enemies. When searching facilities, caves or other locations, the support team is not available. Following either case, the combat team engages the enemy in turn-based combat on a 6x6 squares field. Seen from the side view, the three modules can be positioned in relation to enemies in order to attack, using a variety of melee and long-ranged weaponry. Ammunition is unlimited, but each module also carries a number of "options" that are consumable attacks. Each Module has two sets of hitpoints: one for the pilot and one for the module itself. If either one of these reaches zero, the module is destroyed. In order to heal, the party carries 10 each of repair kits and first aid kits, which must when not in combat. These kits, as well as options and defeated pilots or modules can be restored by returning to the Galvodirge.</desc>

	<desc>Nine young people were turned into cyborgs by a company trying to take over the world. They have defeated this company and are now using their super powers to protect the world.

Based on the manga/anime by the same name, Cyborg 009 is a side-scrolling platformer in which the player takes control of 8 different cyborgs, using their special abilities to complete several missions. 

Their special abilities are as follows:
002 can fly and hover in the air; 003 can see in the dark; 004 can fire bullets from his fingers and rockets from his knees; 005 can break rocks with his fists; 006 can blow fire that also melts rocks; 007 can take on different shapes including those of enemies; 008 can swim underwater for extended periods of time; 009 can move at very high speeds. (001 is a baby and can't be taken on missions). Using these special abilities consumes SP that slowly regenerate. 

In addition to their special abilities, the cyborgs also have four attributes that govern their attack and defensive powers, their amount of SP and SP regeneration speed. 

Before every mission, one cyborg is assigned leader and two more can be selected by the player. Only one cyborg can be controlled at a time, but it is possible to switch between cyborgs at any time. All cyborgs share the same HP and SP-bar. Throughout the levels, experience points can be collected and used to increase a cyborg's attributes after a completed mission.</desc>

The divine hero-god Roda went up to his dark realm to defeat him, but was struck down, and presumed dead. But the hero couldn't die so easily: he swore to defeat Rukyu once and for all. Meanwhile, Rukyu doesn't just stay in his realm, waiting for Roda: he goes out to the world as a death-bringing sorcerer, and he is out for Roda...

The game is quite different from most other RPGs, because it lets you play as both the "good" hero and the villain. The game is divided into chapters, and each chapter is played by either Roda or Rukyu. You switch the two heroes chapter-after-chapter, and lead them to their ultimate battle from two opposite sides. The entire game, including the battles, is viewed from an isometric perspective. The battles are random and turn-based, and the battle field is divided into squares you can position and move your characters on. Both Roda and Rukyu can have party members join them, and both attack mostly with magic. Rukyu uses a special energy called "Soul Power", while Roda cast one-time spells from scrolls he receives after battles.</desc>

	<name>Dark Law: The Meaning of Death</name>
	<desc>Three-hundred years ago, there were two kingdoms on the earth -Reyfore, ruled by the benevolent and mighty king Reynard, and Amugnon, ruled by king Daruk. The two kingdoms could have lived in peace, but pride took over king Daruk, he didn't respect the Goddess any more, and as a result his mind became obsessed by the idea of destruction. Daruk attacked Reyfore, and for decades war was embracing the two kingdoms, setting the Earth in flames. After a prolonged battle, king Reynard defeated king Daruk, and a reign of prosperity began once again.

But can evil be truly defeated? The hero of the game, a young adventurer, falls down from a cliff while taking a stroll near the ancient Sophia Temple. He is saved by an old man who lives with his daughter Refia in a small country house. But one day, a demonic-looking knight appears, accompanied by monsters, kills the old man, and kidnaps Refia. The old man recognized the knight - it was king Daruk! Now the hero must bring Refia back and defeat Daruk once and for all.

The game has a less linear structure than a standard console-style RPG: together with the main story there are many missions, or "scenarios", which are not obligatory to complete, but which occupy a large portion of the game. In the beginning of the game you create a party of four characters, the hero and his three companions. The battles are pre-determined and take place on the same screen as the gameworld itself. Your party and the enemies can move freely around the screen and attack with melee and ranged weapons, and their actions depend on the amount of action points they have. Navigation in town is menu-based.</desc>

	<desc>Dear Boys is a 1994 Super Famicom basketball game based on the manga of the same name. The game features both a story mode, which follows the plot of the manga, and an exhibition mode that allows the player to go straight into a match.

The game features a "dramatic" perspective that is also slightly turn-based, similar to the Captain Tsubasa games. A window demonstrates what is happening - a ball is passed, a shot is thrown, the tip-off - in dramatic comic book style that is reminiscent of the manga. While a player's athlete has the ball, the player can pull up a menu that allows them to choose to pass, shoot or look at the present characters stats - each character has their own strengths and weaknesses that the player should keep in mind.</desc>

	<name>Dharma Doujou</name>
	<desc>Dharma Doujou was originally released in the arcades by Metro3D in 1994 (picture on the left). While the original version provides the same gameplay as the Super Famicom version tested here, the game does have some noticeable differences. First of all, it has more enemies and features colorful backgrounds borrowed from traditional Japanese themes and myths (well, in the Korean version of the game, Metro3D apparently threw in a couple of bikini girls for good measure). Additionally, the arcade game only contains a story mode and there is no progress map or alternate game modes like in the Super Famicom port. But, most importantly, the gameplay is slightly different - the player has to move the character around the screen in order to hit a block with the mallet. The Super Famicon version, on the contrary, automatically aligns the player with the furthest most block, and this apparently minor difference makes the gameplay of the home conversion more fast-paced and enjoyable than the original.</desc>

	<name>Doraemon</name>
	<desc>The game is based on the animé series "Doraemon". Doraemon is a blue robotic cat who has the ability to enter dream world and to help the people who live there. In this game, Nobita, a bespectacled friend of Doraemon's, suddenly meets a little fairy. Long ago, humans and fairies lived together in peace, but since the humans started developing their technology, the fairies have no place any more. Nobita and Doraemon travel to the dream world to find out how can they help.

The game is divided into adventure and platform action modes. In adventure mode, you navigate Doraemon from a top-down view, talking to people and entering houses. When you have gathered enough information, a place on the map will be highlighted. If Doraemon (or other characters, later in the game) enters this place, a platform action section begins. In platform mode, Doraemon must overcome the obstacles and defeat enemies by jumping on them or by throwing magic dusk at them, in order to retrieve important items.

	<desc>The game is closely related to Doraemon: Nobita to Yosei no Kuni. It is based on the manga "Doraemon", that tells the story of a Japanese boy named Nobita, who always gets bullied by stronger kids in the school. In the future, his grandson uses a time machine and send the cat-like robot Doraemon to protect Nobita. In this adventure, Nobita, Doraemon, and their friends travel to the Toys Land. Some evil toys are threatening this country, and it's up to our heroes to help its inhabitants.

The game is divided into adventure and platform action modes. In adventure mode, Doraemon walks around towns, talking to people and entering houses. Key locations lead to platform levels, which must be completed to advance the story. Platform levels include plenty of obstacles (pits, spikes, self-destructing platforms etc.), as well as various enemies who try to stop the heroes. You can choose one of the six available characters to play through the platform level. They all can jump and defeat enemies either by jumping on their heads or by using long-ranged weapons.

Nobita's future grandson constructs a cat-like blue robot named Doraemon, and sends him to the past to protect Nobita. In this game, a friend of Nobita's finds a fossil. Accidentally, this fossil gets overrun by a car. Nobita feels it was his fault and asks Doraemon to use a time machine to travel back to prehistoric age to retrieve the fossil. 

This is an action platform game with adventure elements. You can control Doraemon, Nobita, and other characters, traveling through platform levels, defeating or avoiding enemies. Each character has his own weapon and possesses a special ability (for example, Suneo can crawl through narrow spaces, etc.) which is often required to complete a stage. In present time, you travel through Nobita's town in top down view, talking to characters and entering houses. There is also a slight RPG element in the game, as you can buy items and upgrade your weapons.

	<desc>A young boy named Milon sets off to save Alis, his fairy friend, after she was captured by the evil sorcerer Amon. He later learns that the only way to defeat Amon is by collecting five legendary instruments which Amon has stolen.  The sorcerer placed a curse on these instruments so that their true powers cannot be used and then left them in the hands of his minions.  The only way to lift the curse is by collecting five stars.

Armed with only his bubble shooter, Milon must retrieve the legendary instruments, lift their curses and use their powers to defeat Amon and rescue Alis.

Traveling through many different worlds starting with the forest, Milon will be confronted by many enemies. Milon can either shoot bubbles to trap and send his enemies away, or he can jump and flatten his enemies temporarily turning them into a platform for him to walk across. 

Milon has three different "outfits": red, blue, and green. With the green outfit, Milon can withstand three hits. Each time he gets hit, he will be downgraded a color - green to blue, blue to red. If he gets hit with the red outfit, he will die and have to start the level over.

By collecting 100 music notes, Milon will get an extra life. There are also other useful items to get like bubble gum that will save Milon once if he were to fall, a special bubble shooter that let's him shoot multiple bubbles at once and a star that makes Milon temporarily invincible so that he can defeat enemies simply by running at them.</desc>

	<name>Dossun ! Ganseki Battle</name>
	<desc>A falling block puzzle game  in a pseudo-medieval fantasy setting that pits two characters against each other in an abstract form of combat that is quite similar to games like Columns. Combining at least three matching symbols in a vertical, horizontal or diagonal line does not only clear them off the screen, but also deals damage to an opponent. This means that players do not only have to keep their game area clear, but also pay attention to their characters health bar. Once a block touches the top of the screen or the health bar is diminished the game ends.

There are four different icons that have different effects when combined:
Books, swords and rocks deal damage to an opponent by attacking with fireballs, dragons or swords.
Bottles heal a certain amount of health.
Purple blocks have no effect, but clog up the screen nonetheless.

Chain reactions result in particularly powerful attacks or place one or more grey blocks inside the opponents area. They can be destroyed just like ordinary blocks, but they always stay in the same spot and do not fall down.

More complex chain reactions give access to special attacks, up to three of which can be held and activated with the shoulder buttons. Special attacks have different effects that include clearing all purple blocks, using all potions and clearing the bottom three lines.

As expected of a Nekketsu game you can play it rough by sneaking punches and kicks to "bend" the rules a bit, you can also use the "ki" or willpower of your players to trigger special moves and strategic management is limited to specifying different base strategies and behaviors for each player.</desc>

The game picks up the story where it ended in the previous game, and continues through Piccolo, Saiyajin, and Freezer sagas of the manga. After the battle with the Demon King (Daimaou) Piccolo, the twenty-third World Martial Arts Tournament is about to begin. But to the amazement of the hero Son Goku and his friends, their archrival Piccolo appears during the tournament, so that it quickly turns into a genuine battle.

You control Son Goku and his son Son Gohan, switching between them as the game progresses. The game is basically an interactive comic book in which you can influence the story by choosing to press a button when the game prompts you to make a choice. You'll also participate in battles. The battle system is similar to rock-paper-scissors game, where one kind of move always beats or always loses to another. You can dash into your enemies, attack physically, and perform special moves, pressing the buttons in real time (although the battles are divided into turns).

	<name>Dragon Ball Z : Legend of the Super Saiyan</name>
	<desc>Cho Saiya Densetsu is based on the popular manga/animé series Dragon Ball. It follows the events described in the beginning of Dragon Ball Z, the second story block, which tells about the connection of the hero Son Goku with a powerful alien race, and new mighty foes from far away planets. The game starts just where the tale of Dragon Ball begins. Son Goku goes to meet his friends, but is stopped by a mysterious stranger named Raditz who tells Son Goku they are relatives. Raditz demands from him to destroy humanity, and as Son Goku refuses, takes his son Son Gohan hostage. To rescue his son, Son Goku joins forces with his arch-rival, the Demon King Piccolo, who obviously has his own plans concerning Raditz. And thus begins the story during which Son Goku will learn of his true origin...

The game is a RPG similar to the card-based Dragon Ball Z RPGs for NES. During battles, you choose cards from your card inventory, which determine the nature and the strength of your characters' attacks. You can also train your characters in training houses and upgrade their special Ki power. Unlike early DBZ RPGs, you can move around freely in Cho Saiya Densetsu, and your movements are not determined by cards. You can also fly around the world and use your special Dragon Radar to discover location of magical Dragon Balls.

	<name>Dragon Quest I.II</name>
	<desc>This is a remake of two classic NES RPGs - an exclusively Japanese release of the two first Dragon Quest titles on one cartridge.

In Dragon Quest (known as Dragon Warrior in the US), you play as the descendant of the legendary warrior Erdrick, and your goal is to recover the magical Ball of Light from Erdrick's and the humanity's arch-enemy, the Dragon Lord. In Dragon Quest II, you assume the role of the descendant of the hero of the first game, and must join forces with two other characters in order to defeat a demon lord who destroyed a nearby city and killed its inhabitants. 

Both RPGs feature random battles and turn-based combat viewed from first-person perspective. In Dragon Quest you fight alone, while in the sequel two other characters can join your party, and you also fight against multiple enemies at once.

The remake includes updated graphics (although they still retain the original NES look), sound of SNES quality, and some changes in the gameplay and in the game world. Certain locations are larger, some menu commands (such as "Stairs") are omitted, and there is a larger variety of items.

	<name>Dragon Quest III</name>
	<desc>Dragon Warrior III is the concluding game of the first Dragon Quest/Dragon Warrior trilogy, and its story takes us back to the time period of the legendary Erdrick (also known as Loto), the ancestor of the first game's hero. You are the son of a powerful warrior Ortega, skillful in physical combat and spellcasting. Your father went out to fight the evil Baramos, who is responsible for the appearance of monsters in your region, and never returned. You are sent by the king on a quest to continue your father's brave deeds and to defeat Baramos.

Dragon Warrior III is a top-down role-playing game where you travel around the overworld, caves, castles, cities and other locations while battling random encounters, buying equipment, and talking to people. You and your party members receive experience when they beat up monsters and level up with enough experience, increasing their stats. The game features a day/night cycle - as you travel, day slowly changes to night and vice versa; shops are typically closed at night. 

You begin with control of just the main character but can quickly recruit three more members to your party. During the game you can choose to drop your current characters and recruit others at any time. The recruitable characters are divided into six classes: soldier, fighter, merchant, goof-off, pilgrim and wizard.

The game has a unique job system, giving you the ability to switch your hired characters' classes after they have achieved at least level 20 in their base class. Characters can switch to the other beginning classes, as well as the sage class, which is not available at the beginning. When a character switches classes, they lose all earned experience points, and half of their stats, but retain all of the abilities of the previous class. In this way, you can create powerful combination characters that are able to cast spells and fight effectively.

	<name>Dragon Quest V</name>
	<desc>You are the son of the brave warrior, Lord Papas. It appears that your mother died just after giving birth to you, and your father took you on a long journey when you were a little baby, and all you know is that he was searching for something. Now you are six years old, and Lord Papas brings you to your home village. After some time, you learn that His Highness Prince Henry was kidnapped by bandits. Your father attempts to rescue him, and during this action you discover that perhaps your mother is still alive... The game follows the story of Papas' son, and this story is stretched over years, as the hero grows and becomes a man of courage and virtue. During the game, the hero will discover the truth about his mother, and will have to make some crucial decisions, such as which girl to marry (the decisions affect the course of the game and its ending).

"Dragon Quest V" is a party RPG with turn-based combat, and battles viewed from 1st person perspective, just like all its predecessors. Your party roams about the world, fighting random enemies, performing quests, and defeating bosses. The novelty is in the game's unusual story, which spans almost a lifetime of the hero. 

"Dragon Quest V" was not available outside of Japan until 2009, when the DS version was released in the United States.

Was this just a dream? You have just fallen out of your bed dreaming! It's time to go to the village elder, to get a seemingly simple assignment - to sell some goods at a bazaar in the nearest town. But soon the hero will discover his dream was not so far away from reality...

"Dragon Quest VI" is the last SNES game of the Dragon Quest series (called "Dragon Warrior" in US). It is a party RPG with turn-based combat and battles viewed from 1st person perspective. Not much has changed since the NES days of Dragon Quest - gameplay style, setting, and even menu layout seem almost identical to those of the early classics. Like its immediate predecessor Dragon Quest V, this game was never released outside Japan.

	<desc>Long time ago, a flourishing civilization was destroyed by the rage of a mighty dragon. The Earth was set in flames, and no one escaped the destruction - no one except one man, who managed to launch himself forward, thousand years into the future. There, he was found by people of Kardosa Empire, who soon understood they have in their hands a human who possesses the secret of a superior ancient technology, that was unknown to the primitive civilization of the present...

You play the role of Aleth, the son of the High Priest in the small kingdom of Garade, whom leads a peaceful life with his friend Lagnus, Prince of Garade. One day Aleth accidentally gains possession of a precious artifact which is sought after by the Kardosa Empire. Aleth and Lagnus get involve in a conflict which will soon lead them to great discoveries of the secrets of the ancient civilization, of the great destruction that occurred thousand years ago, and of their own true identities...

The game is a console-style RPG: your party meets randomly encountered enemies and bosses, and fights them in turn-based combat viewed from isometric perspective. You upgrade armor by buying it, and also can buy weapons, but weapons can also be upgraded for money to different levels, to create powerful attacks called "techs".</desc>

	<desc>Dynamic Stadium is a baseball game from Eleca/Electronics Application released exclusively for the Super Famicom. While adopting the same behind-the-batter perspective as Namco's Famista series, Dynamic Stadium presents its athletes as comic book heroes rather than chibi figures, making them absurdly buff and frequently featuring action shots of them catching fly-balls and narrowly making it to base before being caught out. "Safe!" and "Out!" calls are presented as spiky word balloons.

Dynamic Stadium does not feature an official NPB license, so all the team names are fictitious. The game was published in Japan by Sammy Corporation and was never localized for overseas territories.</desc>

In Edo no Kiba you are always moving forward, either running or walking (or, in some levels, flying), although you can still move around the screen as in most belt-scrolling games. Your avatar attacks by slashing to the right with his energy sword, and he can also hold his sword defensively to deflect some bullets. By then holding forward and releasing attack he can throw the sword like a boomerang. He can also jump. A bomb follows the avatar around on any on-foot level that can be used to destroy all enemies onscreen at any time, and it will be replaced whenever a life is lost. Environments range from city streets to sewers and a flying battleship. Each level ends with a boss fight against an enemy that can withstand many attacks.</desc>

	<desc>In "Emerald Dragon", you play as Atrushan, a blue dragon who lives in the Dragon World. One day, he and his friends discover a ship wreck near a mountain. After examining the wreck, the dragons find a human child - a little girl. The wise White Dragon, the leader of the dragons, tells them that her name is Tamryn and that she will play an important role in their lives. The girl doesn't remember anything, and grows up together with the dragons. But when she turns fifteen, she decides to go back to her homeland - the Human World. Soon after Tamryn has left, Atrushan realizes he can't bear the separation, and asks the White Dragon to allow him to go and find Tamryn in the Human World. But a mysterious evil curse has been placed on the dragons - they can't appear among the humans in their true form. Atrushan agrees to become a human and goes to the Human World - to find Tamryn, and also a way to remove the curse...

The game features traditional Japanese-style RPG gameplay - Atrushan and his party travel over world map, visiting towns and descending into dungeons. The battle system is somewhat unusual - you can control only Atrushan, while other party members are controlled by the AI. You have a special bar for your actions in battle: once it is depleted, you can't perform any action and must wait for your next turn. You can move freely over the battle field, position yourself strategically near or far away from the enemy, attack from different sides, and assign general strategies to your non-controllable party members.</desc>

	<name>FEDA: The Emblem of Justice</name>
	<desc>In a fantasy world, a soldier from the imperial forces deserts after witnessing the massacre of innocent villagers by his unit. He is sent to jail to be executed, but manages to escape with the help of two former unit colleagues. The group flees through the country-side, while being pursued by imperial soldiers. On their way, they join forces with other rebels to fight against the enemy, while uncovering hidden secrets and evil plots by the Empire.

FEDA: Emblem of Justice is a strategy RPG similar to Shining Force and other titles with preset characters and linear gameplay. The player commands a party of varying size and characters with diverse skills.

In the main battle sections, the player and the CPU-controlled enemy take turns moving the troops and giving orders. A menu at the bottom of the screen shows all the possible actions, where soldiers can defend, move, attack, or use an inventory item on each turn. The range of their movements and weapons vary according to their nature. A crossbow character can shoot from the back, while most sword and knife users have to be adjacent to their targets. Magic offensive powers have different ranges as well, reaching enemies that are far away from the attacking character. Health points can be recovered by eating rations or by magic, where a healer can restore points to several characters at once.

Each party member has separate health and magic points, as well as other statistics like defense and attack power. They receive experience points after slaying an enemy or casting a spell, and extra points at the end of the battle. Their skills increase after surpassing 100 points.

The map screen shows the party and groups of enemies traveling through the landscape in turns. The menu has options for moving the group or camping. In the encampment, one of the characters around the fire pit saves the game, while another inside the tent provides system options to change the interface color, adjust sound volume and rename the party members.

In some locations like temples, villages and towns, the party has to explore the place and talk to the citizens to move on to the next section. In later battles, the player has to make a moral choice about attacking mutated humans. At the end of each battle, the party is assigned a dark or light emblem, and certain party members choose to leave or stay in the group based on its alignment.</desc>

	<name>Final Fantasy II</name>
	<desc>This is the fourth entry in the  Final Fantasy series. It was known as Final Fantasy II internationally, because the  second and third games were never released outside of Japan.

The military country of Baron is one of the strongest in the land, with a proud army and a majestic air force known as the Red Wings. But, while their armies are kind and loyal, the recent actions of the King are anything but. The young Captain of the Red Wings, Cecil, is ordered to steal a crystal from a village of innocent magicians, and when he questions the actions of his King, Cecil is immediately thrown out of the country and sent off to kill strange monsters. Little does he realize the price the King's actions will pay, and what the true secret of the crystals, and their powers, truly is...

This is the first Final Fantasy game that introduced the famous ATB (active-time battle) system: during the battles, you have a time indicator for each party member that tells you when this character is able to act. If it takes you too long to select a command for this character, the enemy will act without waiting for your turn. The game abandons the job system that was implemented in the first and the third game in favor of pre-set character classes (paladin, white mage, ninja, etc.) assigned to each party member.

The PlayStation version adds a new rendered intro and ending.</desc>

	<name>Final Fantasy V</name>
	<desc>The Elemental Crystals...the life source of the planet. With them, gentle winds blow, the seas are active, fire burns bright, and the earth is full of life. All seems well in the world, until the wind suddenly stops, the sea begin to grow stagnant, the heat of fire becomes scarce, and the earth begins to wither. King Tycoon, sensing a premonition of evil, hurries off to check on the Wind Crystal, only to witness it destroy itself.

Meanwhile, a young traveler named Butz is camping in a field when a giant meteor strikes the planet. When he heads out to examine the meteor, he is shocked to find a young girl named Lenna, who is the princess of Tycoon, and a old man named Galuf, who is on a critical mission. Later, joined by Faris, a pirate captain, the foursome must travel the land in search of the destructor of the Crystals, and save the planet at any cost!

Final Fantasy V featured many new gameplay options and tactics, including an improved Job/Ability system (like in Final Fantasy Tactics), the return of the ATB (Active Time Battle) turn system, and all of the classic FF gameplay you've come to know and love!

Final Fantasy V was released as a stand-alone game in Japan, and again in Final Fantasy Collection. Its U.S. debut was as part of Final Fantasy Anthology. It was also later ported to the Gameboy Advance, adding 4 new Jobs, a new 30-floor dungeon, a bestiary, a music player, the ability to quick save anywhere, a few extra pieces of equipment, and a newly update translation.</desc>

	<name>Final Fantasy III</name>
	<desc>This is the sixth entry in the  Final Fantasy series. It was called Final Fantasy III because three of the five previous installments of the series were never released outside of Japan.

1,000 years ago, the War of the Magi occurred. People remember it as one of the most horrible tragedies in history. Since the War of the Magi, magic has been all but forgotten, technology began to grow, and people returned to seemingly normal lives. The only true worry people had was the Empire, whose leaders were looking to revive the great force once known as "magic".

But then...something happened that would change the course of history forever...

The Empire had heard word of the remains of a mystical being, known as an "Esper", being found in the mining town of Narshe. Quickly, three soldiers were dispatched to find this Esper and bring it to the Emperor. One of the soldiers, a young girl, triggers a power in the Esper that will begin one of the most dangerous series of events ever. And the only ones who can help her are a rag-tag band of rebels and heroes, whose very hearts and souls are the only ones that can save the world from the mad plans of the Empire.

The game maintains the ATB (active time battle) system of the two previous Final Fantasy games, spicing classic turn-based combat engine with a real-time element. The customization system combines character-specific classes with free-flowing character development. By finding various Espers and equipping them on characters, you can improve their parameters in different ways and choose the magic spells you want to learn for each character.</desc>

	<desc>A remake and expansion of the first NES/Famicom Fire Emblem, Marth must face the betrayal if Hardin and an old enemy he thought long vanquished, the Dragon King Medeus.

Book 1 of the game is essentially a remake of the first NES game. Book 2 continues the story with the same characters.

This game expands the series, however it drops explorable towns and the navigation through a world map which was introduced in Fire Emblem: Gaiden. New features include the ability to dismount the horse and pegasus mounted units, to allow the riders to fight indoors if needed.

At its most simple the story is of Prince Leaf of Lenster's struggle to free his native land from two forces, the Grandbell Empire and the Loptus religion.

Features introduced into this part of the series include fog of war and night maps with limited vision, this requires characters to use torches and wands to light their way. Also the capture command which allowed enemies to be subdued and their weapons taken.

	<name>From TV animation - Slam Dunk SD Heat Up!!</name>
	<desc>Among the most famous Japanese comics of the 90s are definitely Slam Dunk. The manga tells of the running track that will make the young hoodlum Hanamichi Sakuragi who joined the basketball club in Shohoku high school just because initially interested in the sister of the captain Akagi but later this sport will conquer him so much that he becomes a real basketman.

The game is essentially an arcade sports title basketball basically. The main screen there will be little choice given the presence of only three modes: Story mode and classic friendly tournament. In the first we follow the events of the television series whose plot differs slightly from the original one: using Shohoku then we will qualify for the national championship. The second and third but I think there is a need for further explanation.

Executable field operations would also be different, you can also feint shots and blow up their opponents markers. Then successfully accumulating a sequence of 'affirmative action' row (steps succeeded, baskets made or avoided), will fill a horizontal bar at the top of the screen and, as he did a little 'in the playroom with the SNK Street Hoop, pressing simultaneously the three keys will not dorsal (except B), you can make a super nice shooting with supplemental animations depending on the player used.

	<path>./Front Mission (Japan) [T-En by FH v1.0b].bin</path>
	<name>Front Mission</name>
	<desc>In the future, many military forces are dependent on huge mech robots, called Wanzers (Walking Panzers) for combat. At Huffman Island, located in the the pacific ocean, wanzers are deployed by both the USN (United States of the New Continent) and the OCU (Oceana Community Union), who dispute ownership over the island.  One night, the OCU forces stage a covert recon mission on a facility located in Larcus, a USN-held territory and weapons facility. Lead by a soldier named Roid, this mission was entirely unofficial and violated the peace treaty. During the mission, USN forces lead by Commander Driscoll appeared and ambushed the OCU soldiers. During the combat, Roid's fiance, Karen is killed and the USN facility is blown up; placing the blame on the OCU. This became known as the &amp;quot;Larcus Incident&amp;quot; and the OCU denied all knowledge of it's soldiers actions. Ultimately it would be a leading cause to the second Huffman War. 

One year later, the war is underway and Huffman island is under provisional control of the OCU, but with a weakened military unable to defend against USN attacks. The soldiers involved involved in the Larcus Incident have all been discharged and disgraced. Roid spends his time fighting as a gladiator in the Wanzer fighting arena before being approached by a mysterious man. Colonel Olson has found out about Roid's history and wants him to command a mercenary unit he is assembling on behalf of the OCU, dubbed &amp;quot;Carrion Crow&amp;quot;. Convincing Roid that Driscoll is still out there on the island, Roid agrees.

Front Mission is a turn-based strategy RPG played from an isometric perspective. Players progress in the story through large strategic battles involving multiple units and cutscenes between them. At certain places, usually towns, the player can visit multiple locations including bars and shops, and talk to people. Shops are also found to purchase new weaponry, parts and make repairs. In combat, each Wanzer robot is a seperate unit and, has a large variety of weapons and attack styles depending on what's equipped. Units get experience for defeating enemies and also for using various techniques. The more an attack is used, the more powerful it becomes.</desc>

	<path>./Front Mission Series - Gun Hazard (Japan) [T-En by Aeon Genesis v1.01].bin</path>
	<name>Front Mission - Gun Hazard</name>
	<desc>The year is 2064, when the great solar power satellite, ATLAS is overshadowed by the invention of fusion power. The government alliance that had supported the building of ATLAS now find themselves facing economic crisis as the balance of power shifts. In this world of conflict and change, the Walking Panzer, or Wanzer, (a form of mecha) becomes the standard armored unit for wars and petty battles across the globe. For the small nation of Bergen, a coup d'etat is underway, staged by Colonel Ark. Seeking to establish complete control over the government and the NORAD units stationed there, Ark's first step involves the capture of President Orwen. Tipped off to the rebellion, Orwen seeks to flee from Bergen, looking for safe passage out of the seaport of Port Ertothal. A young Wanzer pilot, Albert Grabner, is assigned escort duty to the president by loyal elements of the army stationed there...

Gun Hazard is a side-scrolling version of the Front Mission series. Gameplay is more than a little similar to Cybernator or Metal Warriors. The player moves between different stages on an area map. Once inside a level, the player controls Albert and his wanzer as it moves left, right across the screen. The wanzer is able to jump, and attack with a primary and a special weapon. At any time during a level, Albert can eject from his heavily armed wanzer to explore. Although vulnerable when outside, Albert is able to reach areas the wanzer cannot, in addition to being a smaller target and being able to jetpack indefinitely.

Additionally, Albert can recruit other characters through the normal course of the story, some of whom can be designated to support roles. These support characters when set can provide a variety of different cover fire abilities for Albert during his missions. They too gain experience and levels. Different weapons and armor can be found or bought. Essential components include the Booster ability which allows the wanzer to hover and increase it's jumps, as well as the Dash ability which allows quick left-right movement by the wanzer. Money and experience are earned through the completion of level objectives as well as the kill count of enemy wanzers.</desc>

	<desc>The legend of the Golden Condor... from village to village and  from town to town, everybody speak of it - somewhere, beyond forests and mountains, there lies an idyllic Golden Land, the land of eternal happiness. Many adventurers have tried to find their way to the mysterious land of the Golden Condor, but how many of them have survived the impassable mountain paths, the dark forests and caves, and the vicious monsters? You are the wanderer Shiren, and the goal of your life is to find the Golden Land. Together with your best buddy Koppa, a talking weasel, you decide to venture deep into the dungeons that lead to the land, and to try your luck there.

Furai no Shiren (The Wanderer Shiren) is a roguelike, hack-and-slash game with randomly generated dungeon areas, items, and monsters. Despite being named Fushigi no Dungeon 2 it has no relation to the storyline or characters of the first game in the series, it does however share the same style of gameplay. The movement is turn-based. You visit towns and villages where you can buy and sell supplies. The dungeons are full of various traps and monsters, and sometimes non-playable characters you can talk to, some of which can join you on your quest.

Once launched it can be moved left and right and can be sped up by using the boost to speed it's way out of trouble. Points scored depend on the location of the hit on the enemy spacecraft. The speed at which enemy spacecraft move increases as the number of them decreases. Once all spacecraft have been destroyed, another wave starts, the speed decreases again and the process repeats. A life is lost when a missile is hit by a shot or collides with an asteroid.

Three game modes are available, B&amp;W and Color recreate the graphics and behaviour of the original arcade game in black &amp; white and color respectively whilst Neo mode updates the game with improved graphics and slightly different behaviour. There's also a turn-based two player mode. Other options include changing the number of lives available at the start of a game and the number of points needed for an extra ship.</desc>

	<name>Ganbare Goemon 2</name>
	<desc>As you may have guessed from the number 2 in the title, this is the second SNES game in the popular blend of the adventure and jump and run genres which is the Goemon series. Again, you (and your partner, in 2 player mode) control Goemon, his friend Ebisu-Maru and, new to the bunch, robot Sasuke, through loads of action stages and villages. Another new feature comes with 3D boss fights, featuring the giant mech type robot called "Goemon Impact".

	<path>./Ganbare Goemon 3 - Shishi Juurokubee no Karakuri Manjigatame (Japan).bin</path>
	<name>Ganbare Goemon 3</name>
	<desc>Third title in the Ganbare Goemon series of platform/adventure games which cast you as the heroic Goemon as he attempts to save feudal Japan from all sorts of wacky evildoers. This time around, a time-travelling machine threatens all of Japan and thus Goemon and co. must jump into the future to stop the machine.

The game alternates between a top-down world map view in which your characters explore the gameworld and side-scrolling stages in which the main action lies. As in most games of the series there are also loads of mini-games and unique gameplay sequences such as maneuvering Goemon's giant mecha.

The game continues the tradition of bizarre humor unique to the series, you can play as either Goemon or any of his 3 companions, Ebisumaru, Sasuke or Yae with each sporting unique weapons and abilities and also with their own dialogue options and cutscenes, which feature sitcom-like pre-recorded laughs for added wackiness.

	<desc>Fourth title in the Ganbare Goemon series of platform/adventure games which cast you as the heroic Goemon and his gang of wacky adventurers as he fights evil all over Japan. This sequel however, takes the action to outer space as the gang attempts to rescue Goemon Impact (Goemon's giant mecha) from a strange planet.

The game is based around a stage-select hub from which you select which character you want to play as and then attempt to clear the game's many side scrolling stages in standard action platformer fashion, navigating the obstacles and defeating all enemies you run into with your weapons. Since each one of Goemon's allies got stranded on a different planet, you must take control of each one of them in order to clear the stages and recover the special ability unique to each character that must be later put to use to release Goemon Impact. As in other games of the series there are also loads of mini-games and unique gameplay sequences triggered in boss fights, bonus stages and special situations. These involve shooter sequences, racing &amp; sport games and other assorted diversions.</desc>

In Ganbare Daiku no Gensan, you must go through five stages (with two areas each), destroying workers that get in your way using your mallet. You can use it to perform two special attacks. One that sends fireballs going in all directions, and a more powerful one that sends shockwaves, destroying everything on screen.

	<path>./Ganpuru - Gunman's Proof (Japan) (Translated En).bin</path>
	<name>Gunple: Gunman's Proof</name>
	<desc>The year is 1880. Two meteors fell on Earth on a small island near North American Pacific Coast. In the middle of the island there is a small town governed by a sheriff. At first, the town's inhabitants didn't pay attention to the meteors. But then, strange things started happening. Monsters attacked people, and left on the victims' bodies a mysterious crest with one word: demiseed. One day you, a young boy who lives in the town, are contacted by two aliens who came in a miniature space ship. One of the aliens introduces himself as Zero, the Space Sheriff, and explains that an intergalactic criminal named Demi has escaped from justice and is hiding somewhere on the island, being the cause of all the troubles lately. Zero then possesses your body, lends you his powers, and commands you on the quest to destroy Demi and to bring peace to your island and to the alien world alike!

The game is an action/adventure with slight RPG elements (buying and upgrading weapons, etc.) set in Wild West. While featuring traditional dungeon-crawling and many enemies to dispose of in real time combat, the game doesn't equip you with standard medieval swords, but with pistols, shotgun, machine gun, and even a flamethrower. Your weapons have infinite ammo. You can duck to avoid the alien monsters' fire, and perform special attacks with various types of weapons.</desc>

	<desc>One year ago they took from you your wife. Now it's time to pay them back, with interest.

Gekitotsu Dangan Jidousha Kessen: Battle Mobile plays similarly to Spyhunter in both perspective and objective, but your car in Battle Mobile isn't quite as high tech an instrument as that other game's vehicle. You can launch unlimited missiles, but they can only hit helicopters. For ground based targets you must dash into them to ram them off the road. Your car's health is constantly dwindling, even when you're not being attacked by enemies, so picking up the occasionally appearing energy refill items is essential. Shields can be picked up and stored that will make your car invulnerable to all damage for a short while.</desc>

	<name>Genocide 2</name>
	<desc>The world is still recovering from war. The mega-corporation CONEX has been spearheading the rebuilding process, but their true intentions are far from altruistic. By gobbling up their competition, and with the help of new weapons technology, CONEX is on the cusp of controlling the world. Only a hero from the last war can defy them and stop their plans of conquest.

Genocide 2 is a modified version of the PC release. The player takes control of a ten meter tall robotic ninja: the Tracer. Its only form of attack is a sword, but it can hold several extra weapons, and always has access to the Betty. The Betty can be fired in eight directions, returns to the Tracer after being fired, and can block enemy bullets. The objective of each stage is to reach the end, and some stages require you to destroy targets along the way. Any items picked up by the player, or damage done to the Tracer, carries over between stages, and each stage records your fastest time for beating them.

Aside from the visual downgrade, Genocide 2 also lost many minor enemy types and one mid-boss in the transition to the Super Famicom. The first stage was removed, and the first two levels of stage 2 were reversed. The Betty now can only be used for a limited time, and must recharge when its time has run out.</desc>

	<desc>Ghost Chaser Densei doesn't take any dramatic departures from the standard scrolling-brawler plot-line. A city twenty minutes in the future must be saved from a terrorist organization, and between salvation and you is a long, straight line full of goons who must be punched. Aside from receiving orders from your boss before each level, and the quick conversation with a boss or rare NPC, the story won't attempt to get in the way of beat-downs.

There are three playable characters in Ghost Chaser Densei: the martial artist Makai, the mace wielding cat-girl Iyo, and the autonomous robot Belva. Each has unique moves as well as the basic abilities of attacking, jumping, blocking, throwing, and using a special if attack and jump are pressed together. Unlike most brawlers these special moves deplete a recharging special bar, not your health. Makai can throw fireballs and do a flying kick in midair, Iyo can triangle jump and preform a spinning piledriver, and Belva can double jump and preform a grapple special. Characters also have a team up special if playing in two player mode. Enemies range from armored soldiers to lizard men to robots, but most break down into the same hierarchy: weaker types will rush at you while stronger types will shoot projectiles then rush at you. Each level ends with a unique boss with multiple short and long range attacks.</desc>

	<desc>Ackman is not what one would call a good person. His job is to murder and steal souls for the Demon Lord. The angel Tenshi has taken it upon himself to put an end to Ackman's nefarious ways, and sends an army of angels and hired assassins to take out Ackman for good. It's just as well, because Ackman was getting bored without anyone to kill.

Go Go Ackman is a scrolling platformer starring the titular Ackman. Ackman can punch and charge up a ranged wave of energy, and he can also jump on some enemies to stun them before running into them and turning them into a sliding projectile. Ackman can hold up to three bombs that can clear the screen of enemies, and can also hold a weapon, either a sword, boomerang, or pistol, but it will be lost if Ackman is hit. Levels are linear, but do allow some exploration to find weapons and items hidden off the beaten road.</desc>

The angel Tenshi is still determined to end Ackman's nefarious ways, and this time he has enlisted the help of the angelic rock band Metal Angel. Ackman still murders at whim and has his companion Godon collect the souls of his slain, but this time Ackman can keep the weapons he finds, either sword, boomerang, or gun. Each weapon can be upgraded twice, but upgrades will be lost if Ackman is hit or finds a new weapon. Ackman can also now throw smaller enemies, although he can't move while holding them.

Who's really pulling the strings here? And, most importantly, does Ackman care about any of this at all?

The last of the Ackman games, Go Go Ackman 3 makes very few changes from Go Go Ackman 2, although Tenshi is now a playable character. Both Ackman and Tenshi can be switched between at special points in a level, but they share the same health meter and weapon. Unlike Ackman Tenshi can fly, but as he is an angel he can not collect the souls of enemies he kills. Souls have changed too, and are now used as currency in shops where Ackman can buy temporary powerups or healing. Finally Ackman has lost the ability to slide enemies along the ground, but he can now move while holding a stunned enemy.</desc>

	<path>./Gokujou Parodius (Japan).bin</path>
	<name>Gokujou Parodius</name>
	<desc>Konami's Gradius and space-shooter parody series continues with this second installment.  Gameplay is similar to the Gradius series in that you control a ship that can move anywhere on the screen while the screen itself scrolls from left to right. Enemies appear in waves and destroying all the fighters in a single wave releases power-ups which may be used to choose your ships upgrade. The Upgrade bar too is lifted from Gradius, however each character has different names and functions for their upgrades.

In Gokujyou Parodius, you are now able to now choose from 11 different characters... many of whom appear from other Konami games. They include:

1. Vic Viper: a ship from Gradius

2. Takosuke: the "octopus" of the previous Parodius game, and also seen in at least one Goemon

3. Twinbee: making his appearance from the Twinbee side scrolling games, Twinbee is a squat round robot with a jetpack and a disproportionately big punching glove

4. Pentaro: the original "joke character", Pentaro made an appearence in a previous Gradius title as a flying penguin. However he does star in his own games as well, Konami's Penguin Adventure

5. Hikaru: Hikaru is a girl in a tight fighting "bunny suit" who is riding on top of a missile

6. Mambo: Mambo is a strange looking fish with two horns on the top of his head and on his underside

7. Michael: some kind of fat angel pig. He has wings and a golden halo over his head

8. Koitsu: A blue stick man riding on a surfboard. He's probably one of the more 'normal' characters

9. Goemon: star of the Goemon series of games. Goemon is a ninja warrior equipped with wooden pipes. He flies around in a superman pose for his appearance in Parodius

10. Dracula: star of Konami's Kid Dracula, this white haired squat character retains his vampiric abilities including that of being able to change into a bat

11. Upa: a flying baby. Upa is actually from a Konami game by the name of Bokutte Upa but is probably just more recognizable as "the flying baby" of this crazy shooter

In addition to your player-character, the levels themselves will be full of a strange mix of Konami references, bright colors and the just plain zany. it's not uncommon to have to fly your ship underneath a woman's legs for example or chased by a giant walrus or having enemies shooting cute pink hearts at you.</desc>

	<name>Gourmet Sentai: Bara Yarou</name>
	<desc>In Gourmet Sentai: Bara Yarou the player picks from three characters: Bonjour, Mademoiselle, and Très Bien. Each has slightly different movesets to use on downed or stunned opponents, but each posses the punch, throw, and jump usual for belt-scrolling brawlers. The characters must get past several minor enemies on each level before fighting a stronger boss at the end. Each enemy will drop a cooking ingredient when defeated, and at the end of each level two ingredients can be combined to make a meal that will restore some health based on if the chosen character likes it or not. Environments range from slums and palaces to high speed trains and space ships, but in general there is not much continuity between different areas.</desc>

The baton can be powered up to shoot various types of projectiles, though these powerups are lost if Reiko takes any damage. It can also be used as a type of grappling hook to access certain platforms. There are also limited uses of magic attacks that hit all enemies on the screen.</desc>

	<path>./GT Racing (Japan).bin</path>
	<name>GT Racing</name>
	<desc>GT Racing is a Super Famicom racing video game where the player gets to drive a Gran Turismo car in either championship or practice mode.  The game is based on the 1996 Super GT racing season using the horsepower standards and rules of the era.  

During championship mode, the player is asked enter a number, his or her driver's name, and the team name that he or she will use during the championship. The driver's name and team can be entered using either English or Japanese letters. When a player beats a record, he or she is asked to insert his or her number, name or initials (up to four characters and two digits for the number). Championship mode can last for multiple seasons. Playing ninety-nine seasons in a single racing career is theoretically possible due to the double-digit nature of the season information. There are eight different tracks, including the Suzuka Circuit that has been shown in video games since Pole Position II and Fuji Speedway (complete with a virtually photorealistic Mount Fuji in the background).

Versus mode is for two human players only and the record options allows the players to look at his or her previous records. In a race, there are up to fifteen opponents to race against. The player gets rewarded with an opportunity to upgrade his or her equipment after a top five finish on any race course. Bonus equipment includes a faster engine, better tires, and a special dose of nitrous oxide created specifically for Gran Turismo vehicles. All of the bonus automobile parts are automatically installed in the appropriate parts for supercharging the vehicle. Once all the special parts are earned, the automobile is considered to be fully upgraded. The ultimate goal is to win the Gran Turismo championship for his or her team in addition for him/herself.

The "free practice" is essentially a time trial mode where the player races by him/herself for up to ten laps. Acquiring damage is still possible either crashing into walls or through normal wear and tear. The fastest lap time gets captured for the record book just like in the other modes of the game. Before being able to practice freely, the player can also choose the weather condition and the setup of his vehicle</desc>

	<name>Hameln no Violin Hiki</name>
	<desc>In Violinist of Hameln you play the role of Hamel, a sort of wanderer / adventurer whose weapon is a violin. His music can cover enemies in fear, or even control their minds. Hamel and his mascot Oboe arrives at Staccato, a small town attacked by monsters, and drives them away with his power. Impressed, a cute little girl named Flute decides to go with Hamel in order to find and destroy the evil power behind the attacks.

The game is typical platform. You play as Hamel, and with your violin can shoot musical notes to beat your enemies. However, you count with Flutes aid. Flute follows you (although you can order her to stop and stay), but also can be grabbed and thrown at the enemies (yes, thrown at the enemies). Flute can also collect through all the stages some costumes that, when worn, give her special abilities, such as flying, leaping, breaking walls or even explode and kill all in screen. At the end of each stage, of course, youll find the typical boss, all named as musical instruments.

	<name>Hat Trick Hero 2</name>
	<desc>Hat Trick Hero 2 is the follow up to Hat Trick Hero, and it is loosely based on the arcade game Hat Trick Hero '93. One or two players can play in a exhibition game (one single match) or in a world league. The game scrolls horizontally uses mode 7 graphics to give the playing field some perspective.

There are 18 countries to select from, each with different running, kicking and technical abilities. You can use 5 different formations, which are 4-4-2, 4-3-3, 3-5-2, WM and libero. You also select a team captain from 8 different characters.

You can perform a foul tackle on the opponent, but when the referee is close enough to notice it you risk getting a yellow or red card. By holding down a direction after shooting the players can shoot the ball with curve effect. During the game a power-up bar is charged which can be used for special abilities. Holding down R allows you to run faster, but this slowly drains the power-up bar. With a fully charged power-up bar you can perform an unstoppable hyper shoot by pressing a special combination, and this drains the power-up bar entirely.</desc>

Cast into the role of a young boy from a remote village, you live a peaceful life until one day the pigs in your village go crazy, and as a result you are thrown underground, only to be saved by mysterious fairies. Something goes wrong, and the world as you knew it doesn't exist any more. You must establish contact to the great gods and other famous characters from the Greek mythology in order to restore the balance.

Like the previous games of the series, this is a standard console-style RPG with turn-based combat viewed from first-person perspective. There is a day/night cycle, which influences not only the appearance of the world map and the towns, but also the schedules of the world's inhabitants.</desc>

The background story is based on the manga/animé of the same name. The years is 199X, and the world lies in ruins. Technology can no longer be used, and the land is controlled by fighters of rivaling styles. In this game, you can choose one of the fighter characters of the series: the main hero Kenshiro, his brother and rival Raou, Nanto Seiken fighters Rei and Souther, the assassin Heart, and others. You fight one-on-one, filling an energy bar and performing various attacks and techniques. There is a free fight mode where you choose your opponent yourself, and a two-player mode.

	<desc>Similar to the  sixth installment of the series, this is a fighting game along the lines of Street Fighter or Mortal Kombat. It is based on the main storyline of the manga/animé series Hokuto no Ken, also known as Fist of the North Star. 

After a terrible disaster mankind has stopped advancing the technology, and the world became a huge wasteland, controlled by fighter organizations. The main hero, Kenshirou of the Hokuto Shinken school, falls in love with a girl named Julia, who is abducted by one of the Nanto Seiken fighters, Shin. 

In the game, the player can choose to fight as various characters from the series, including Kenshirou, his brother Raou, the Emperor Souther, the leader of Nanto Seiken Rei, and others. There are three modes in the game: story mode, battle mode, and free fight mode.

In battle mode, the player participates in a tournament by choosing one of the characters. 
In free fight mode, the player choses characters as well as the opponents. During battles, the player must first accumulate energy in order to unleash devastating techniques unique to each character.

	<name>Holy Umbrella: Dondera no Mubo</name>
	<desc>In "Holy Umbrella", you control a schoolboy who lives in modern-day Japan. One day, the sky suddenly turns dark blue, a heavy rain falls onto the city, and the boy finds, halfway between his house and the school, an umbrella which seems to have fallen from the sky. What he does not know is that the umbrella is magical! The moment he touches it, he is transfered to a parallel universe. Immediately, he is attacked by a huge tank, but a strange old man with a talking bird saves him. It seems that an evil creature named Dondera is threatening the country with the terrible monsters she created. But is it really so? You visit the capital town, talk to the emperor, and decide to investigate the matter...

"Holy Umbrella" is essentially a platform action game, but unlike most other games of this genre, it allows you to visit towns, where you control your hero in a standard RPG-like top-down fashion. You can enter houses, talk to townspeople, etc. On platform levels, which are the main part of the game, you have to switch between the hero, the talking bird Bonto who accompanies you on your quest, and the girl Saki, whom you meet later in the game. Every character has his/her own special abilities and own ways of fighting: the hero can slide through air by using the umbrella, Bonto can double-jump on high ledges, Saki can jump on walls, etc. You use your umbrella as a weapon, as well as elemental stones you can collect on your way and throw at enemies. You also find various power-ups and items you can equip on the hero.</desc>

	<name>The Iron Commando</name>
	<desc>Iron commando is a brawler beat-em-up like Final Fight or Streets of Rage with lots of weapons and big end bosses.

The B-movie story is cheesy and does nothing more than accommodate for the action. From the introduction sequence: "The peril came from outer space. A meteorite entered the earth's atmosphere bringing chaos. After observation, the scientists found that the meteorite was radioactive and had to be destroyed. Unfortunately, terrorists from g.h.o.s.t. want the meteorite too. The Iron Commando's mission is to retrieve the deadly body and avoid genetic mutation."

The player or players walk along the levels beating up enemies. On some levels you ride a motorcycle or jeep, even a mine kart, and shoot your way through hordes of enemies. There are several end bosses, some are screen filling like a helicopter and a giant robot.

Some enemies will drop food, grenades or weapons as you beat them into a bloody pulp. There are lots of different Weapons: 9mm guns, shotguns, machine guns, knives, baseball bats. The weird thing is, enemies that use a sword and even dogs will occasionally drop a machine gun or baseball bat.

	<desc>Jaleco Rally: Big Run: The Supreme 4WD Challenge is a rally racing game and sim in which the player takes part in the Paris-Dakar rally. The game actually begins in Tripoli, Libya and passes through around 2,500 miles of African desert, swamp and jungle on the way to Dakar.Jaleco originally developed the game for the Arcades before porting it to the Super Famicom. This home version was never released outside of Japan. The game was also ported to the Amiga and Atari ST, where it is known simply as Big Run.GameplayIn addition to passing each checkpoint under the required time - the checkpoint system ubiquitous in solo racing games of the era - the player must also be aware of environmental dangers along the course and needs to select a sponsor, navigator and engineer team before starting. They must also balance the weight of their car, as too few replacement parts might cause a problem further into the race yet having too many will greatly reduce the car's top speed.</desc>

	<name>Smart Ball</name>
	<desc>The game involves going through 8 stages (broken up into two parts each) of side-scrolling action. At the end of each stage is a boss monster that must be disposed of.

Jerry moves by sliding across the ground and can latch on to walls and climb them. Jerry can also jump, stretch out to cling to ceilings, and also move at a faster pace. Jerry can consume balls that he finds during a stage and can then fire them out of his body at enemies blocking his path. Enemies can also be defeated by jumping on them and then flattening Jerry's body on them. Also, there are flowers that contain items for Jerry to collect. Items include life, which refills health, a 1-up that adds an extra life, and a seed, which will grow a climbable beanstalk when planted. If the player collects the scattered letters that appear in every stage that spell out the name Jerry, the player will earn two extra lives.</desc>

	<path>./Jikkyou Oshaberi Parodius (Japan).bin</path>
	<name>Jikkyou Oshaberi Parodius</name>
	<desc>The third in the Paroidus series, it's the same gameplay and zaniness that substantiated the first two games. Gameplay itself is a copy (a parody rather) of Konami's famous Gradius series in that the screen scrolls from left to right (most times) and you maneuver around the screen destroying waves of enemies and avoiding obstacles. Unlike previous Parodius titles, this game contains a difficulty adjustment option, allowing the player to make things easier... or harder. Also unique to this parodius title is a bit of japanese digital voice that shouts out various things at you while you play. Survival throughout the level earns you a boss fight, which frequently includes some of the strangest characters in the game. Make no mistake, this *is* Gradius,  but with all sorts of strange graphics, music and references to other Konami games... So in other words, it's Parodius!

There are now more power-ups than ever including the standard power-up (red, used to upgrade weapons), the shield power-up (blue) and a variety of different coloured bells. Green Bells will make you huge on the screen, Yellow Bells are worth points (points in turn are worth extra lives), Blue Bells are "big bombs" that clear the screen of enemies/shots and can be saved until you need them, White Bells will give your character a megaphone that will shout out japanese phrases, the characters of the phrases themselves can be used to damage enemies (the power of words!), The Red Bell stockpiles you with three point-defense lasers... only one of which can be activated at a time and disappear after a short while. Finally the purple bell will clear the screen of all but the strongest enemies... and will turn them into power-ups.

This time around there are 16 different characters to chose from and the power-ups and weapons that they use are more unique than ever. Several familiar "faces" return and they've brought along friends to share in the party:
Vic Viper: The "gradius ship" appears once again in this gradius parody, equipped with it's traditional gradius weapons
2. Lord British: The "other" Gradius ship and arguably the more famous of the two. Lord British has weapons similar to Vic but quite different also.Missiles and shields work differently for instance. And Lord British uses a Ripple gun instead of a double shot.
3. Pentaro: It just wouldn't be a Parodius game if Pentaro wasn't involved. Originally from Konami's Penguin Adventure, Pentaro retains the same abilities from previous Parodius games... however his Potion weapon may now hit multiple enemies and his normal weapon shots explode against obstacles
4. Hanako: Also from Penguin Adventure, Hanako the penguin is Pentaro's girlfriend. While Pentaro is blue, she is the red penguin. She plays nearly identical to Pentaro with the exception of her S. Bomb weapon
5. Twinbee: Twinbee, from the Twinbee games is another returning Parodius star. Unfortunately he hasn't been upgraded since previous games, so his weapons are nearly identical; Punching Glove Rocket and all...
6. Winbee: Winbee, also from Twinbee is red and has moves identical to Twinbee, except for one difference... when she has 3 Options available, she can power them up to harm enemies that touch them.
7. Tako: Again, it just wouldn't be a parodius game without a flying octopus. And here he is, still wearing a baseball cap, but otherwise unchanged from previous Parodius games.
8. Belial: A yellow female octopus with a bow in her hair, she is identical to Tako with the exception of her Missile and Double weapons... which are instead identical to the Vic Viper.
9. Soitsu: A stickman (now green) surfing aboard a paper airplane, Soitsu plays similar to Koitsu from the previous game, aside from his colour. His laser weapon is able to charge up to deliver more power and he drops little stickmen onto the ground which occasionally dance around rather than attacking. Additionally he has an "upgrade power" (S. Power) that make all his other abilities stronger
10. Doitsu: Similar to Soitsu but with a Double Laser ability. He is an orange stickman riding on a paper airplane and no "upgrade" power, using normal options instead
11. Upa: Upa aka The Flying Baby is back from the previous Parodius game (as well as his original game, Bokutte Upa) and plays nearly the same. Instead of a shield, he has a Mega Crush power that damages all on-screen enemies... and also has an "Upgrade Power" in the form of Grade Up that makes his other abilities stronger.
12. Rupa: Another flying baby (presumably also from Bokutte Upa), Rupa plays similar tot Upa but with a Multi Spread gun which fires missiles in multiple directions (with each upgrade) and a S.Vulcan gun which automatically aims towards enemies.
13. Mike: A cute little kitten who happens to to have a very powerful wave weapon which can travel through obstacles and enemies. Additionally he has a multiple bomb ability which requires his "upgrade ability" (Grade Up) to get really powerful
14. Rani: Another cute kitten (this one rolled onto his bottom facing forward) with very power weaponry. Some of the highlights include a Reflect weapon wherein the shots bounce off of obstacles. Another is the S laser which travels forward but then homes in Up or Down to hit the enemy. And finally, Rani's missile weapon is two homing bells. Rani also has an "upgrade ability" in the form of Grade Up, however it only upgrades the Reflect Shot.
15. Memim: One of the fairy characters, Memim is a female flying girl with standard female bikini clothing. She carries some unique missile weapons however, whose direction is determined by Memim's current location on the screen when fired.
16. Sue: The other fairy with tight clothing, Sue is unique in that her weapons are upgraded/displayed in a different order from everybody else's in the game. For instance her Option is the 4th weapon on the list rather than the 6th... requiring less power-ups to activate it. However aside from that... all of her weapons are the exact same as the Vic Viper's.</desc>

Select your character with his unique stats and movesets, and go at it against any opponent from four fictional leagues with dozens of moves, submission holds and rope maneuvers in or out of the ring.

The game uses pre-rendered 2D sprites and features Vs, Tournament, and League play for up to four players. Also included is a career mode where you create a wrestler and control each aspect of his career up to his final victory in the inter-league tournament. And you can also configure matches to be standard, tag (with 4 or 6 wrestlers), submission or death-matches which adds such features as live wires and explosives to the ring.</desc>

	<name>Jojo no Kimy na Bken</name>
	<desc>One of the earliest titles based on the animé series Jojo's Bizarre Adventures, this game is not a pure fighter, like Capcom's more known title, but an adventure/RPG hybrid with turn-based fights.

In a futuristic world, there lives a young man named Jojo who holds a terrible power within: the power to drain life from enemies. This power is somehow connected to the evil vampire Dio who is terrorizing the world. Jojo must find faithful companions on his quest to restore peace and to master the power within himself.

In this game, you navigate Jojo in an adventure-like fashion, viewing the hero from third-person perspective. You can call up a menu at any time to choose a command such as "Look", "Talk", etc. Being a Japanese adventure, the game doesn't contain puzzles. from time to time, you'll be attacked by enemies and will fight them in turn-based combat viewed from first-person perspective. Jojo and his party members possess the so-called "stands", super-powerful creatures you summon during fights. before each fight, you'll have to choose one of fice available tarot cards to determine the amount of luck and compatibility of the stands you'll have in the game.</desc>

	<name>Jutei Senki</name>
	<desc>Jutei Senki is a turn-based strategy game, never released outside of Japan. The game takes place in an alternate universe where centuries ago humanity and their tree soldiers called Junei fight against Letum, a race of robots powered by magic.

The player commands the human army. The mission in each battle is to defeat the enemy army or take their headquarters in a limited amount of turns. In the human army's main building, the player can recruit new soldiers, but their number is limited. Each unit has its own statistics, including range, speed and attack power. Battles are carried out automatically, with animations on a separate screen.

There are three mission modes which include Campaign, Tutorial, and Expert modes and there is also a two-player versus mode.</desc>

Episodes are broken up into six levels of combat against several Shockers riding their own motorcycles or cars or other vehicles, followed by a boss battle in the seventh level. After levels 2 and 5 the Kamen Rider will repair any damage and be able to choose from one of 4 limited powerups, such as invincibility, super speed, or a machine gun. Most of the time Kamen Rider will defeat enemies by riding alongside them and punching them, and enemies will try to do the same to ram or shoot him.</desc>

In the late game (as the game follows the MS: Gundam film story) the player controls the Gundam and two Guncannons.

	<desc>Kikou Keisatsu Metal Jack is a scrolling brawler based on the anime of the same name. At the start of the game the player can choose from Red Jack, Silver Jack, or Blue Jack. Red and Silver both have weapons they can find ammo for in levels (a gun and baton, respectively), and all three can do a multiple hit combo or a jumping attack. At the end of a level the Jack will be met by his vehicle which will then merge with his armor. In this form the Jack's attacks are strengthened and he can charge up an attack that hits every enemy onscreen.

There is no story told at any point in the game, so if you want to know what's going on you'll have to track down the anime.</desc>

	<name>Kishin Douji ZENKI: Battle Raiden</name>
	<desc>Once already Chiaki and her reluctant demon servant Zenki have saved the world from the forces of darkness, but apparently once is never enough. Chiaki has a vision of five cloaked figures and knows that only she and Zenki can stop them. At once they set off to track down the demon leaders.

In Kishin Douji ZENKI: Battle Raiden the player takes the role of Zenki. At first, and occasionally through the game, Zenki will be in his powered down form where he can only punch, jump, and dash. After Chiaki recovers her bracelet, or regains her concentration, or whatever she needs to do at the time, she can transform Zenki into his powered up form. In this form Zenki deals more damage and has a much longer list of attacks that get added to as the game progresses, such as a pillar of energy, an electrified punch, and a dashing attack. By picking up scrolls Zenki can do a powerful Rudora attack to all enemies on screen, but this attack damages Zenki as well.

To complete platforming levels Zenki will have to make it to the end of the level while occasionally finding hidden stone monuments that, when destroyed, will drop items as well as alter the level or remove obstacles, allowing Zenki to pass. After a stage's first platforming level is a midboss fight, and after the second platforming level is the boss fight proper.</desc>

	<name>Kouryuu Densetsu Villgust - Kieta Shoujo</name>
	<desc>This game is based on the animé series Villgust. The main hero of the game is Shun, a teenager who lives in modern-day Japan. One day, when he was going back from school with his girlfriend Michiko, Shun noticed a strange red-eyed rabbit. When he tried to follow him, Shun suddenly found himself all alone in a forest clearing. He was immediately approached by a group of four adventurers who said they were members of a group called R.A.G.E. (Resistance Against God of Evil). Apparently, Shun was transported into a parallel medieval world, and an evil organization known as Vile was the one behind Michiko's kidnapping. Shun and his friends will now do anything to help Michiko and to destroy Vile!

This is a traditional console-style RPG. You travel on the world map, visit towns, buy equipment and items, descend into dungeons, and fight random enemies in turn-based combat viewed from a third-person "over-the-shoulder" perspective. The party can hold up to five characters. The characters level up in a standard way, and also get experience and new levels for their magical spells.

The tournament this time is an eating contest, and the game itself plays like a block-lining puzzle game in the grand tradition of Tetris and Puyo Puyo. You must line-up blocks of the same type as they fall in the classic rectangular play area, clearing them before time runs up or they fill the entire screen. Features a 1P tournament mode, and a 2P competitive Vs mode in which you can chain blocks and send them to your opponent as "attacks" in hopes of causing him/her to lose.</desc>

	<name>Kunio-kun no Dodge Ball da yo: Zenin Shgo</name>
	<desc>16-bit sequel to the cult-classic Super Dodge Ball which unfortunately only saw a Japanese release.

The game continues the "Worldwide Dodge Ball tournament" motif of the original in which several teams from around the world compete in side scrolling dodge ball matches to see which one is the best. Gameplay is similar to other sport games in which you control the character that has the ball at the time (although a lead character always marks the formations and generally controls the team), and special moves can be executed to try and eliminate your opponents (such as homing throws and other esoteric moves). 

This sequel also adds more comprehensive tournament mechanics, for instance your performance in each match allows you to buy power-ups and special moves to enhance your players, you can also create a custom team and manage them throughout the tournament by adding or removing members as you see fit (you can even try to lure players from opposing teams). You can also choose among a series of formations and AI profiles in case you play alone, although you can use a multi-tap to play with up to 4 players.

Available game modes include Tournament, Vs and Mechabutsuke mode which is a variation on Vs that involves a free-roaming court and no outfielders.</desc>

	<name>Kuusou Kagaku Sekai Gulliver Boy</name>
	<desc>You are a boy named Gulliver, who lives together with his two best friends - the girl Misty and the young inventor Edison - in Venice, Italy. The evil Prince of Spain, Judou, is after the mysterious Blue Crystals who grant immense power to those who possess them. Gulliver's father was apparently connected to the secret of the Crystals, and was mercilessly killed by Judou. Now Gulliver swears revenge and embarks, together with Misty and Edison, on a grand journey that will take him to several cities and countries all over the world, from Rome to Himalaya.

The game is an action RPG in which you can switch characters. Each one of the three heroes has his/her own attacks: Gulliver is a melee-style fighter, Edison can throw expendable bombs at enemies, and Misty can attack with magical spells. Whenever you switch to a different characters, the inactive characters in your party gradually regain their hit points. There are no weapons and armor to buy or to find in the game, but the character level up and become stronger from defeating enemies, and collect items those enemies drop.

	<name>Laplace no Ma</name>
	<desc>1924, the town Newcam, Massachusetts. On the outskirts of the town stands the Weathertop mansion. It was just an ordinary place until the last owner, Benedict Weathertop, started practicing black magic. He killed his parents and populated the mansion with all kinds of undead. Since then, nobody dared to approach the mansion. But a short while ago, two boys were found dead near this horrible place. Apparently, the boys had tried to enter the mansion. Another evidence pointed out that a girl followed them - but her body hasn't been found yet, and there is a slight hope she might be alive. 
This is where you, the hero of the game, decide to investigate the mystery, and to venture into the mansion...

"Devil of Laplace" is a hybrid between survival horror and traditional Japanese RPG, similar to the pioneer of this genre, Sweet Home for NES. Unlike "Sweet Home", this game has less puzzles and is more oriented towards RPG elements. You are not stuck in the mansion, but can leave it, visit the town, and buy supplies. Later you also visit other locations such as a castle, etc. The battles are random, turn-based, and are viewed from first-person perspective. The hero of the game can recruit three other characters to the party of five available. Each character (including the hero, to whom you assign gender and class) belongs to one of the five character classes: Dilettante, Medium, Detective, Scientist, or Journalist. Dilettante is an all-around character with defensive magic, Medium is a kind of a black mage, Detective is a melee fighter, Scientist can construct powerful machines to perform various techniques, and the Journalist can take pictures of the monsters, which is the only way to gain money in the game.</desc>

	<name>Lennus II: Fin no Shito</name>
	<desc>This is a follow-up to the game "Lennus", which is know outside of Japan as  Paladin's Quest. The game is set in a world of Andell - a floating continent where ancient prophecies and highly advanced technology co-exist. A curse has fallen onto Andell - its four island, once united, are now separated, and are floating away from the heart of the continent, the temple of Andell. The sages of the temple summon a great hero named Farse, who must find a special magic orb for each one of the islands, which is the only way to re-unite them. Farse embarks on his journey, aided by three Terranos, the big-eared inhabitants of Andell.

This is a console-style RPG where you control a party containing the main hero Farse and three Terranos you select out of the available five. You encounter random enemies and bosses and fight them in turn-based combat viewed from first-person perspective. You can use special attacks and magical spells, which don't consume magic points, but take away a certain amount of your hit points. Instead of healing items, you have mini-bottles you can refill with potions in special places in towns. You can equip various magical artifacts which will allow you to use magic spells belonging to eight different elements.</desc>

	<name>Little Magic</name>
	<desc>May is an apprentice mage at Magic School and must pass the final exam.

A puzzle game seen from a top-down perspective. The goal of each level is to open the exit by pushing a magic stone on a designated spot. May can also push objects one tile ahead without moving herself. This is often used to get the stone over water that she can't cross herself. May's other ability is to create magic bubbles. She can create bubbles in three different sizes. Bubbles will pop after a certain amount of time, depending on their size. If they pop while next to the stone or another bubble, the stone or bubble will be moved one space. Since May can create several bubbles simultaneously, it is possible, and often necessary, to create chain reactions to maneuver the stone into the desired position.

As the game progresses, levels become increasingly difficult and new hazards and enemies are introduced. Enemies follow a set movement pattern and can sometimes be stopped, but not destroyed by magic bubbles. Later levels are made more complicated by different types of tiles including: grass that slows down May, ice that May and the magic stone will slip over, spikes that destroy the stone if it is pushed into them, collapsing tiles that can only be walked over once, rune tiles on which May cannot create magic bubbles, teleporters and others.</desc>

	<desc>In "Live a Live", you control seven main characters and play through seven different stories set in seven different time periods: prehistoric age, medieval Europe, feudal Japan, a futuristic world with robots and weird machines, etc. Those stories appear to have no common points, yet after completing all of them, you'll see they are in fact connected - the worlds of all those characters are threatened by the same ultimate evil force.

The combat features many innovations compared to traditional console RPGs: your position on the battle field is important, and certain techniques can be used only from certain positions, and enemy attacks also affect only specific parts of the field. Out of the seven chapters, some have more battle-oriented gameplay, while others are more devoted to puzzle-solving and information-gathering.

The game is one of the least known Squaresoft products, and was never released outside of Japan.</desc>

	<desc>All the king's candy has been stolen by invaders who live down in the dungeon. The king summons twin heroes: Justy and Liberty to try to get it back.

Lode Runner Twin: Justy to Liberty no Daibouken is a side-scrolling platform game, adapted for the SNES from the original Lode Runner. However the atmosphere has changed to a lot more cartoonish and happy. Controlling either Justy or Liberty, the player is able to move back and forth, climb ladders, cross ropes and dig holes in some types of surface. The enemies then fall into these holes and the player can walk over them. The goal in each level is to get all the candy.

There is also a battle mode that puts Justy versus Liberty to see who can fetch the most candy.

	<desc>The game is set in the same universe and shares characters and storyline with  Puyo Puyo puzzle games. Unlike Puyo Puyo, Mado Monogatari is a Japanese-style RPG. You play Arle, a five-year old apprentice magician. She is attending a special kindergarten, and it is time for the Final Exam. At the same time, Arle receives a mysterious letter that tells her that if she finds eight magical gems and takes them to the Wizard Mountain, she'll be granted one wish. Arle decides to search for the gems which are scattered all over the world, and to overcome all the obstacles with her great magic power!

The game features random enemy encounters and turn-based combat, which takes place on a platform (Arle to the left, the enemies to the right). You can't perform physical attacks at all, and your only way of harming enemies is through magic. During the game, you learn a variety of magic spells, which can be upgraded later. In battles you can't see your own and the enemies' hit points, and have to act according to your intuition.

	<desc>This game is based on the anime and manga by manga artist CLAMP.

In the land of Cephiro, the world was kept in peace and harmony by the wishes of Princess Emauraude, the Pillar of Balance. But the evil priest, Lord Zagato, has kidnapped Emauraude, and Cephiro is being invaded by deadly beasts. If this continues, Zagato will gain complete control of Cephiro! The only ones who can stop him are the legendary Magic Knights...

And those Magic Knights are three young girls from Earth. Hikaru Shidou, Umi Ryuuzaki, and Fuu Hououjii have been plucked from modern-day Tokyo and brought to Cephiro by Emauraude, and they're the only ones who can defeat Zagato...as the Magic Knights!

This interpretation of the manga story is a traditional Japanese-style RPG. The player controls the three main heroines as a party; each one uses different weapons and learns various skills. Typically for the genre, the party roams the top-down world, visits towns, descends into dungeons, chats with non-playable characters, and fights randomly appearing enemies in turn-based style.</desc>

	<name>Makeruna! Makend 2</name>
	<desc>The Ghost Prime Minister is holding a fighting tournament, and 14-year-old Hikari Tsurugino, the second Mighty Makendo, must face off against all sort of strange apparitions. Characters from the first game make appearances, including Mai Tsurugino, Hikari's sister and the first Mighty Makendo.

Makeruna! Makendo 2 is a comical VS fighting game with an eclectic cast of characters including a soccer player, a zombie, a musclebound mer-man, and a giant robot. Bouts are best two-out-of-three, and each character has both a life bar and a "Makendo" meter, which lets each character perform a variety of special attacks. The game includes a story mode and a 2-player versus mode.</desc>

Peach and Yoshi should have been together with Luigi......but alas, the visage of Luigi was missing. Mario's group of three have separated to find lost little Luigi.

At once, the suspicious sound of an engine was in the air. I wonder what it could be? It was Wario riding his personal plane, the Bulldog, and it dropped a bucket from the sky.

"Whew, woosh!"

And suddenly, the bucket was a snug fit on Mario's head.

"Uwagh, I can't see in this thing!"

The sprite of the woods, Wanda, witnessed it. The petite pixie did not have the strength to remove the bucket on her own, but she desired to help somehow. Thus, Wanda sends Mario a signal with her magic wand, determined to reunite him with Luigi......</desc>

	<desc>Dr. Hell's robot army has destroyed Tokyo, and now only Kouji Kabuto, and the giant robot Mazinger Z, can stop them from taking over the entire world. Animated cutscenes between levels tell the story of the game.

The Mazinger Z comes with a full armory of anti-robot weaponry, from super-powered karate moves to missiles, Breast Fire, and its signature Rocket Punch. Special moves deplete a regenerating energy meter, while Rocket Punches can be preformed at any time, although Mazinger will be unable to punch until its arms return. Each level contains several varieties of enemies, all of them from the show and unique to each level, that must be defeated to progress. Some enemy robots will fire projectiles from a distance while others will rush in attempt to grapple the Mazinger, and sometimes more than one enemy must be fought at once. Enemies will drop healing items and occasionally an item that upgrades Mazinger's Rocket Punch to the Iron Cutter for a limited time. At the end of each level is a fight with a stronger boss robot with more dangerous attacks.</desc>

	<desc>This is a remake of the game Metal Max, originally for NES. You are a little boy who lives with his father in a town in a futuristic world dominated by machines. Your wish is to become a "hunter" - to kill monsters that roam the world and to receive rewards for that. The storyline and the gameplay basics remained unchanged in this remake. You fight enemies in turn-based combat, and use vehicles, such as your own personal tank Mosquito, to transport yourself through different areas, and to participate in battles. You can also buy equipment and upgrade your vehicles.

The remake features enhanced graphics and sound, background pictures for battles (they were black in the original), slightly different locations (more houses in towns, sometimes different layout of the towns and of the world map), and reduced difficulty level.</desc>

Miracle Girls is based on the characters of the manga and anime of the same name. The player starts the game by picking either Tomomi or Mikage, although they both have the same abilities. Either can jump or toss candy, which will render enemies harmless for a few seconds as they eat it. Enemies incapacitated in this way can be used as platforms. Hidden in levels are bombs that fill the screen with candy, turning any onscreen enemies into heart rings, fruit that increase health, and doors that lead to a celestial slot machine that can reward additional lives. At the end of each level is a different challenge with a boss, such as a top-down squirt-gun fight or a game of matching cards.</desc>

	<name>Monstania</name>
	<desc>The hero of the game is Fron, a sixteen-year old boy who lives on the island of Monstania. One day, strolling in the forest, he notices a strange light. The light lead him to a clearing, and then suddenly disappeared. But Fron realized what was the meaning of that light - it was a fairy! Of course, everybody knew that fairies had been long extinct, but Fron never believed in that. All his life he wanted to meet a real fairy, and now, when the opportunity has come, he firmly decides to find her. His girlfriend Tia helps him on the dangerous journey, during which they meet a mysterious little girl named Chitta, and get involved in a grand adventure, that will ultimately lead them to the battle against the dark force that threatens the whole Monstania!

"Monstania" has a somewhat unusual gameplay within the frames of console RPGs. You don't explore the world in the game: it is entirely linear and takes you to the next destination by itself (only at a few points you can choose where to go next by selecting an appropriate answer). Once within the location, you cannot leave it until you complete all your objectives there, which then take you to the next location. The objective is usually a large strategic battle. You navigate your party members on the battle field, attack with melee and long-ranged weapons, and use special technique which require action points. Unlike most other turn-based strategy games, an enemy makes a move immediately after you did the same with one of your characters, without waiting for the "enemy turn". The RPG element is not very significant: your characters level up automatically after each battle. There are also some puzzles to solve in certain locations.</desc>

	<name>Mystic Ark</name>
	<desc>Seven heroes from seven different Worlds. Seven heroes who were brought to a mysterious temple on a remote island and transformed into statues. Seven heroes who are chosen to bring harmony back to the universe: Miriene the witch (wizard), Lux the tetsujin (a race of iron people), Reeshina the grappler (monk), Tokio the ninja, Kamio the ogre, and Mesia the priestess. The seventh hero is you, the protagonist of the game - the knight Remeer or the female warrior Ferris. Your first task will be to release your companions from the statues they are locked in. You must travel to the Cat World and to retrieve an important artifact. But your main objective is to visit all the seven Worlds and to find seven mystic arks - the items that will re-unite those Worlds and bring peace to them.

"Mystic Ark" is a RPG closely connected to 7th Saga. You travel on overworld map, visit towns, buy equipment, and descend into dungeons. The combat is turn-based and viewed from a third-person "over-the-shoulder" perspective. The battles are not random: the enemies can be seen as white dots on your radar, and if you don't want to fight, you can sometimes outrun or avoid them. The game also contains elements of pure adventure: often you must investigate objects closely and use items from your inventory on them.</desc>

	<desc>The young fighter Ryu was thrown out of his father's home, and this childhood trauma has been dominating his life ever since. His only wish is to surpass his father and to show him he has become a better fighter than him. Laila is a cheerful treasure hunter. She dreams only of valuable things, adventure, travels, and life in the capital city.  Gaou is experiencing a personal tragedy: he wants to discover the mystery of the disappearance of a woman he loved, Asuka, aided by his best friend Froz. Naaga is a girl who wears a heavy armor, which - as she thinks - will prevent her from losing any battle. At present, she has problems since she owes a million gold pieces to her guild. What do those heroes have in common? As their ways cross, they will find out they are in fact pursuing one and the same goal...

"Burning Heroes" lets you start as either one of the four characters. Each one starts in a different place and is seemingly absorbed in his/her personal quest, but as the game progresses, the four heroes meet each other. You should also find and "unlock" four other playable characters as you advance in the game. The gameplay system of "Burning Heroes" is similar to other console-style RPGs: you fight random enemies and bosses in turn-based combat, viewed from third-person perspective, like in Final Fantasy games. As you get hit in a battle, your "passion" (literally "hot blood", nekketsu in Japanese) level rises, and the more damage you take, the quicker you reach 100%. Once the passion bar is full, you can summon a powerful monster and to unleash a devastating attack on the entire enemy party.</desc>

Traveling in faraway lands, Duke heard that his homeland was under attack. He decided to return to Neugier. On the way his ship was attacked by pirates, lead by a mysterious demon named Ord. After he barely escaped the ship, Duke found his way into his father's castle. He realized now that the pirates' attack and the monsters roaming the castle are connected. Although his father doesn't trust him, Duke is determined to save Neugier.

"Neugier" is an action adventure game in which you fight enemies in real-time, slashing them with your melee weapon. You have a "throw chain" ability, which allows you to press objects to the walls, destroying them. You can also push enemies to the walls this way.

	<name>Ou-chan no Oekaki Logic</name>
	<desc>Ou-chan no Oekaki Logic is a digital conversion, with anime mascots, of the classic Japanese newspaper puzzle nonograms. A nonogram is a puzzle on a square or rectangular grid the object of which is to reveal a hidden picture. Along each row and column there is a number or series of numbers which indicate how many squares will be colored in that row or grid. Example; &amp;quot;5 9 4&amp;quot; would mean there would be sets of five, nine, and four colored squares in the grid, in that order, with at least one blank in between. 

Ou-chan no Oekaki Logic adds a story mode where Ou-Chan, representing the player, competes with other blobby anime characters in finding hidden images in the nonogram grids.</desc>

	<name>Tetris Attack</name>
	<desc>All is not well on Yoshi's Island! The devious king Bowser has cast a spell on the island's inhabitants, turning them into his mindless slaves. Only Yoshi has escaped its effects, and so he must set off to free his friends, and to defeat Bowser and break the spell.

Tetris Attack is a fact-paced action puzzler featuring the colorful cast of characters from Yoshi's Island. A stack of blocks continually rises from the bottom of the screen, and the player controls a cursor which can swap any two blocks horizontally. Make a row or column of three or more and they'll clear, potentially creating combos from new blocks falling to take their place. Combos will send large garbage blocks to your opponent, which must be eliminated by clearing a piece that is touching it, turning it into normal blocks.

The game offers a story mode against the computer, as well as a 2-player versus mode, an endless mode, a timed mode where a certain number of blocks must be cleared, and a puzzle mode where a set arrangement of blocks must be cleared in a specific number of moves. The game is based on the Japan-only title Panel de Pon.</desc>

	<path>./Pipe Dream (Japan).bin</path>
	<name>Pipe Dream</name>
	<desc>Each level of this abstract puzzler challenges the player to set up a network of pipes to allow an unspecified substance known as 'flooz' to flow through as many of those as possible. The pieces are offered in random order, and there are seven different types - straight lines going horizontally or vertically, corners rotating in each of the four directions, and cross-over pieces which carry the flooz straight across horizontally and vertically. Each of these can be entered from either side. When the flooz hits a gap, or a piece which the previous piece can't flow into, the pipe is finished.

Before the flooz starts flowing from its randomly-selected starting position, the player has several seconds to start placing pieces. They can be put down anywhere. However a situation that can often occur is there will be a long and complex piping arrangement set up, yet a gap somewhere remains to be filled. Players are able to replace a piece with another in the same square (to make it easier to flow the flooz that way), but for a slight scoring penalty.

Bonuses are awarded for looping the flooz through both sides of at least 5 cross-over pieces, or passing the flooz through every square on the screen. Later levels have some squares on the grid blocked off, a few gaps in the side-wall (allowing flooz to thread to the other side of the screen). After every four levels there is a bonus game for points, in which the player can only place the pieces in the lowest open space in each column, similarly to the board game of "Connect 4".</desc>

	<desc>In this platform action game, you play as a cute bounty hunter known as Popful Mail. While you might think that a cute Anime chick would have no trouble making a living slashing bad guys with her sword, Popful is having a hard time making ends meet.  One day, however, Popful learns about a magician who has gone rogue and has a hefty bounty on his head. So, her adventure begins as Popful fights her way through a new adventure, and makes new friends along the way.

Primarily this is an action game with very slight RPG elements. As you make your way through the plethora of levels, you will have to collect money from slain foes. You use this money in the shops to buy weapons, armor, health, and so on. Also, this game features interaction with many, many characters through both on-screen dialog and fully animated sequences. Some of these characters become playable as you progress through the game.

This release has the same story and general gameplay style as the earlier version, but otherwise was made from scratch, having entirely different graphics, locations, enemies, challenges, etc.</desc>

	<path>./Ranma 1-2 - Akanekodan Teki Hihou (Japan) (Translated En).bin</path>
	<name>Ranma 1/2 : Hidden Treasure of the Crimson Cats</name>
	<desc>The game is based on the animÃ© series Ranma 1/2. It tells the story of the young martial artist Ranma Saotome. Traveling with his father Genma across China, Ranma discovered a cursed spring. When he and his father fell into that spring, they were both transformed: Ranma into a little girl, Genma into a panda bear. Hot water restored them to their original appearance, but whenever they are splashed with cold water, they turn into their "cursed" forms. 

The story of the game begins as Ranma and Genma are having breakfast by their friends. Suddenly, several cat-like creatures burst in and kidnap Genma. Ranma finds out that the cats belonged to Akaneko (Crimson Cat) Gang, who kidnaps strong fighters for some reason. Soon Ranma discovers that Kamusaru, the leader of the Crimson Cat Gang, is looking for an ancient treasure that will allow him to turn into a Nekomaou (Cat Demon King), and take over the world. Ranma and his friends will do anything to rescue Genma and to stop Kamusaru's evil plans!

The game features many characters from the animÃ©, including Ranma's fiancee Akane, the fighter Ryouga, the amazon warrior Shampoo who is in love with Ranma, and others. The game is built like a traditional Japanese RPG: your party fights random enemies in turn-based combat viewed from a third-person, Final Fantasy-like perspective. In battles, you can attack physically, or use various offensive and defensive techniques, which consume "ki" (an equivalent of magic points). Not only Ranma and Genma, but also the other characters in your parties can take a different shape. You carry around a bucket of cold water, and every time you use it on one of your characters, he/she is transformed into a "cursed" form. This is sometimes required to advance the story of the game (for example, Ranma can enter a certain location only as a girl).

	<name>Ranma 1/2 : Hard Battle</name>
	<desc>Another fighting game based on the Ranma 1/2 manga series set around the misadventures of a martial artist that gets cursed and magically transforms into a female version of himself whenever he's splashed with water.

As in previous games the premise simply involves the cast of the series going at each other's throats for ultimate supremacy, although this time you can select any character in either the single player or Vs gameplay modes.

The gameplay itself involves controlling your character in a side-scrolling arena and trying to defeat your opponent either with your basic attacks, special moves (triggered by specific controller motions) or super moves that require you to charge buttons and can only be dealt under specific situations (ie, when your life-bar starts flashing), while avoiding your opponent's attacks in turn.

	<name>Ranma 1/2 : Chougi Ranbu Hen</name>
	<desc>A 2D one-on-one fighting game based on the Ranma 1/2 manga series dealing with the adventures of a male martial artist cursed to transform into a female version of himself when splashed with water.

Ranma 1/2 : Chougi Ranbu Hen pits 12 characters from the series (including the male and female versions of Ranma) against each other in best 2-out-of-3 rounds matches, with the goal being to defeat all the opponents and thus claim a magical lucky cat that will grant the champion whatever he wishes.

Gameplay involves controlling your character in a 2D scrolling arena, in which you attempt to defeat your opponent by using your basic attacks and special moves, all the while avoiding your opponent's strikes. You can also charge up your character until he reaches "super" mode, which allows you to unleash super moves for extra damage, but performing any basic attack negates the super mode.

Features the standard single player and Vs modes along with a Tag Team Vs mode in which two players select a pair of characters and can exchange them in mid-fight for strategic advantage.</desc>

	<name>Ranma 1/2 : Ougi Jaanken</name>
	<desc>The game involves falling blocks of hands displaying the rock, paper, and scissors signs, which fall three at a time. In a similar manner to Tetris, the player can rotate the blocks to stack them, using pieces that defeat other pieces (e.g. paper over rock) to eliminate stacks. Doing so adds garbage pieces onto the opponent's screen to make it more difficult for them to eliminate their stacks of blocks. The objective is to fill up the opponent's screen up with blocks so that additional ones can no longer fit. Each character has two special attacks which can be used when large combinations are completed. Once in each round each player can also use a bucket of water that can transform a cursed character into their alternate form, which weakens their attacks until the effect wears off. This does not affect Akane or the Gambling King.</desc>

Starting with only a single shot,  5 different upgradable weapon systems can be collected as extras. Upon death, the last activated system loses one increment of its current upgrade status, but can be refueled by additional extras collected. Every weapon has also a massive 'smart' bomb feature, wiping out mostly everything on screen at once if invoked. There are also some R-Type style space shooter levels thrown in for good measurement. Very arcady with tons of action. Several boss monsters per level. Level progress is saved via password feature.

But remember, Dr. Wily is mad, but he's not stupid. He had a backup plan...and all he had to do was just wait...

6 months had passed, and somewhere from deep within Wily's abandoned lab, 4 hidden capsules activated and opened. His backup plan was in action...he had hidden 4 new Wily Robots that would spring him out of jail so he could continue his mad reign.

When Mega Man hears the word that Wily was busting out of prison, he rushes onto the scene, only to encounter a strange robot he had never seen before named Bass. Bass tells Mega Man to back off, that he would stop Wily, and that Mega Man was no longer needed.

Think that's gonna stop Mega Man? No way! Mega Man takes off to put a stop to Dr. Wily and find out exactly whose side Bass is on...</desc>

	<path>./Romancing SaGa (Japan) [En by Trans Dimension v0.40] (Incomplete).bin</path>
	<name>Romancing SaGa</name>
	<desc>Once upon a time, three evil gods fought against the holy gods, and the holy God-Father chose a human warrior to help them. Finally, after a prolonged, terrible war, the leader of the three evil gods - Death, the eldest of them - surrendered. The youngest evil god, Schirach, became a human and has lost her powers. The middle one, Saruin, was sealed away in the dark world. Now, after thousand years have passed, and the seal of Saruin has weakened, it is time for you, the hero of the new generation, to defeat him.

Romancing SaGa is the fourth installment in the long SaGa series - non-linear role-playing games with several main heroes. It is the first of three Super Nintendo entries. The first three games in the series were on the Gameboy and were known as "Final Fantasy Legend" outside of Japan. In this game, you play the stories of eight characters, which will later unite to face the ultimate evil. The eight characters belong to different classes and have different abilities. There are four male characters (noble son, thief, adventurer, and pirate), and four female ones (nomad, ranger, dancer, and savage). The combat is turn-based, with enemies visible on screen. Taking a cue from Final Fantasy II on the NES, instead of "Leveling" your character as a whole you level specific abilities such as a type of weapon or magic, as well as, stats such as HP and Strength and Intelligence. New to this entry abilities are randomly unlocked during battle as a light-bulb appears over the characters head and the new ability is unleashed to the surprise of friend and foe. This serendipitous element of gameplay along with the multiple heroes to choose from greatly enhance the replay value as no two playthroughs are alike. Which is good considering the steep learning curve of the SaGa games which require multiple playthroughs to truly master the system.

"Romancing SaGa" was never released outside of Japan until the Playstation 2 remake "Romancing SaGa: Minstrel Song"</desc>

	<desc>Every 300 years the Death Eclipse kills all newly born creatures. Men, women, and children, animals and plants, even ferocious monsters - no one can survive the devastation caused by the Eclipse. No one except a child chosen by the destiny. 600 years ago, such a child survived the Death Eclipse, only to become a demon king. During the next Eclipse, a chosen child became a holy king, and he defeated the evil demon king. Now, when the next Eclipse is nearing, nobody knows who the next fortunate survivor will become - a demon or a holy man?

In "Romancing SaGa 3", you can play through the story controling any one of the eight main characters - Julian, Monica, Mikhael, Harid, Katarina, Thomas, Elena, and Sarah. The story is common for all eight characters, and they often join together and share the same piece of a story. The princess Monica learns about a rebellion planned by a treacherous Baron to dethrone her brother, Marquis Mikhael. She goes to warn him, but on her way, she loses her horse, and has to stop in an inn of the town Shinnon. There, she meets travelers who agree to lend her a horse and accompany her to see her brother. When they finally reach Mikhael, a war begins...

"Romancing SaGa 3" has a refined upgrading system: you can upgrade your weapons and your spells by using them continuously. The party combat is turn-based, and there are also strategic army-vs.-army battles you'll have to command.</desc>

	<name>Rudra no Hihou</name>
	<desc>The Earth is ruled by heavenly powers, who destroy it and create it again every 4000 years, to end the live of powerful races and to let new ones appear. Many years ago, four great races dominated the Earth: the wise Danans, the beautiful Mermaids, the proud Reptiles, and the strong Giants. But those races had to give place to a newly born race: the humans. During the era of the humans, the planet's air has become filled with smog and the water dirty with pollutants. The cult of the Rudra have appeared and begun fortelling the end of the world. As the 4000 year deadline approaches, three characters each embark on their separate yet intertwined quests.

Sion is a young warrior who wants to take part in a ritual tournament and become the strongest of the kingdom. However a capture of one of the Cultists of Rudras soon complicates his training.

Surlet is a wise magician who is interested in archeology and history of the Earth. He is also a pupil of the famous professor Muench who recently made a very important discovery regarding ancient ruins

Riza is a young druid who lives with her grandfather in a quiet village. She was born with a mysterious jade on her forehead, and now feels the urge to save the world from an inevitable, yet unknown disaster.

Rundra no Hiho is a turn-based RPG, similar in gameplay and graphics to the better known Final Fantasy VI. Whenever players load the game cartridge, they are able to choose which of the three characters they wish to play. This allows any one of these quests to be saved and put aside for any amount of time, allowing the player to change between characters as they so desire. Regardless of which character is chosen, the game is displayed as a top-view on the overworld and in towns. Players can move around to different locations, search treasure chests and talk to townspeople. On the overworld and in dungeons, random encounters can occur. During battles the game is displayed from a side-view and is turn-based between the player's characters and monsters. Players are able to Fight with their weapon, use mantras (magic), use items, defend or run away. Defeat of monsters will result in the party earning experience points and money, which can be spent to buy new weapons, armor and items.

The game's mantra (magic) system is unique in that all spells are formed up of syllables, each with it's own effect (for instance, the syllable "Ig" represents fire and the syllable "ga" augments any mantra's power over it's basic form. Therefore "Igga" is a more powerful version than "Ig" alone). Syllables must be arranged in proper combinations in order to form effective magic spells. Hints towards some of these combinations can be found inside treasure chests or by talking to townspeople.

Many of the problems that existed in the first game have been fixed in this installment (it is easier to execute special moves, you no longer have only Ryo or Robert to choose from in 1 player mode, etc.).

	<name>Seiken Densetsu 3</name>
	<desc>Seiken Densetsu 3 is set in the same world as the two previous Seiken Densetsu games (the first is Final Fantasy Adventure, and the second is most known as Secret of Mana). The mysterious power of Mana is also the center of all events in Seiken Densetsu 3. Years have passed, and all the destructive powers of Mana have been securely sealed by Mana Swords into eight seeds, all placed in eight different kingdoms. But some people know about those sealed powers, and they don't want to free them for the sake of humanity, but for their own gain - such as the kingdom of Altena, which is slowly freezing and which can be saved only by the legendary powers.

The game features several plot lines connected to each other by their common background. In the beginning of the game, you are offered to choose a group of three among six different characters of different classes: Duran the Fighter, Angela the Magic User, Lisa the Amazon, Carlie the Cleric, Kevin the Grappler and Hawk the Thief. Each one of them has her/his own background story and dwells in a different land. Gradually, the connections between those different characters become apparent, and the seemingly loose story lines are connected into a whole.

Seiken Densetsu 3, like the previous game of the series, is an action RPG, with real time combat.</desc>

	<desc>A 2D side-scrolling beat 'em up, Sengoku casts you and a friend as two renegade fighters out to beat the crap out of the many assorted gangs that threaten the post-apocalyptic cities of the future. Unfortunately for them they also get caught in a time-warping scheme caused by the evil Nobunaga who attempts to invade the time period with mythical warriors and evil creatures from the Japanese sengoku period.

The game thus takes you from the city to a spirit-realm from time to time, in which you must fight all sorts of Japanese mythical figures, and release three haunted spirits that can aid you in your battle. Collecting orbs from defeated enemies allows you heal up, gain weapons and even energy attacks and also summon the warrior forms of the spirits you released, which change your character's form and give you a new collection of attacks and powers.

	<name>Shin Megami Tensei</name>
	<desc>A young man lives together with his mother in Kichijoji, a district in modern Tokyo. One day, he has a strange dream: he is being sucked into another dimension, a strange maze-like structure. A spirit appears in front of him and asks him his name. As he proceeds further, he meets a man who is hanging on a cross, another one who is being tormented by a demon, and a mysterious young woman who is bathing in a pool...

"Wake up!" - the voice of his mother cuts through the dream. The young man wakes up and checks his computer. Suddenly, a message arrives: the world is headed towards destruction. Only he who can summon demons through a virtual space will be able to prevent a disaster. What could that mean? The young man goes outside and finds out a murder has occurred in the nearby park. The district must be cut off from the rest of the city until the murderer is found. This was the beginning of the demon summoner's story...

"Shin Megami Tensei" is a first-person RPG set in modern-day and futuristic Tokyo. The hero of the game can summon demons, who use a mysterious energy called Magnetite. The demons can fight for you and perform other useful tasks. The first-person combat is turn-based. In the beginning of the game, you can set the statistics of your party members, determining their strength, stamina, intelligence, etc. You'll need to make some crucial decisions during the game, that will also influence the outcome of its events.</desc>

	<name>Shin Megami Tensei II</name>
	<desc>Shin Megami Tensei II is a direct sequel to the  first game. The events of this game take place 20 or 30 years after the hero of the first game followed the neutral path, defeated the Asura Lord and the seraph Michael at the Cathedral, and founded a state where followers of both Law and Chaos ideals could live freely. But his reign of freedom doesn't last long. The Mesia faith gains power, expanding the Cathedral into a new enclosed environment named Millenium. The Gaians rise up, but their rebellion is repressed by the Mesians' elite warrior class, the Temple Knights. Some years later, a retired arena fighter Okamoto discovers a man fighting for his life against a demon. He rescues the man, who doesn't even remember his own name, and trains him to fight in the arena so they might both go on to a better living in one of the upper-class areas of Millenium. And thus the new battle for a better future begins...

"Shin Megami Tensei II" features all the gameplay innovations of the previous game. You can summon demons, fuse them, make them battle for you, talk to random enemies and receive information from them, etc. The combat is turn-based, and you explore the dungeons from a first-person perspective view.</desc>

	<name>Shin Nekketsu Kouha Kunio-kun: Kunio-tachi no Bank</name>
	<desc>Another beat 'em up in the Nekketsu Kouha Kunio-Kun series. 
The eternal rebel Kunio and his pal Riki finally get to face the long arm of the law when they get both arrested for killing a couple of bystanders in a hit-and-run incident. Problem is they are innocent and the lookalike killers are still out there! Kunio and his pal now have to break out of the prison and go kick some butt in the name of justice (and to clear their names of course).

Gameplay involves defeating all opponents using your arsenal of attacks and special moves (as well as any weapons you may find around) and completing the many side scrolling stages that make up the game, usually after beating an end level boss.

Kunio and Riki are not alone in their quest, as their hard boiled girlfriends, Misako and Kyouko, can join up and provide their unique collection of special moves to the mix. Biking sequences in which you try to get to another part of town while fending-off opponents Road Rash-style are also added for additional gameplay and the game uses several non-interactive cutscenes and dialogues to carry the plot forward.</desc>

	<name>Shounen Ashibe</name>
	<desc>Shounen Ashibe: Goma-chan no Yuuenchi Daibouken (lit: "Boy Ashibe: Goma-chan's Great Amusement Park Adventure") is a Super Famicom platformer from Nova Co. and Takara. The player alternates between controlling the human Ashibe, as he escorts his friends across a world map while talking to NPCs and following the game's story, and the seal Goma-chan in 2D platformer stages where he must track down eight items by investigating his surroundings thoroughly. While Goma-chan can't be hurt by enemies, colliding with them causes him to lose one of the eight items he's already found - as the stages have a strict time limit, it's best to avoid this situation whenever possible.

	<name>Shounen Ninja Sasuke</name>
	<desc>Shounen Ninja Sasuke ("Boy Ninja Sasuke") is a comedic brawler published by SunSoft exclusively for the Super Famicom. The player, as the eponymous ninja, must rescue the daughter of a local lord by fighting his way through hordes of masked bandits led by a mysterious warlord. A second player can join in as Sasuke's monk friend Chin-nan. The game has a distinct sense of speed and verticality, and it's recommended that the player(s) try running and jumping around performing aerial attacks rather than staying on the ground and getting quickly swarmed by enemies.The game was published by SunSoft and developed by an unknown developer, though Mint is thought to have contributed to its sound design. A US SNES localization, with the title Boy Ninja Sasuke, was briefly considered but then axed.</desc>

	<name>Slayers</name>
	<desc>"Slayers" is based on an manga series of the same name (also known as Lina the Teenage Sorceress). The heroine of the manga (and of the game) is Lina Inverse, a seventeen-year-old girl who can use magic and is also proficient with the sword. Lina particularly likes money, and often robs rich people and hunts for treasure. She also has a sense for justice - if a village or a town is in trouble, Lina will do anything to protect it and to fight the bad guys! In the game, Lina is knocked down after a fight against mysterious attackers, and is found by the inhabitants of the nearby village. The trouble is, she can't remember anything! When she meets her long-time companion Naga, their first objective become to investigate the goblin attacks on the population, but Lina's ultimate quest is to regain her memory and to find out who or what has attacked her.

The game is a traditional console-style RPG with towns, dungeons, random enemies, and turn-based combat viewed from first-person perspective, in a Dragon Warrior fashion. The characters can attack physically or use special attacks. Lina can also cast various magical spells. You cannot travel on the world map, but "jump" to various locations instead. The game features animé-style cut scenes.</desc>

	<desc>The game is a less of a self-contained game and more a collection of four smaller ones; including a point-and-click segment featuring Schroeder. The player controls Woodstock and direct Snoopy as he performs all sorts of errands for different Peanuts characters. The player does a separate game for each character; some of them require him to do a little detective work, or to direct Snoopy to win a race, or to get a character to some place. The ultimate goal in the game is to get everyone in shape for Snoopy's concert. Games can either be played using stereo or monoaural sound.

The music was composed by Hirokazu Tanaka (?????)[2] and Minako Hamano (??????),[2] in addition to arrangements of the familiar works of Vince Guaraldi known to longtime Peanuts fans. Many years later the game has been translated to English (by Aeon Genesis) and Portuguese.</desc>

	<desc>A puzzle spin-off title from the Ganbare Goemon series. Goemon has been captured and his friend Ebisumaru goes out to try to find and rescue him. In order to do so, he must traverse a series of maze-like levels avoiding obstacles and enemies and get to the end zone.

The game is played from an isometric perspective from which you can get a good view of the mazes and Ebisumaru. You have no direct control of Ebisumaru per se, but instead switch special blocks around the mazes that can change Ebisumaru's direction of travel and such. You must reach the end of each stage before time runs out, and get all the power-ups and items laid in each maze in hopes of getting to Goemon alive.</desc>

	<desc>The fourth addition to the Bomberman series for the SNES.  This game is almost identical to Super Bomberman 3 only with new levels and a new story.

A small twist in this game is that instead of choosing the traditional bomberman or a country specific character players get to choose between bosses from the previous game when playing battle mode. Each character has a special power from a jet pack to throwing abilities.</desc>

	<name>Super Bomberman 5</name>
	<desc>The fifth and final Bomberman released for the SNES (so far).  This game is very similar to Super Bomberman 3 and 4.  Again there is a new story and new battle arenas but other than that it is the same game.  Players choose between the bosses of the story game levels in battle games like in Super Bomberman 4 yet they have not special powers this time around.</desc>

	<name>Super Fire Pro Wrestling - Queen's Special</name>
	<desc>Long before the WWE introduced the Divas wrestling matches, in Japan there was a more serious affair, where wrestling skill was more important than breast implants, and matches were "real" (as far as wrestling goes) instead of pillow-fighting or bra and panties fights.

In this game in the Fire Pro Series, the cast of the All Japan Women's Pro-Wrestling promotion are available, all fighting to win the Red belt, the highest prize of the federation. It's also possible to fight in single matches, tournaments, Battle Royal and Elimination matches. The usual array of options in CAW is present, being possible to create 16 new Wrestlers.

Gameplay, as usual is the series, is dramatically different than in most western games. Each wrestler has a bunch of moves, ranked from weak to strong. While it's possible to connect any of them from open situations, while grappling only when the opponent is already beaten the most powerful moves can be successfully used.

	<name>Super Fire Pro Wrestling Premium X</name>
	<desc>In this final appearance of Fire Pro series on 16-bit consoles, the usual roster of over 150 wrestlers from several wresting promotions worldwide including several styles from Shoot or Pancrase to American and Lucha are joined by 80 Create-a-wrestler slots, plus secret wrestlers such as legends Gotch or Thesz or the roster of Blazing Tornado. While all fighters have fictional names, a lot of them are perfectly recognizable by their attire, stance and style. The CAW mode allows the player to create a wrestler from scratch, setting how they look (choosing face, size, clothing and setting colours) and fight, with several styles and stances available, as well as over 500 moves, each more suitable for certain styles and skills. To make them fight more realistically when controlled by the AI, the CAW mode also allows one to set move priorities.

Five game modes are available, including World Championship (single and tag), Battle Royale, 5-man Elimination Mode, League Battle and the One Night Dream Match. There are several referees available (each with their own quirks) and variant rules, from allowing fighting outside the ring without count-out (or disallowing it) to the disabling of disqualifications from illegal moves.</desc>

Tubes of random shapes drop on to a board, and by rotating and placing them you have to make shapes that join up in loops. Once you have placed a piece you can't remove it, except by using a special items which destroy every part of an incomplete loop it touches; every tenth loop takes you to a new level.</desc>

	<name>Super Nazo Puyo - Rulue no Roux</name>
	<desc>A spin-off of the successful action puzzle series Puyo Puyo with a twist. Whereas the main Puyo Puyo games are aimed at defeating AI or human controlled opponents in puzzle duels (where each player has his own play area in which color-coded "puyos" fall and must clear them out faster than his opponent). Nazo Puyo instead challenges the player with different single-player scenarios in which a specific objective must be completed (such as clearing only the red Puyos, or performing a specific sequence of combos, etc.).

The game uses the mold of a top-down RPG in which you control the young magician Arle as she explores towns and dungeons in her search for adventure. Each quest involves finding an NPC who will trigger one of the aforementioned scenarios and rewards Arle with experience points and unique items that increase her stats.

	<desc>Sequel to the original Super Nazo Puyo, SNP2 is a Puyo Puyo spin-off which combines arcade puzzle elements with RPG gameplay.

You play as the young magician Arle as she sets out looking for adventure all over the land, chatting with NPCs and exploring the game world via a standard top-down RPG interface. Quests involve careful exploration and solving Nazo Puyo challenges which involve specific scenarios of puzzle-based gameplay which the player must solve under a specific timeframe. These sequences give the player a play area in which color-coded "puyos" are pre-arranged in different patterns, and the player must position and arrange the ones that start to fall in order to fullfil the objective at hand (clear only a certain row or color of puyos, reach a certain number of combos, etc.). Additionally, running into specific monsters can trigger standard Puyo Puyo duels, in which both players have their own play areas and the objective is to clear the screen faster than the opponent.

	<desc>Super Sokoban (or Soukoban) is a puzzle game in which the player must push crates around a maze to their designated storage area, ensuring they do not accidentally push a crate into a position where it cannot be recovered. Thinking Rabbit created the original game in 1982 on home computers, and Super Sokoban is the first Super Famicom game to follow the same blueprint.

The intro establishes that the eponymous Sokoban, or warehouse worker, must perform enough box-pushing puzzles to earn enough cash for a flashy new car so that he might finally impress the girl of his dreams.

An added wrinkle is that each stage has a fixed move limit, and so the player must not only push the boxes in the right order but do so with maximum efficiency. The game was not released outside of Japan.</desc>

	<name>Super Tetris 2 + Bombliss</name>
	<desc>Super Tetris 2 + Bombliss is one of the many versions of the famous soviet puzzle game, the first one available for the Super Nintendo, and an updated version of Tetris 2 + Bombliss.

As the title would suggest, the game features both standard Tetris as well as another similar game called Bombliss. Tetris offers three game modes: standard marathon (A-type), start with garbage (B-type), and rising garbage (C-type). There is also a two-player versus mode where clearing rows sends garbage to the other player.

Bombliss is slightly different from normal Tetris. Arranged on the board and in some dropped pieces are bomb squares. Completing a row does not clear the blocks in the row, but will trigger any bombs in the row which will destroy blocks. Different sizes of bombs will generate larger explosions. Bombliss is offered in standard marathon mode, a puzzle mode where a set board must be cleared using set piece drops, and a 2-player versus mode.</desc>

	<name>Super Tetris 3</name>
	<desc>Super Tetris 3 is yet another version of the famous soviet puzzle game. However, despite what the title may suggest, contained within are actually four different versions of Tetris: Tetris Classic, Familiss, Sparkliss, and Magicaliss. Tetris Classic, of course, is the basic version of the game, which comes with an endless mode and a 25-line "standard" mode. Familiss, as the name might suggest, is a family mode for up to four players simultaneously. Sparkliss, meanwhile, is very similar to Bombliss from Super Tetris 2, only with a medieval fantasy theme and different explosion patterns. Sparkliss includes both a stage mode and a puzzle mode.

The most unique mode is Magicaliss, which has never shown up on any other version of Tetris. In Magicaliss, pieces come in three basic colors, and by rotating the piece, the player can choose between them. Creating a line entirely out of one color will clear all blocks on the screen of that color. There are also grey pieces, which can only be cleared by creating a line made entirely from one color, which will cause all grey blocks on screen to become that color. There are also rare rainbow pieces which will act as any color. Besides these additions, the game itself is basic Tetris.

Tetris Classic, Sparkliss, and Magicaliss can also be played in a two-player battle mode, besides the four-player Familiss mode.</desc>

	<name>Tales of Phantasia</name>
	<desc>In "Tales of Phantasia", you play a young boy named Cless, who lives together with his parents in a quiet village. It was a day like all the others when Cless decided to go hunting with his best friend Chester. Chasing a wild boar, Cless discovered a strange talking tree in the forest who was pleading him for help. But as soon as it stopped speaking, the two friends heard the sound of an alarm. They returned to the village and found it burnt down, and all its inhabitants murdered. Before Cless' mother died in his arms, she told him this terrible massacre had something to do with the pendant she and her husband gave Cless for his birthday... what connection could there be? Cless decides to visit his uncle who lives in another town, but he doesn't realize his journey will take him to much more remote places than that!

"Tales of Phantasia" presents a unique combat system: The battles have a lot in common with fighting games: you fight on a platform that slowly scrolls forward and have to attack your enemy in real time. Other party members are controlled by AI. You can pause the game at any time and use magic, items, or choose an overall strategy for your allies.</desc>

	<name>Tenchi Muyou ! Game-Hen</name>
	<desc>Sasami is kidnapped by a mysterious little girl with magical powers, and Tenchi and his companions must travel to rescue her, battling monsters and other creatures on the way.

Tenchi Muyou! Game-Hen is a strategy game with RPG elements, based on the popular Japanese Tenchi Muyo! cartoon series. The game moves from battle to battle, with the plot being revealed through cutscenes between them. The player fights the computer on turns, controlling the individuals from a party of four. The party members are selected on a separate screen before each battle, and as the game progresses new characters become available.

During the skirmish, selecting the characters brings up a menu with three command options: move, attack or end turn. A fourth transform option becomes available later, after they reach a higher level. When moving or attacking, glowing tiles on the ground show the maximum range of the action. Performing either one costs action points, shown as eight regenerating green dots on the status window, alongside basic statistics like health, defense and attack levels. Characters level up automatically while on the battlefield, increasing their abilities and receiving more powerful attacks. Health powers are also accessed through the attack menu, recovering lost points to an ailing comrade within their range. Characters can transform to a more powerful version when they have the ability to do so, and all the eight green dots are still available. The transformed unit has more powerful attacks and a wider range of movement.

After the battle, a map screen appears where the player can save the game, and choose the next battle from one of the available paths. It is possible to revisit battlegrounds, to level up before tackling stronger enemies.

	<name>Torneko no Daibouken - Fushigi no Dungeon</name>
	<desc>Torneko (aka Taloon) from Dragon Quest IV was a merchant and treasure hunter who always dreamed of owning his own shop. Having defeating the evil along with other heroes, he returned to Endor to work peacefully. Some time has passed and after growing successful in this town, Torneko grew anxious. Hearing rumors one day about a "Mysterious Dungeon", Torneko meets with the king to ask permission to set up a new shop, closer to this Mysterious Dungeon. By exploring this cavern and returning safely with the prizes, Torneko hopes to become the most successful merchant in the world.

Torneko No Daibouken is a overhead view game similar to Hack, what might be called a "dungeon crawl". Torneko must venture into the mysterious dungeon gathering treasure. He may equip any weapons and shields he finds there, as well as gather up items such as spell scrolls, staffs and herbs with a variety of effect. A variety of enemies, familiar to the Dragon Quest series, await him. If Torneko successfully exits the dungeon, he is able to sell any of the items he has collected. This money then goes to improve the quality of his shop and living quarters. As the game progresses, Torneko is able to store special items in the vault, which he is then able to bring with him on subsequent trips to the dungeon.</desc>

	<name>Treasure Hunter G</name>
	<desc>Brothers Red and Blue G. decide to leave their idyllic village in search of their long lost father, who left the kids years ago to go treasure hunting. Unfortunately, as soon as they begin their quest, they become entangled with a mysterious girl on the run from evil monsters who holds the key to the resurrection of a great demon. Now its up to the brothers to save the world if they ever want to find their father.

Treasure Hunter G is a top-down RPG in which you control your party of four characters as they explore the fantasy/sci-fi game world in search for quests and grinding their stats while the plot advances. The game is divided in a world-map screen, a top-down "town" mode and a turn-based fight mode in which the characters are taken to generic tiled top-down arenas in which they select each character and move or attack depending on their action points.

Enemies can be seen on the map instead of jumping at you at random intervals, and you can freely decide whether to engage them or simply circle them around. The game uses a combination of hand-drawn sprites and CGI pre-rendered one (mostly for the main characters) with a distinct cute or Super Deformed design (as usual for most console RPGs).</desc>

	<name>Uch no Kishi: Tekkaman Blade</name>
	<desc>Uchu no Kishi: Tekkaman Blade's is based on the anime Tekkaman Blade, also known as Teknoman. The game's levels are a mix of scrolling shooter and fighting game. The first part of every level is a scrolling shooter where Tekkaman Blade must survive several waves of Radam before killing two stronger boss-like Radam and meeting another Tekkaman. In scrolling shooter levels Blade can either toss his spear to defeat enemies at range or quickly slash with it to destroy bullets and enemies. One enemy type will drop different colored System Box powerups: green restores health, red destroys all enemies onscreen (except bosses), and blue turns Blade invulnerable and able to destroy all enemies upon contact (including bosses).

The end of every level is a one on one fight with an enemy Tekkaman. Each Tekkaman starts with a weapon, but the weapon will be lost if they take too much damage, forcing them to use punches and kicks. This mode can also be played in 2-player mode, where each player selects their Tekkaman.</desc>

	<path>./Wonder Project J - Kikai no Shounen Pino (Japan) (Translated En).bin</path>
	<name>Wonder project J</name>
	<desc>There was once a great scientist and inventor named Gepetto, who lived on an island farm together with his creations, his robotic helper, the pixie Tinker, and his pet animals. His greatest creation was an artificial boy named Pino. No, he was not carved from wood, but looked just like a real boy - only he could turn his head 360 degrees. But Gepetto was arrested for an unknown reason. The boy Pino looks like a real boy, but he was completed just a few moments ago, and he knows absolutely nothing. All he can do is wander aimlessly, poking objects and turning his head. It is up to you, the player, to make Pino a real man!

In this simulation/role-playing game, you must use the robotic pixie Tinker to educate Pino. You can move Tinker around, examining objects and collecting them in an adventure-like fashion. Pino will automatically follow you to the direction you are facing, but will continue walking until you stop him. He will also pick objects and make his own "experiments" with them. Your goal is to train PIno in various disciplines. His stats can be raised in a RPG style: reading books increases his intelligence, throwing a ball increases his dexterity, and so on. By praising or scolding Pino you will gradually make him understand what should be done and what not.

To play, you move the randomly placed cookies into rows and columns of cookies with similar patterns. When you successfully assemble a row or column of the same cookies, the line will disappear, and you can begin on a new row or column. The "Yoshi" cookie is very special in both the 1-player and the 2-player game. Since the Yoshi Cookie is the key to both games, you must use it wisely.</desc>

	<desc>After having defeated the ultimate evil in his previous adventure, the great hero Adol stands on a sea shore, thinking about the fate of the once peaceful Utopian land of Ys, while the wind is blowing through his red hair. Suddenly, Adol notices a bottle, thrown onto the shore. It contains a letter, written in a foreign language, in which an unknown person asks Adol to come to his land and save it from a mysterious evil. Adol decides to accept the offer, and thus his adventure begins again...

Ys IV: Mask of the Sun is an action RPG with a combat system like the earlier Ys games. An enemy should be rammed from the sides in order to hurt him. If performed incorrectly, the player will get hurt himself. It's also possible to use magic and position oneself strategically in battle so that the enemy won't be able to inflict any damage.

The game is a series of set-piece battles where two opponents build up gauges using the D-pad and one of the face buttons: each combination leads to a separate attack and requires a different amount of build-up. The player can go through the story mode, which recounts events from the manga, or they can play a "free" mode against opponents of their choice.</desc>

The game casts you as a wrestler of your choice in the official Zen Nippon Pro Wrestling league and pits you against the other featured wrestlers in grappling matches. As in the original you get to pick between several game modes including: Tournament, Championship (single or tag) Vs, Team (with the new 4-player variant) and Training.</desc>

Because the game takes place in the "near future" and it was released in the mid-1990s, the game itself is referring the story of the game to the first decade of the 21st century.

This game received a sequel in the form of Zero4 Champ RR-Z.</desc>

	<name>Acrobat Mission</name>
	<desc>Years ago humanity abandoned the over-polluted Earth to make a new home on Mars. Now, without warning, a mechanical moon has appeared in the skies over Mars, and is raining down destruction on the colonies. A plan is hastily put into action to destroy the moon and its armada of space-craft. Due to the impossible task of surviving a direct assault, the mission is code-named Acrobat Mission.

Your spaceship in Acrobat Mission is capable of firing a single straight ahead shot. By picking up a Wide upgrade, more shots are added that fly off at an angle, and the shot can be charged up to unleash a continuous short range cone of energy. Picking up a Hurricane upgrade will cause bullets to circle you defensively before shooting forward, and charging will store a full round of bullets up to be fired straight ahead all at once. Up to two bombs can be held at once, and if an enemy bullet hits a bomb it will detonate, saving your ship from damage. If your ship is hit, however, then you will have a few seconds to ram it into whatever shot you and take them down with you. Unlike most scrolling shooter games contact with an enemy ship will not kill you, but they can still push you into the path of bullets.

Play takes place over five levels, first of your launch on Mars, then the approach to the moon, and finally infiltrating the base to destroy its core. Each level ends with a unique boss except stage 4, which ends with 3 bosses.</desc>

	<desc>Past and future are connected in a way mortals do not understand...  A star was glowing up in the sky, and the demon god Alcahest appeared, bringing chaos and destruction to the world. A single swordsman stood in defiance. The four powers that protect the world, the Guardians, gave him their power, and with it the swordsman slew the demon and restored peace in the world. 

Thousand years have passed. And a new battle is already on the way. A cruel emperor leads his troops towards conquest. The kingdom of Panakeia is defending itself with the aid of its knights. Once again, the ominous star shines in the sky, indicating the demon's revival. With the help of Alcahest's power, the evil emperor wants to conquer the world. But the new generation also brings the new hero - the brave swordsman Alen. Aided by the Guardians, Alen must stop the Empire's evil plans and to destroy Alcahest once again.

This is an action game with RPG elements. You wander around slaying enemies in real time combat, gathering treasure on the way, and occasionally participating in boss battles. When you gather enough experience from fighting, you gain extra hit points. You can also upgrade your weapons. On the way you'll meet some characters who will join your party for short time, and you'll be able to use their special attacks and magic.</desc>

Alliances are made, forming two major sides: The Axis and The Federation.  The elite units in these wars are Assault Suits, man-piloted combat mechs called Assault Suits.  Jake is one such pilot, drafted into the Pacific States' Marine Corp under the Federation. During his training, the war has grown substantially and upon being assigned to a platoon, he is immediately thrown into combat.

Cybernator is a side scrolling mech combat game and platform game. The player controls Jake as he moves his assault suit left and right on the battlefield. The assault suit can jump and use a jetpack for a short time to increase altitude. The assault suit begins with a Shot machine gun weapon that spreads out fire in front, and a Punch weapon for close melee. Additional weapons can be found during the course of the game and existing weapons improved by the gathering of "P" power-ups, left by defeated enemy. Each level contains a variety of enemies and an end boss which must be destroyed to reach the next level. Some levels take place as horizontally scrolling shooters, in which the Assault suit can move up, down, left and right on the screen... but is constantly advancing towards new threats.</desc>

The king sends his best troops of knights and wizards to face the enemy, but in vain - the kingdom is conquered by Sauzer, the king is murdered, and his lovely daughter is kidnapped. You were brave, Leader of the Dragon Squad, but now you will have to become strong. Remember the promise you gave the princess long time ago: always to be at her side. Supported by his friends and by his faithful dragons, you must now free the princess and the kingdom from the enemy's hands. If only the strongest of the dragons, Bahamut, could be awakened...

Bahamut Lagoon, created by the company which gave us the Final Fantasy games, is a mixture of turn-based strategy and RPG. Control several parties of four characters each, and command different dragons at once. The battles start on a top-down screen typical for strategy games, but often switch to a dynamic "platform" view, such as used in early console RPGs. You also can influence the game by other strategic activities, such as, for example, setting a whole forest on fire, to prevent enemies to come through it.</desc>

	<name>Bakutou Dochers</name>
	<desc>Bakutou Dodgers is a Japan-only action game for up to four players. It superficially resembles Hudson's Bomberman series, with its top-down grid stages and chaotic gameplay, but rather than leaving bombs and waiting for them to explode, the player can shoot energy at blocks and each other.

The goal is to sneak up behind the opponent and shoot them before they can reciprocate. Various power-ups may appear after destructible blocks are removed, which can give the player an edge or, in the case of the ? icon, a possible random negative effect like reversed controls. There are also wandering monsters that can cause damage to anyone they come in contact with. Every combatant has a health bar which depletes at a rate dependent on the attacks they are getting hit by.

The single-player mode involves fighting through various worlds and removing all enemy combatants from the field to progress.</desc>

	<desc>In this game, you're either in the foreground or the background, and your opponent is always on the opposite end of the screen. To fight whoever flies thar yonder in the distance, you send out projectiles, in our case fireballs. These behave differently depending on which of the four main buttons you press: if you press the A button, they fly in a curve towards the upper right part of the screen, if you push the Y button, they go left and down and so on and so forth. Sadly, they move so slowly your opponent has a good three seconds to get out of the way, and in so weird curves that aiming is impossible. Also, the screen constantly twists in all directions.</desc>

	<name>Battle Jockey</name>
	<desc>Battle Jockey is a racing game for up to four players that was developed by Nova and published by Virgin Interactive exclusively in Japan for the Super Famicom.It features horseracing, a far more popular pastime in Japan than elsewhere, and presents three separate modes: the first is the standard single-player story mode, in which the player takes a horse and jockey through training and races; the second is a battle mode which pits up to four players against each other in races that have far more power-ups and other unusual additions to the game's courses; and the third is a passive gambling mode in which the player puts money down on horses depending on their odds of winning and subsequent payouts and then watches the race play out with CPU players.The standard mode involves carefully managing the horse's stamina: being too aggressive will cause it to rear up in protest. Falling behind or running into a hedge or jump will cause the horse to lose stamina, and losing all stamina causes it to collapse briefly. The player needs to keep a steady pace, steer carefully around corners, jump at the right times and use the boost sparingly in order to win. In the battle mode stamina is less of a concern and the game more resembles RC Pro-Am: the players have to simply follow the course and avoid the dangers as they show up.</desc>

	<path>./Bishoujo Senshi Sailor Moon - Another Story (Japan) (Translated En).smc</path>
	<name>Sailor Moon : Another Story</name>
	<desc>The game is based on the Japanese manga and animé series Bishoujo Senshi: Sailor Moon - "Bishoujo Senshi" roughly meaning "Pretty Young Girl Warrior". It is set in the 30th century, in a futuristic city Crystal Tokyo. In this city lives a totally ordinary (at first) fourteen-year old girl Usagi. When she meets a magical cat named Luna, she finds out that she is in fact a princess sent to the future in order to fight the minions of Darkness. She discovers within herself the power to transform into the hero of darkness, Sailor Moon, meets other warriors who help her on her quest, and fights the evil Queen Beryl, hostile aliens, and other foes.

The events of this game take place shortly after Bishoujo Senshi Sailor Moon S, the fourth volume of the long-running series. A global peace is established in the universe, but lately suspicious things are happening. A strange meteorite is seen approaching the Earth. Street gangs and spies who work for a mysterious person called Apsu are seen in Crystal Tokyo. And the Mystic Silver Crystal, the Ginzuishou, which protects the city, is shaking! Usagi and her friends must now investigate the strange events and face the forces of Darkness once again.

The game is a console-style RPG in Final Fantasy style (battles with your party to the right and the enemies to the left), with a battle system somewhat similar to that of Chrono Trigger: you must form a party out of several available characters, make them participate in battles together, and learn powerful combo attacks.

Luna, a magical talking cat, contacts her and tells her she is in fact a Sailor Moon, one of the legendary Pretty Fighters - girls who fight the forces of darkness and protect the Kingdom of Moon. 

The game is based on the events of the animé that follow the victory of Usagi and her friends over the Queen Beryl. Peace has returned to the Moon Kingdom. But suddenly, a little girl named Chibiusa arrives from the future and says the future kingdom is threatened by the forces of the evil Prince Diamond. Looks like you are the only ones who can defeat him, and save the future Sailor Moon, Chibiusa's mother.

This is a beat-'em up game. You can play as either Usagi or any of her girlfriends, including Chibiusa. You move on a platform and fight the enemies by punching, kicking, and throwing them, and by using special abilities unique to each character. You can advance only after you have cleared an area from enemies.

The player is presented with a board filled with colored blocks in three colors: red, blue and green. The goal is to remove all the blocks from play. Clicking on a block that touches several adjacent blocks of the same color will remove them all from play. As each player successfully clears blocks, they drop "black blocks" on their opponent as well as increase their power bar. Black blocks cannot be removed by normal means and disappear only when large ammounts of blocks are removed adjacent to them. As the power bar charges, players can unleash their special ability, often an attack on the other player.

This puzzle game is based on the "S" series of Sailor Moon and includes characters from there: Sailor Moon, Sailor Mars, Sailor Venus, Sailor Mercury, Sailor Jupiter, Chibiusa, Tuxedo Mask, Sailor Uranus, Sailor Neptune and Sailor Pluto.

	<name>Sailor Moon S : Kurukkurin</name>
	<desc>Bishoujo Senshi Sailor Moon S: Kurukkurin is a competitive puzzle game featuring Sailor Moon licensed characters. Upon choosing a character (each with unique "special moves"), the player competes against an opponent. Each player controls a grid of 10x6 sections (represented by hearts) initially made up of clear hearts. The player moves their cursor over the clear hearts to turn them into one of four colors: red, yellow, blue and green. Sometimes "treasures" will show up on the board. When several hearts of the same color are adjacent to one another, the player can clear them... which pushes all the hearts (and treasures) down towards the bottom. The goal is to be the player with the most treasures to end the round.

Sailor Moon characters featured are primarily from the "S" Series and includes: Sailor Moon, Sailor Mars, Sailor Mercury, Sailor Venus, Sailor Jupiter, Chibius, Tuxedo Mask, Sailor Neptune, Sailor Uranus and Sailor Pluto.

	<name>Bishoujo Senshi Sailor Moon Super S - Zenin Sanka!! Shuyaku Soudatsusen</name>
	<desc>The game is based on the manga/animÃ© series Sailor Moon. It tells the story of Pretty Sailor Fighters, teenage girls who were summoned to protect the futuristic Moon Kingdom and to fight the forces of darkness, led by the evil Queen Beryl and Prince Diamond. The main heroine is a girl named Tsukino Usagi, who was contacted by the magical talking cat Luna to become Sailor Moon, the leader of the group.

This fighting game is an enhanced version of Bishoujo Senshi Sailor Moon S: Jougai Ranto!? Shuyaku Soudatsusen. Girls compete against each other in tournament mode, story mode, player-vs.-computer mode, and two players mode. They can use physical attacks and magical spells. In story mode you can also upgrade your fighter's attributes (strength, defense power, etc.) New in this expanded version: additional playable characters (hence the title Zen'in Sanka - "Everyone Participates"), different scenes in story mode, additional backgrounds for battles.

	<name>Brandish 2 : The Planet Buster</name>
	<desc>The Planet Buster continues the story that was told in the first Brandish game, and depicts the events that happened three years after the evil demonic king was defeated in his lost kingdom, sunken deep underground. You take control of a young warrior named Ares, who wields a magical weapon, a powerful sword called the Planet Buster. One day, while traveling through a desert, Ares is captured by a warlock named Karl, who is after the powers hidden within the magical sword. Suspecting Ares might have some valuable information, Karl doesn't execute him, but takes away the Planet Buster and throws Ares into his underground prison. Now your primary goal is to guide Ares out of the huge prison full of various dangers, and to get your mighty weapon back.

The game is an action RPG with a heavy emphasis on dungeon crawling. You guide Ares through rotating dungeons, fighting enemies in real-time combat, casting spells, and solving an occasional puzzle. You have the ability to jump forwards and to attack inanimate objects such as doors to cause damage and to break the object.

It is the third game in the series, and the first for the Super Nintendo.

The game follows the story of the manga to some extent.Besides the obvious graphical upgrade moving from 8-bit to 16-bit, Koutei no Chousen now allows the player to see a map of the pitch to help them strategize.</desc>

	<name>Captain Tsubasa J</name>
	<desc>A 1995 Japan-exclusive Captain Tsubasa video game developed and published by Bandai and was the final Captain Tsubasa game for the Super Famicom.
This game suffered lots of changes from previous games made by Tecmo, this time you will be playing in a real soccer field and in real time, which means that you need to press certain keys even without having the chance of stopping the time (like in previous games), When a certain player is confronted with a one that he considers his rival (like Misugi and Schneider or Tsubasa and *any other player*, for example) they will have a fight, which is mainly a button smashing sequence. The same goes for the sequence in which a goalkeeper tries to stop any of the special shots.
This game has almost the same story as the Captain Tsubasa J anime, except that this one will finish with a special match against an extra team. So, you'll play across various chapters, playing with Aoi Shingo in Italy or controlling the mythic Ozora Tsubasa in his match against the brazillian prodigy, Carlos Santana (nope, he isn't the singer). You'll also play with Japan national team against the same opponents as they did in the anime version..</desc>

Starship Hector).All three of these games were the subjects of the Hudson All-Japan Caravan Festival, which for a long time hosted a new Hudson shoot 'em up every year and traveled around Japan with competitors in different prefectures attempting to earn the highest scores. The game would then be available for sale shortly before or after the competition, which helped raise its profile.</desc>

	<desc>CB Chara Wars, sometimes written with the subtitle Ushinawareta Gag, is an RPG that features a crossover of sorts of Go Nagai's various manga franchises. These include Devilman and Mazinger Z, among others. The "CB" in the title refers to the term "chibi", which depicts characters as smaller and cuter than usual. In that sense, it is similar to the term SD (super deformation) found in several Super Famicokm Gundam game titles.CB Chara Wars began as an original video animation which first aired in 1991. A manga adaptation followed the following year, as did this game. Banpresto published the game in Japan, a company known for creating games with anime crossovers such as the Super Robot Taisen/Wars series.</desc>

	<name>Chinhai</name>
	<desc>Chinhai is a puzzle game for the Super Famicom and a variant on Mahjong Solitaire, or Shanghai. Instead of pairing and removing any two tiles that match as long as one of their sides is clear, as is the case in Shanghai, the rules of Chinhai require that the two tiles can only be removed if it's possible to draw a line between the two that doesn't make a 90 degree turn more than twice. Two tiles on opposite sides of the board, for instance, can't be paired because it would take three 90 degree turns to draw a line between them. To account for this added difficulty, the game lacks the "stacks" of tiles that frequently appear in Shanghai, instead presenting a flat board of tiles.Chinhai is named for the municipality of Chinhai in China, maintaining the theme of naming mahjong solitaire variants after territories in China. Chinhai has long since been renamed Zhenhai, which is situated in the Ningpo Prefecture and now part of a much larger city. This mahjong solitaire variant is perhaps best known as Sichuan or Shisenshou, also named for a province in China.</desc>

	<desc>The Cho Aniki series makes it's debut on the SNES with all of it's homo-erotic, pseudo humorous, bizarre, sweaty bodybuilding charm, but with one major gameplay change. Instead of being another side-scrolling shooter, Bakuretsu Rantouden is actually a one-on-one 2D fighter a la Street Fighter in which the most recognizable characters from the Cho Aniki series (yes the speedo wearing bodybuilders included) fight each other for ultimate supremacy using special attacks and moves.

An interesting feature is that the game honors it's shooter roots, therefore instead of being restricted to walking backwards and forwards in the 2D plane and jumping around as in other fighting games, in this game all the characters can fly meaning the fights actually occur in mid-air allowing the players to dash all over the screen. Includes single player and 2-player vs modes.

	<desc>?In this sidescrolling action-platformer, Bonk is once again trying to save his world from the evil clutches of the reptilian king, who once more is threatening the prehistoric era.  Boy, you'd think that after being defeated four times prior that he would take a hint.  This time, you also get to face his five best soldiers, who will try to stop you in your tracks.  Bonk controls rather smoothly, and he is really fun to control.  To those of you that are not familiar with the series, Bonk is a caveman who attacks his enemies with his noggin; after jumping down, from below, while swimming, and while in the air.  He can even bounce off walls with his head, skip on the water like a stone if his head is facing down, climb certain walls with his teeth, scale up waterfalls, flip in the air (so long as the attack button is repeatedly being tapped), and so forth.  As is the case with the series, you start with a regular amount of health, but if you find a translucent heart icon, you'll increase your capacity.  What's neat is how collecting the food not only scores you some points but how it also replenishes a little bit of your health, too.  This time Bonk can also run if you hold down the A button, and the X button is used if you have a special ability on you.  If you find a power-up, whether it be piece of meat, or a different icon, then you will be given a power-up ability that will be taken out the moment you're hit once (damn).  Among the power-ups are the one where the fire will be spreading if Bonk hits his head on the ground (you know, the one where he looks freaky), one where Bonk turns into a bird and gains the ability to fly, one where Bonk becomes tiny and can make platforms made out of Japanese characters, and there is one where Bonk has the ability to double-jump as a girl.  Yes, Bonk becomes a girl if he eats the pink-colored meat.  I'm dead serious.</desc>

	<name>Choujikuu Yousai Macross : Scrambled Valkyrie</name>
	<desc>The legend of the Valkyrie pilots is not yet over. Hikaru, Max, and Millia take flight to defend the earth from Zentraedi, robots, more robots, and giant space crab-bees. Now is the time to scramble Valkyrie again. 

When starting a game or continuing the player picks from either Hikaru, Max, or Millia. Each flies a custom Valkyrie with its own set weapon load-out. A Valkyrie changes its weapon and movement speed by switching between its three forms: Fighter, Gerwalk, and Battroid. Typically the Valkyrie weapon shoots straight and quickly, the Gerwalk weapon shoots around or through obstacles, and the Battroid weapon does higher damage in exchange for reduced firing rate. Each weapon can be upgraded up to twice by picking up power up items dropped by special enemy ships, but one level of power up will be lost any time the Valkyrie is shot. If a Valkyrie's entire life bar is depleted then the full stage must be repeated, provided the player still has enough continues.

In a nod to Galaga the player is able to capture some enemy craft to increase their firepower. If the player does not shoot any weapons for a few seconds a field of electricity will cover the Valkyrie. Touching some enemy ships will then cause their targeting to be shorted out and make them friendly to the player, following along and shooting or ramming onscreen enemies.

	<name>Chou Mahou Tairiku Wozz </name>
	<desc>The magic world of Wozz, populated by magicians, alchemists, and other kinds of people - including simple town and village inhabitants - was a seemingly peaceful place, until one day, a poisonous rain started turning its inhabitants into monsters. The chief wizard realizes that the demon Balaam is trying to link the world of Wozz with the world of humans. Only a human hero can stop Balaam, and the wizard's teleporting magic brings... three young humans: the Japanese girl Reona Kitazato, and two boys: the American Shot Phoenix and the Chinese Chun Chingtao. Will those youngsters be able to stop Balaam?

The game is a traditional console-style RPG similar to Breath of Fire: turn-based battles are viewed from an isometric perspective. You control all three characters as a party, but in the beginning of the game you choose one of them as the main character, and therefore will see the game from his/her perspective. In case the characters split up, you'll be able to control only the one you chose.

	<name>Cosmo Gang - The Puzzle</name>
	<desc>Cosmo Gang: The Puzzle is a puzzle game from Namco and the second game to feature their Cosmo Gang characters. The Cosmo Gang were originally attached to a group of redemption games (like pachinko or claw machines) from Namco, but would eventually star in two Arcade games: Cosmo Gang: The Video, a Galaga clone, and Cosmo Gang: The Puzzle.

This game would become the basis of Namco's more well-known puzzle game Pac-Attack, featuring Pac-Man. As with Pac-Attack, the idea is to stack up a lot of the animated face icons (members of the Cosmo Gang) in an unbroken chain and then drop a bomb (shaped like an arrow) that goes down the chain and eliminates them all at once.</desc>

The Cosmo Gang are based on a series of characters that had previously been used by Namco for a redemption game (a type of Arcade machine that dispenses award tokens for winning a rudimentary game, of which pachinko is the most popular variant) the previous year. The subtitle suggests that this is their video game debut. Originally released in the Arcades, Cosmo Gang: The Video was later ported to the Super Famicom.</desc>

	<desc>Once again the universe is at peril from invaders from beyond, but this time their target is Earth! Galivan and company don't have time to find items or level up weapons as in Galivan's previous outing; this is a no holds barred slugfest. Three characters are playable, each with varying stats but basically the same moveset. Each character has a standard straight ahead punch or kick, a sweeping kick, an uppercut, and a ranged attack that must be charged up. At the start of the game and the end of every level the player can add stat points to their character to increase their HP, defense, jump height, and strength of normal and special attacks.

A 2 player versus mode is included as well. Both players can choose from the three main characters, and the second player can additionally choose from one of the four normal enemy types.</desc>

	<name>Crayon Shin Chan</name>
	<desc>Five-year-old Shinnosuke Nohara is the epitome of noisy children: loud and inappropriate, infuriating to his parents, and hilarious to onlookers. Shin-chan is always getting in trouble with his parents and saying bizarre or offensive things to everyone he meets. Every so often, though, he'll try to do what his mom wants him to, but more often than not, he'll misunderstand and simply confound his parents further.

Arashi o Yobu Enji ("A Kindergartner Called Tempest") is one of many games based on the manga and anime created by Yoshito Usui. In four stages, each made up of five areas, Shin-chan must explore his neighborhood looking for a specific object. He can enter houses to ask people for information, but will often end up simply insulting them. He must also avoid or knock over the other children in the neighborhood, and has various ability cards that he can use to assist him, which might give him a water pistol or refill his health. After finding what he's looking for, Shin-chan will move on to the next area.

Also included is a minigame mode with eight different minigames, such as a bubble-blowing contest, a three-legged race, and a desperate search for clothing before school. The entire game, including the minigames, is filled with dialogue containing the same humor as the source material.

	<desc>Crayon Shin-Chan 2: Dai Maou no Gyakushu ("Crayon Shin-Chan 2: The Demon Lord's Counterattack") is a platformer based on the Crayon Shin-Chan anime and manga. The player, as the mischievous kindergartner Shin-chan, must rescue his favorite super hero Action Kamen ("Action Mask") from his prison before Action Kamen's supervillain nemesis Haiguremaou can take over both Action Kamen's and Shin-chan's worlds. Many of the bosses are transformed versions of Shin-chan's friends and family.

The game is a standard side-scrolling 2D platformer - common with licensed games - though it is notable for letting players decide which order they want to tackle stages, not to mention the franchise's penchant for weird/gross-out humor.</desc>

	<desc>There was once a prosperous kingdom, a peaceful kingdom, ruled by a wise old king, where all peopled lived happily together, protected by the power of a magical crystal. But one day, several dark clouds appeared over the kingdom and poured down a devastating rain. And then one of the clouds turned into a demon, and, reaching its hands to the treasure room in the palace, took the crystal away. The demon lord, still in a form of a menacing dark cloud, started spawning monsters and sending them to attack the now helpless kingdom. The king called to the heavens for help. Eight magical weapons fell on the ground, and eight warriors rose to protect their country. Your task now is to cleanse the land of the monsters and to defeat the evil demon lord.

"Crystal Beans" is an action RPG based on fighting and dungeon crawling. You can play as either of the eight initial character classes: Fighter, Warrior, Bow-man, Wizard, Priest, Kage (a kind of a ninja), Monk, or Witch. In addition, there are four secret classes you discover during your journey. Each class has its own strength and weaknesses, and two unique attack types.</desc>

	<name>Cu-On-Pa SFC</name>
	<desc>Cu-On-Pa SFC is the Super Famicom version of Cu-On-Pa.Cu-On-Pa is an original puzzle game that was developed by a little-known group called Onesong Partners. This group originally released an obscure game similar to this but with a wider audience in mind, various enhancements and alternate modes for PCs called "Endorfun" in 1995 in the U.S and Europe.Japanese developers seemed to like the concept and got permission to make something like it based on the original principals of Endorfun for the obscure Satellaview (or BS-X) and then later as a standalone release for the Super Famicom, where the game was called BS Cu-On-Pa and Cu-On-Pa, respectively. It would also get released later for Playstation.Published by T&amp;E Soft for the SFC late in 1996, Cu-On-Pa was also fan-translated sometime later for the emulation community, though the game comes with a rather straightforward tutorial and the game is very easy to understand, but difficult to master. This game is difficult to describe and in a league of its own.You play as a three-dimensional cube that must destroy all the "Life Panels" on a level. To do so, you have to rotate your cube and roll over the colored squares on the transparent field. Panels come in a variety of colors and the main way to elimate them is by having the color on the top of the cube match the color of the tile beneath you.The other way is for more skilled players and comes in the form of "Lightning Panels", which are generated when you destroy panels other than Life Panels. Destroy enough of them and you'll have lots of them. Then go and destroy a life panel! What will happen is, all lightning panels will explode that match the color of the life panel you rolled over. Moreover, the explosion spreads and detonates other tiles in the vicinity, which can spread and create a chain reaction. It's up to you how you wish to rack up points, either by time, chains, or both.Ken Kojima was the music composer.</desc>

	<name>Cyber Knight</name>
	<desc>In the 24th century, mankind has gone into space. The crew of the starship Swordfish are in an engagement with space pirates when the battle takes a turn for the worse. In desperation, the crew activate their jump drive without a destination... and end up flung across the galaxy to the galactic core. The Swordfish however is badly damaged with many casualties including the captain. Only 26 of the crew survive, and of them only 6 are qualified for combat: The commander, two soldiers, a mechanic and a doctor and six giant "Module" mechanized suits available for them. These survivors locate planet Farworld, apparently colonized by humans. There they discover the colony is under attack by a relentless mechanical aliens dubbed "Berserkers". The crew of the swordfish must fight back against the Berserkers and explore the galaxy for some means to return home.

Cyber Knight is an RPG with a science-fiction theme of being lost in an alien galaxy. The game takes place in a top-down view for movement on planets and areas, a side-view for combat sequences and a first person menu system when aboard the Swordfish starship. The Swordfish can travel between stars, scanning worlds for information. If the ship is able to land on a planet, three crew members piloting three Modules (giant robots) can be selected to debark and explore the planet. Many planets will have towns or people living on them which can be talked to in order to uncover information. Different quests are assigned in order to find the items necessary to progress. There is no system of currency or buying items. Instead, many defeated Berserkers leave behind "NeoParts", which can be brought back to the Swordfish's lab. Analysis of these Neo parts unlocks enhances statistics (endurance, agility, accuracy, etc) for the Modules and new weapons for them to carry. The six modules are unique in statistics, and also the six pilots each carry different skills.

Combat takes place in turn-based combat on a 6x6 squares field. Seen from the side view, the three modules can be positioned in relation to enemies in order to attack, using a variety of melee and long-ranged weaponry. Ammunition is unlimited, but each module also carries a number of "options" that are consumable attacks. Each Module has two sets of hitpoints: one for the pilot and one for the module itself. If either one of these reaches zero, the module is destroyed. In order to heal, the party carries 10 each of repair kits and first aid kits, which must when not in combat. These kits, as well as options and defeated pilots or modules can be restored by returning to the Swordfish.</desc>

	<desc>Following the events of the first Cyber Knight in the 24th century, the crew of the Swordfish have returned to Earth after defeating the mechanical "Berzerkers" far across space. However during their time away, the Earth Federation has been taken over by the ambitious General Forrest, who seeks to wage war on the independent systems and conquer them. Recognizing the potential weapons that could be made from the Berzerker science data, Forrest impounds the Swordfish and jails it's crew. The Berzerker data is used to create "Overtech" and bring to life "Metalliforms", self-replicating war machines. The Swordfish crew manages to escape, thanks to a mysterious agent "CJ", and are recruited into the resistance against the Earth Federation. Given a new spaceship, the Galvodirge, they must travel the galaxy to different human civilizations and devise a plan to stop Earth's attack.

Cyber Knight II is an RPG with science-fiction themes. As in the first game, much of the game takes place in a top-down view for movement on planets and areas, a side-view for combat sequences and a first person menu system when aboard the Galvodirge starship. The Galvodirge can travel between stars, scanning worlds for information. If the ship is able to land on a planet, the crew can debark either on foot or using combat modules (mechs). Some areas are only accessible using modules and others (such as towns) do not allow the use of these war machines. Many planets will have towns or people living on them which can be talked to in order to uncover information. Different quests are assigned in order to find the items necessary to progress. There is no system of currency or buying items. Instead, many defeated enemies leave behind "NeoParts", which can be brought back to the Swordfish's lab. Analysis of these Neo parts unlocks enhances statistics (endurance, agility, accuracy, etc) for the Modules and new weapons for them to carry. 

The crew are divided into a three person "combat team" and a three person "support team". If modules are used, they can be assigned from the ship's hanger. Unlike the first game, modules only perform a combat or a support role, and each is unique in statistics and the type of weaponry it can carry. When combat occurs on the main map, the support team will often deliver the first strike by firing missiles into the enemies. When searching facilities, caves or other locations, the support team is not available. Following either case, the combat team engages the enemy in turn-based combat on a 6x6 squares field. Seen from the side view, the three modules can be positioned in relation to enemies in order to attack, using a variety of melee and long-ranged weaponry. Ammunition is unlimited, but each module also carries a number of "options" that are consumable attacks. Each Module has two sets of hitpoints: one for the pilot and one for the module itself. If either one of these reaches zero, the module is destroyed. In order to heal, the party carries 10 each of repair kits and first aid kits, which must when not in combat. These kits, as well as options and defeated pilots or modules can be restored by returning to the Galvodirge.</desc>

	<desc>Nine young people were turned into cyborgs by a company trying to take over the world. They have defeated this company and are now using their super powers to protect the world.

Based on the manga/anime by the same name, Cyborg 009 is a side-scrolling platformer in which the player takes control of 8 different cyborgs, using their special abilities to complete several missions. 

Their special abilities are as follows:
002 can fly and hover in the air; 003 can see in the dark; 004 can fire bullets from his fingers and rockets from his knees; 005 can break rocks with his fists; 006 can blow fire that also melts rocks; 007 can take on different shapes including those of enemies; 008 can swim underwater for extended periods of time; 009 can move at very high speeds. (001 is a baby and can't be taken on missions). Using these special abilities consumes SP that slowly regenerate. 

In addition to their special abilities, the cyborgs also have four attributes that govern their attack and defensive powers, their amount of SP and SP regeneration speed. 

Before every mission, one cyborg is assigned leader and two more can be selected by the player. Only one cyborg can be controlled at a time, but it is possible to switch between cyborgs at any time. All cyborgs share the same HP and SP-bar. Throughout the levels, experience points can be collected and used to increase a cyborg's attributes after a completed mission.</desc>

	<name>Dark Half</name>
	<desc>Through the Light came the Darkness, and through the Darkness came the Light. They were inseparable in the beginning, and gave birth to each other. Rukyu appeared before all the other creatures, the great demon of darkness, later to be known as the Satan. The divine hero-god Roda went up to his dark realm to defeat him, but was struck down, and presumed dead. But the hero couldn't die so easily: he swore to defeat Rukyu once and for all. Meanwhile, Rukyu doesn't just stay in his realm, waiting for Roda: he goes out to the world as a death-bringing sorcerer, and he is out for Roda...

The game is quite different from most other RPGs, because it lets you play as both the "good" hero and the villain. The game is divided into chapters, and each chapter is played by either Roda or Rukyu. You switch the two heroes chapter-after-chapter, and lead them to their ultimate battle from two opposite sides. The entire game, including the battles, is viewed from an isometric perspective. The battles are random and turn-based, and the battle field is divided into squares you can position and move your characters on. Both Roda and Rukyu can have party members join them, and both attack mostly with magic. Rukyu uses a special energy called "Soul Power", while Roda cast one-time spells from scrolls he receives after battles.</desc>

	<name>Dark Law: The Meaning of Death</name>
	<desc>Three-hundred years ago, there were two kingdoms on the earth -Reyfore, ruled by the benevolent and mighty king Reynard, and Amugnon, ruled by king Daruk. The two kingdoms could have lived in peace, but pride took over king Daruk, he didn't respect the Goddess any more, and as a result his mind became obsessed by the idea of destruction. Daruk attacked Reyfore, and for decades war was embracing the two kingdoms, setting the Earth in flames. After a prolonged battle, king Reynard defeated king Daruk, and a reign of prosperity began once again.

But can evil be truly defeated? The hero of the game, a young adventurer, falls down from a cliff while taking a stroll near the ancient Sophia Temple. He is saved by an old man who lives with his daughter Refia in a small country house. But one day, a demonic-looking knight appears, accompanied by monsters, kills the old man, and kidnaps Refia. The old man recognized the knight - it was king Daruk! Now the hero must bring Refia back and defeat Daruk once and for all.

The game has a less linear structure than a standard console-style RPG: together with the main story there are many missions, or "scenarios", which are not obligatory to complete, but which occupy a large portion of the game. In the beginning of the game you create a party of four characters, the hero and his three companions. The battles are pre-determined and take place on the same screen as the gameworld itself. Your party and the enemies can move freely around the screen and attack with melee and ranged weapons, and their actions depend on the amount of action points they have. Navigation in town is menu-based.</desc>

	<desc>Dear Boys is a 1994 Super Famicom basketball game based on the manga of the same name. The game features both a story mode, which follows the plot of the manga, and an exhibition mode that allows the player to go straight into a match.

The game features a "dramatic" perspective that is also slightly turn-based, similar to the Captain Tsubasa games. A window demonstrates what is happening - a ball is passed, a shot is thrown, the tip-off - in dramatic comic book style that is reminiscent of the manga. While a player's athlete has the ball, the player can pull up a menu that allows them to choose to pass, shoot or look at the present characters stats - each character has their own strengths and weaknesses that the player should keep in mind.</desc>

	<name>Dharma Doujou</name>
	<desc>Dharma Doujou was originally released in the arcades by Metro3D in 1994 (picture on the left). While the original version provides the same gameplay as the Super Famicom version tested here, the game does have some noticeable differences. First of all, it has more enemies and features colorful backgrounds borrowed from traditional Japanese themes and myths (well, in the Korean version of the game, Metro3D apparently threw in a couple of bikini girls for good measure). Additionally, the arcade game only contains a story mode and there is no progress map or alternate game modes like in the Super Famicom port. But, most importantly, the gameplay is slightly different - the player has to move the character around the screen in order to hit a block with the mallet. The Super Famicon version, on the contrary, automatically aligns the player with the furthest most block, and this apparently minor difference makes the gameplay of the home conversion more fast-paced and enjoyable than the original.</desc>

	<path>./Doraemon - Nobita to Yousei no Kuni (Japan).smc</path>
	<name>Doraemon</name>
	<desc>The game is based on the animé series "Doraemon". Doraemon is a blue robotic cat who has the ability to enter dream world and to help the people who live there. In this game, Nobita, a bespectacled friend of Doraemon's, suddenly meets a little fairy. Long ago, humans and fairies lived together in peace, but since the humans started developing their technology, the fairies have no place any more. Nobita and Doraemon travel to the dream world to find out how can they help.

The game is divided into adventure and platform action modes. In adventure mode, you navigate Doraemon from a top-down view, talking to people and entering houses. When you have gathered enough information, a place on the map will be highlighted. If Doraemon (or other characters, later in the game) enters this place, a platform action section begins. In platform mode, Doraemon must overcome the obstacles and defeat enemies by jumping on them or by throwing magic dusk at them, in order to retrieve important items.

	<name>Doraemon 2</name>
	<desc>The game is closely related to Doraemon: Nobita to Yosei no Kuni. It is based on the manga "Doraemon", that tells the story of a Japanese boy named Nobita, who always gets bullied by stronger kids in the school. In the future, his grandson uses a time machine and send the cat-like robot Doraemon to protect Nobita. In this adventure, Nobita, Doraemon, and their friends travel to the Toys Land. Some evil toys are threatening this country, and it's up to our heroes to help its inhabitants.

The game is divided into adventure and platform action modes. In adventure mode, Doraemon walks around towns, talking to people and entering houses. Key locations lead to platform levels, which must be completed to advance the story. Platform levels include plenty of obstacles (pits, spikes, self-destructing platforms etc.), as well as various enemies who try to stop the heroes. You can choose one of the six available characters to play through the platform level. They all can jump and defeat enemies either by jumping on their heads or by using long-ranged weapons.

	<desc>The game is based on the popular manga series Doraemon. It tells the story of a Japanese boy named Nobita, who often gets beaten by other boys. Nobita's future grandson constructs a cat-like blue robot named Doraemon, and sends him to the past to protect Nobita. In this game, a friend of Nobita's finds a fossil. Accidentally, this fossil gets overrun by a car. Nobita feels it was his fault and asks Doraemon to use a time machine to travel back to prehistoric age to retrieve the fossil. 

This is an action platform game with adventure elements. You can control Doraemon, Nobita, and other characters, traveling through platform levels, defeating or avoiding enemies. Each character has his own weapon and possesses a special ability (for example, Suneo can crawl through narrow spaces, etc.) which is often required to complete a stage. In present time, you travel through Nobita's town in top down view, talking to characters and entering houses. There is also a slight RPG element in the game, as you can buy items and upgrade your weapons.

This is a platform action game that is somewhat similar to Super Mario World. You travel on a world map and enter various platform locations. Before each level, you can choose to play as either Doraemon, Nobita, or other four available characters. You can jump on enemies' heads or shoot at them with various weapons to eliminate them. There are many items and upgrades scattered around the levels, and sometimes it is possible to power-up by using two characters simultaneously.

	<name>Do Re Mi Fantasy: Milon no DokiDoki Daibouken</name>
	<desc>A young boy named Milon sets off to save Alis, his fairy friend, after she was captured by the evil sorcerer Amon. He later learns that the only way to defeat Amon is by collecting five legendary instruments which Amon has stolen.  The sorcerer placed a curse on these instruments so that their true powers cannot be used and then left them in the hands of his minions.  The only way to lift the curse is by collecting five stars.

Armed with only his bubble shooter, Milon must retrieve the legendary instruments, lift their curses and use their powers to defeat Amon and rescue Alis.

Traveling through many different worlds starting with the forest, Milon will be confronted by many enemies. Milon can either shoot bubbles to trap and send his enemies away, or he can jump and flatten his enemies temporarily turning them into a platform for him to walk across. 

Milon has three different "outfits": red, blue, and green. With the green outfit, Milon can withstand three hits. Each time he gets hit, he will be downgraded a color - green to blue, blue to red. If he gets hit with the red outfit, he will die and have to start the level over.

By collecting 100 music notes, Milon will get an extra life. There are also other useful items to get like bubble gum that will save Milon once if he were to fall, a special bubble shooter that let's him shoot multiple bubbles at once and a star that makes Milon temporarily invincible so that he can defeat enemies simply by running at them.</desc>

	<name>Dossun ! Ganseki Battle</name>
	<desc>A falling block puzzle game  in a pseudo-medieval fantasy setting that pits two characters against each other in an abstract form of combat that is quite similar to games like Columns. Combining at least three matching symbols in a vertical, horizontal or diagonal line does not only clear them off the screen, but also deals damage to an opponent. This means that players do not only have to keep their game area clear, but also pay attention to their characters health bar. Once a block touches the top of the screen or the health bar is diminished the game ends.

There are four different icons that have different effects when combined:
Books, swords and rocks deal damage to an opponent by attacking with fireballs, dragons or swords.
Bottles heal a certain amount of health.
Purple blocks have no effect, but clog up the screen nonetheless.

Chain reactions result in particularly powerful attacks or place one or more grey blocks inside the opponents area. They can be destroyed just like ordinary blocks, but they always stay in the same spot and do not fall down.

More complex chain reactions give access to special attacks, up to three of which can be held and activated with the shoulder buttons. Special attacks have different effects that include clearing all purple blocks, using all potions and clearing the bottom three lines.

As expected of a Nekketsu game you can play it rough by sneaking punches and kicks to "bend" the rules a bit, you can also use the "ki" or willpower of your players to trigger special moves and strategic management is limited to specifying different base strategies and behaviors for each player.</desc>

	<name>Dragon Ball Z Super Gokuden : Kakusei Hen</name>
	<desc>This is a direct sequel to the  first "interactive fighter" for SNES, based on the popular manga/animé series Dragon Ball. The game picks up the story where it ended in the previous game, and continues through Piccolo, Saiyajin, and Freezer sagas of the manga. After the battle with the Demon King (Daimaou) Piccolo, the twenty-third World Martial Arts Tournament is about to begin. But to the amazement of the hero Son Goku and his friends, their archrival Piccolo appears during the tournament, so that it quickly turns into a genuine battle.

You control Son Goku and his son Son Gohan, switching between them as the game progresses. The game is basically an interactive comic book in which you can influence the story by choosing to press a button when the game prompts you to make a choice. You'll also participate in battles. The battle system is similar to rock-paper-scissors game, where one kind of move always beats or always loses to another. You can dash into your enemies, attack physically, and perform special moves, pressing the buttons in real time (although the battles are divided into turns).

	<path>./Dragon Ball Z - Super Saiya Densetsu (Japan) (Translated En).smc</path>
	<name>Dragon Ball Z : Legend of the Super Saiyan</name>
	<desc>Cho Saiya Densetsu is based on the popular manga/animé series Dragon Ball. It follows the events described in the beginning of Dragon Ball Z, the second story block, which tells about the connection of the hero Son Goku with a powerful alien race, and new mighty foes from far away planets. The game starts just where the tale of Dragon Ball begins. Son Goku goes to meet his friends, but is stopped by a mysterious stranger named Raditz who tells Son Goku they are relatives. Raditz demands from him to destroy humanity, and as Son Goku refuses, takes his son Son Gohan hostage. To rescue his son, Son Goku joins forces with his arch-rival, the Demon King Piccolo, who obviously has his own plans concerning Raditz. And thus begins the story during which Son Goku will learn of his true origin...

The game is a RPG similar to the card-based Dragon Ball Z RPGs for NES. During battles, you choose cards from your card inventory, which determine the nature and the strength of your characters' attacks. You can also train your characters in training houses and upgrade their special Ki power. Unlike early DBZ RPGs, you can move around freely in Cho Saiya Densetsu, and your movements are not determined by cards. You can also fly around the world and use your special Dragon Radar to discover location of magical Dragon Balls.

	<name>Dragon Quest I.II</name>
	<desc>This is a remake of two classic NES RPGs - an exclusively Japanese release of the two first Dragon Quest titles on one cartridge.

In Dragon Quest (known as Dragon Warrior in the US), you play as the descendant of the legendary warrior Erdrick, and your goal is to recover the magical Ball of Light from Erdrick's and the humanity's arch-enemy, the Dragon Lord. In Dragon Quest II, you assume the role of the descendant of the hero of the first game, and must join forces with two other characters in order to defeat a demon lord who destroyed a nearby city and killed its inhabitants. 

Both RPGs feature random battles and turn-based combat viewed from first-person perspective. In Dragon Quest you fight alone, while in the sequel two other characters can join your party, and you also fight against multiple enemies at once.

The remake includes updated graphics (although they still retain the original NES look), sound of SNES quality, and some changes in the gameplay and in the game world. Certain locations are larger, some menu commands (such as "Stairs") are omitted, and there is a larger variety of items.

	<name>Dragon Quest III</name>
	<desc>Dragon Warrior III is the concluding game of the first Dragon Quest/Dragon Warrior trilogy, and its story takes us back to the time period of the legendary Erdrick (also known as Loto), the ancestor of the first game's hero. You are the son of a powerful warrior Ortega, skillful in physical combat and spellcasting. Your father went out to fight the evil Baramos, who is responsible for the appearance of monsters in your region, and never returned. You are sent by the king on a quest to continue your father's brave deeds and to defeat Baramos.

Dragon Warrior III is a top-down role-playing game where you travel around the overworld, caves, castles, cities and other locations while battling random encounters, buying equipment, and talking to people. You and your party members receive experience when they beat up monsters and level up with enough experience, increasing their stats. The game features a day/night cycle - as you travel, day slowly changes to night and vice versa; shops are typically closed at night. 

You begin with control of just the main character but can quickly recruit three more members to your party. During the game you can choose to drop your current characters and recruit others at any time. The recruitable characters are divided into six classes: soldier, fighter, merchant, goof-off, pilgrim and wizard.

The game has a unique job system, giving you the ability to switch your hired characters' classes after they have achieved at least level 20 in their base class. Characters can switch to the other beginning classes, as well as the sage class, which is not available at the beginning. When a character switches classes, they lose all earned experience points, and half of their stats, but retain all of the abilities of the previous class. In this way, you can create powerful combination characters that are able to cast spells and fight effectively.

	<name>Dragon Quest V</name>
	<desc>You are the son of the brave warrior, Lord Papas. It appears that your mother died just after giving birth to you, and your father took you on a long journey when you were a little baby, and all you know is that he was searching for something. Now you are six years old, and Lord Papas brings you to your home village. After some time, you learn that His Highness Prince Henry was kidnapped by bandits. Your father attempts to rescue him, and during this action you discover that perhaps your mother is still alive... The game follows the story of Papas' son, and this story is stretched over years, as the hero grows and becomes a man of courage and virtue. During the game, the hero will discover the truth about his mother, and will have to make some crucial decisions, such as which girl to marry (the decisions affect the course of the game and its ending).

"Dragon Quest V" is a party RPG with turn-based combat, and battles viewed from 1st person perspective, just like all its predecessors. Your party roams about the world, fighting random enemies, performing quests, and defeating bosses. The novelty is in the game's unusual story, which spans almost a lifetime of the hero. 

"Dragon Quest V" was not available outside of Japan until 2009, when the DS version was released in the United States.

Was this just a dream? You have just fallen out of your bed dreaming! It's time to go to the village elder, to get a seemingly simple assignment - to sell some goods at a bazaar in the nearest town. But soon the hero will discover his dream was not so far away from reality...

"Dragon Quest VI" is the last SNES game of the Dragon Quest series (called "Dragon Warrior" in US). It is a party RPG with turn-based combat and battles viewed from 1st person perspective. Not much has changed since the NES days of Dragon Quest - gameplay style, setting, and even menu layout seem almost identical to those of the early classics. Like its immediate predecessor Dragon Quest V, this game was never released outside Japan.

	<desc>Long time ago, a flourishing civilization was destroyed by the rage of a mighty dragon. The Earth was set in flames, and no one escaped the destruction - no one except one man, who managed to launch himself forward, thousand years into the future. There, he was found by people of Kardosa Empire, who soon understood they have in their hands a human who possesses the secret of a superior ancient technology, that was unknown to the primitive civilization of the present...

You play the role of Aleth, the son of the High Priest in the small kingdom of Garade, whom leads a peaceful life with his friend Lagnus, Prince of Garade. One day Aleth accidentally gains possession of a precious artifact which is sought after by the Kardosa Empire. Aleth and Lagnus get involve in a conflict which will soon lead them to great discoveries of the secrets of the ancient civilization, of the great destruction that occurred thousand years ago, and of their own true identities...

The game is a console-style RPG: your party meets randomly encountered enemies and bosses, and fights them in turn-based combat viewed from isometric perspective. You upgrade armor by buying it, and also can buy weapons, but weapons can also be upgraded for money to different levels, to create powerful attacks called "techs".</desc>

	<desc>Dynamic Stadium is a baseball game from Eleca/Electronics Application released exclusively for the Super Famicom. While adopting the same behind-the-batter perspective as Namco's Famista series, Dynamic Stadium presents its athletes as comic book heroes rather than chibi figures, making them absurdly buff and frequently featuring action shots of them catching fly-balls and narrowly making it to base before being caught out. "Safe!" and "Out!" calls are presented as spiky word balloons.

Dynamic Stadium does not feature an official NPB license, so all the team names are fictitious. The game was published in Japan by Sammy Corporation and was never localized for overseas territories.</desc>

In Edo no Kiba you are always moving forward, either running or walking (or, in some levels, flying), although you can still move around the screen as in most belt-scrolling games. Your avatar attacks by slashing to the right with his energy sword, and he can also hold his sword defensively to deflect some bullets. By then holding forward and releasing attack he can throw the sword like a boomerang. He can also jump. A bomb follows the avatar around on any on-foot level that can be used to destroy all enemies onscreen at any time, and it will be replaced whenever a life is lost. Environments range from city streets to sewers and a flying battleship. Each level ends with a boss fight against an enemy that can withstand many attacks.</desc>

	<name>Emerald Dragon</name>
	<desc>In "Emerald Dragon", you play as Atrushan, a blue dragon who lives in the Dragon World. One day, he and his friends discover a ship wreck near a mountain. After examining the wreck, the dragons find a human child - a little girl. The wise White Dragon, the leader of the dragons, tells them that her name is Tamryn and that she will play an important role in their lives. The girl doesn't remember anything, and grows up together with the dragons. But when she turns fifteen, she decides to go back to her homeland - the Human World. Soon after Tamryn has left, Atrushan realizes he can't bear the separation, and asks the White Dragon to allow him to go and find Tamryn in the Human World. But a mysterious evil curse has been placed on the dragons - they can't appear among the humans in their true form. Atrushan agrees to become a human and goes to the Human World - to find Tamryn, and also a way to remove the curse...

The game features traditional Japanese-style RPG gameplay - Atrushan and his party travel over world map, visiting towns and descending into dungeons. The battle system is somewhat unusual - you can control only Atrushan, while other party members are controlled by the AI. You have a special bar for your actions in battle: once it is depleted, you can't perform any action and must wait for your next turn. You can move freely over the battle field, position yourself strategically near or far away from the enemy, attack from different sides, and assign general strategies to your non-controllable party members.</desc>

These commands are used to interact with other characters and the game's environment, examine clues, or review facts. The results of choosing each command are displayed in the text.</desc>

	<name>FEDA: The Emblem of Justice</name>
	<desc>In a fantasy world, a soldier from the imperial forces deserts after witnessing the massacre of innocent villagers by his unit. He is sent to jail to be executed, but manages to escape with the help of two former unit colleagues. The group flees through the country-side, while being pursued by imperial soldiers. On their way, they join forces with other rebels to fight against the enemy, while uncovering hidden secrets and evil plots by the Empire.

FEDA: Emblem of Justice is a strategy RPG similar to Shining Force and other titles with preset characters and linear gameplay. The player commands a party of varying size and characters with diverse skills.

In the main battle sections, the player and the CPU-controlled enemy take turns moving the troops and giving orders. A menu at the bottom of the screen shows all the possible actions, where soldiers can defend, move, attack, or use an inventory item on each turn. The range of their movements and weapons vary according to their nature. A crossbow character can shoot from the back, while most sword and knife users have to be adjacent to their targets. Magic offensive powers have different ranges as well, reaching enemies that are far away from the attacking character. Health points can be recovered by eating rations or by magic, where a healer can restore points to several characters at once.

Each party member has separate health and magic points, as well as other statistics like defense and attack power. They receive experience points after slaying an enemy or casting a spell, and extra points at the end of the battle. Their skills increase after surpassing 100 points.

The map screen shows the party and groups of enemies traveling through the landscape in turns. The menu has options for moving the group or camping. In the encampment, one of the characters around the fire pit saves the game, while another inside the tent provides system options to change the interface color, adjust sound volume and rename the party members.

In some locations like temples, villages and towns, the party has to explore the place and talk to the citizens to move on to the next section. In later battles, the player has to make a moral choice about attacking mutated humans. At the end of each battle, the party is assigned a dark or light emblem, and certain party members choose to leave or stay in the group based on its alignment.</desc>

	<name>Final Fantasy II</name>
	<desc>This is the fourth entry in the  Final Fantasy series. It was known as Final Fantasy II internationally, because the  second and third games were never released outside of Japan.

The military country of Baron is one of the strongest in the land, with a proud army and a majestic air force known as the Red Wings. But, while their armies are kind and loyal, the recent actions of the King are anything but. The young Captain of the Red Wings, Cecil, is ordered to steal a crystal from a village of innocent magicians, and when he questions the actions of his King, Cecil is immediately thrown out of the country and sent off to kill strange monsters. Little does he realize the price the King's actions will pay, and what the true secret of the crystals, and their powers, truly is...

This is the first Final Fantasy game that introduced the famous ATB (active-time battle) system: during the battles, you have a time indicator for each party member that tells you when this character is able to act. If it takes you too long to select a command for this character, the enemy will act without waiting for your turn. The game abandons the job system that was implemented in the first and the third game in favor of pre-set character classes (paladin, white mage, ninja, etc.) assigned to each party member.

The PlayStation version adds a new rendered intro and ending.</desc>

	<name>Final Fantasy V</name>
	<desc>The Elemental Crystals...the life source of the planet. With them, gentle winds blow, the seas are active, fire burns bright, and the earth is full of life. All seems well in the world, until the wind suddenly stops, the sea begin to grow stagnant, the heat of fire becomes scarce, and the earth begins to wither. King Tycoon, sensing a premonition of evil, hurries off to check on the Wind Crystal, only to witness it destroy itself.

Meanwhile, a young traveler named Butz is camping in a field when a giant meteor strikes the planet. When he heads out to examine the meteor, he is shocked to find a young girl named Lenna, who is the princess of Tycoon, and a old man named Galuf, who is on a critical mission. Later, joined by Faris, a pirate captain, the foursome must travel the land in search of the destructor of the Crystals, and save the planet at any cost!

Final Fantasy V featured many new gameplay options and tactics, including an improved Job/Ability system (like in Final Fantasy Tactics), the return of the ATB (Active Time Battle) turn system, and all of the classic FF gameplay you've come to know and love!

Final Fantasy V was released as a stand-alone game in Japan, and again in Final Fantasy Collection. Its U.S. debut was as part of Final Fantasy Anthology. It was also later ported to the Gameboy Advance, adding 4 new Jobs, a new 30-floor dungeon, a bestiary, a music player, the ability to quick save anywhere, a few extra pieces of equipment, and a newly update translation.</desc>

	<name>Final Fantasy III</name>
	<desc>This is the sixth entry in the  Final Fantasy series. It was called Final Fantasy III because three of the five previous installments of the series were never released outside of Japan.

1,000 years ago, the War of the Magi occurred. People remember it as one of the most horrible tragedies in history. Since the War of the Magi, magic has been all but forgotten, technology began to grow, and people returned to seemingly normal lives. The only true worry people had was the Empire, whose leaders were looking to revive the great force once known as "magic".

But then...something happened that would change the course of history forever...

The Empire had heard word of the remains of a mystical being, known as an "Esper", being found in the mining town of Narshe. Quickly, three soldiers were dispatched to find this Esper and bring it to the Emperor. One of the soldiers, a young girl, triggers a power in the Esper that will begin one of the most dangerous series of events ever. And the only ones who can help her are a rag-tag band of rebels and heroes, whose very hearts and souls are the only ones that can save the world from the mad plans of the Empire.

The game maintains the ATB (active time battle) system of the two previous Final Fantasy games, spicing classic turn-based combat engine with a real-time element. The customization system combines character-specific classes with free-flowing character development. By finding various Espers and equipping them on characters, you can improve their parameters in different ways and choose the magic spells you want to learn for each character.</desc>

	<desc>A remake and expansion of the first NES/Famicom Fire Emblem, Marth must face the betrayal if Hardin and an old enemy he thought long vanquished, the Dragon King Medeus.

Book 1 of the game is essentially a remake of the first NES game. Book 2 continues the story with the same characters.

This game expands the series, however it drops explorable towns and the navigation through a world map which was introduced in Fire Emblem: Gaiden. New features include the ability to dismount the horse and pegasus mounted units, to allow the riders to fight indoors if needed.

At its most simple the story is of Prince Leaf of Lenster's struggle to free his native land from two forces, the Grandbell Empire and the Loptus religion.

Features introduced into this part of the series include fog of war and night maps with limited vision, this requires characters to use torches and wands to light their way. Also the capture command which allowed enemies to be subdued and their weapons taken.

	<name>From TV animation - Slam Dunk SD Heat Up!!</name>
	<desc>Among the most famous Japanese comics of the 90s are definitely Slam Dunk. The manga tells of the running track that will make the young hoodlum Hanamichi Sakuragi who joined the basketball club in Shohoku high school just because initially interested in the sister of the captain Akagi but later this sport will conquer him so much that he becomes a real basketman.

The game is essentially an arcade sports title basketball basically. The main screen there will be little choice given the presence of only three modes: Story mode and classic friendly tournament. In the first we follow the events of the television series whose plot differs slightly from the original one: using Shohoku then we will qualify for the national championship. The second and third but I think there is a need for further explanation.

Executable field operations would also be different, you can also feint shots and blow up their opponents markers. Then successfully accumulating a sequence of 'affirmative action' row (steps succeeded, baskets made or avoided), will fill a horizontal bar at the top of the screen and, as he did a little 'in the playroom with the SNK Street Hoop, pressing simultaneously the three keys will not dorsal (except B), you can make a super nice shooting with supplemental animations depending on the player used.

	<path>./Front Mission (Japan) [T-En by FH v1.0b].smc</path>
	<name>Front Mission</name>
	<desc>In the future, many military forces are dependent on huge mech robots, called Wanzers (Walking Panzers) for combat. At Huffman Island, located in the the pacific ocean, wanzers are deployed by both the USN (United States of the New Continent) and the OCU (Oceana Community Union), who dispute ownership over the island.  One night, the OCU forces stage a covert recon mission on a facility located in Larcus, a USN-held territory and weapons facility. Lead by a soldier named Roid, this mission was entirely unofficial and violated the peace treaty. During the mission, USN forces lead by Commander Driscoll appeared and ambushed the OCU soldiers. During the combat, Roid's fiance, Karen is killed and the USN facility is blown up; placing the blame on the OCU. This became known as the &amp;quot;Larcus Incident&amp;quot; and the OCU denied all knowledge of it's soldiers actions. Ultimately it would be a leading cause to the second Huffman War. 

One year later, the war is underway and Huffman island is under provisional control of the OCU, but with a weakened military unable to defend against USN attacks. The soldiers involved involved in the Larcus Incident have all been discharged and disgraced. Roid spends his time fighting as a gladiator in the Wanzer fighting arena before being approached by a mysterious man. Colonel Olson has found out about Roid's history and wants him to command a mercenary unit he is assembling on behalf of the OCU, dubbed &amp;quot;Carrion Crow&amp;quot;. Convincing Roid that Driscoll is still out there on the island, Roid agrees.

Front Mission is a turn-based strategy RPG played from an isometric perspective. Players progress in the story through large strategic battles involving multiple units and cutscenes between them. At certain places, usually towns, the player can visit multiple locations including bars and shops, and talk to people. Shops are also found to purchase new weaponry, parts and make repairs. In combat, each Wanzer robot is a seperate unit and, has a large variety of weapons and attack styles depending on what's equipped. Units get experience for defeating enemies and also for using various techniques. The more an attack is used, the more powerful it becomes.</desc>

	<path>./Front Mission Series - Gun Hazard (Japan) [T-En by Aeon Genesis v1.01].smc</path>
	<name>Front Mission - Gun Hazard</name>
	<desc>The year is 2064, when the great solar power satellite, ATLAS is overshadowed by the invention of fusion power. The government alliance that had supported the building of ATLAS now find themselves facing economic crisis as the balance of power shifts. In this world of conflict and change, the Walking Panzer, or Wanzer, (a form of mecha) becomes the standard armored unit for wars and petty battles across the globe. For the small nation of Bergen, a coup d'etat is underway, staged by Colonel Ark. Seeking to establish complete control over the government and the NORAD units stationed there, Ark's first step involves the capture of President Orwen. Tipped off to the rebellion, Orwen seeks to flee from Bergen, looking for safe passage out of the seaport of Port Ertothal. A young Wanzer pilot, Albert Grabner, is assigned escort duty to the president by loyal elements of the army stationed there...

Gun Hazard is a side-scrolling version of the Front Mission series. Gameplay is more than a little similar to Cybernator or Metal Warriors. The player moves between different stages on an area map. Once inside a level, the player controls Albert and his wanzer as it moves left, right across the screen. The wanzer is able to jump, and attack with a primary and a special weapon. At any time during a level, Albert can eject from his heavily armed wanzer to explore. Although vulnerable when outside, Albert is able to reach areas the wanzer cannot, in addition to being a smaller target and being able to jetpack indefinitely.

Additionally, Albert can recruit other characters through the normal course of the story, some of whom can be designated to support roles. These support characters when set can provide a variety of different cover fire abilities for Albert during his missions. They too gain experience and levels. Different weapons and armor can be found or bought. Essential components include the Booster ability which allows the wanzer to hover and increase it's jumps, as well as the Dash ability which allows quick left-right movement by the wanzer. Money and experience are earned through the completion of level objectives as well as the kill count of enemy wanzers.</desc>

	<desc>The legend of the Golden Condor... from village to village and  from town to town, everybody speak of it - somewhere, beyond forests and mountains, there lies an idyllic Golden Land, the land of eternal happiness. Many adventurers have tried to find their way to the mysterious land of the Golden Condor, but how many of them have survived the impassable mountain paths, the dark forests and caves, and the vicious monsters? You are the wanderer Shiren, and the goal of your life is to find the Golden Land. Together with your best buddy Koppa, a talking weasel, you decide to venture deep into the dungeons that lead to the land, and to try your luck there.

Furai no Shiren (The Wanderer Shiren) is a roguelike, hack-and-slash game with randomly generated dungeon areas, items, and monsters. Despite being named Fushigi no Dungeon 2 it has no relation to the storyline or characters of the first game in the series, it does however share the same style of gameplay. The movement is turn-based. You visit towns and villages where you can buy and sell supplies. The dungeons are full of various traps and monsters, and sometimes non-playable characters you can talk to, some of which can join you on your quest.

	<name>Galaxy Wars</name>
	<desc>Home version of the 1979 arcade game of the same name. The aim is to launch missiles from the bottom of the screen at enemy spacecraft located at the top. To get there, the missile must pass through a asteroid belt flying across the screen and avoid the shots being fired down from the spacecraft. It is the players job to control the missile. Once launched it can be moved left and right and can be sped up by using the boost to speed it's way out of trouble. Points scored depend on the location of the hit on the enemy spacecraft. The speed at which enemy spacecraft move increases as the number of them decreases. Once all spacecraft have been destroyed, another wave starts, the speed decreases again and the process repeats. A life is lost when a missile is hit by a shot or collides with an asteroid.

Three game modes are available, B&amp;W and Color recreate the graphics and behaviour of the original arcade game in black &amp; white and color respectively whilst Neo mode updates the game with improved graphics and slightly different behaviour. There's also a turn-based two player mode. Other options include changing the number of lives available at the start of a game and the number of points needed for an extra ship.</desc>

	<name>Ganbare Goemon 2</name>
	<desc>As you may have guessed from the number 2 in the title, this is the second SNES game in the popular blend of the adventure and jump and run genres which is the Goemon series. Again, you (and your partner, in 2 player mode) control Goemon, his friend Ebisu-Maru and, new to the bunch, robot Sasuke, through loads of action stages and villages. Another new feature comes with 3D boss fights, featuring the giant mech type robot called "Goemon Impact".

	<path>./Ganbare Goemon 3 - Shishi Juurokubee no Karakuri Manjigatame (Japan).smc</path>
	<name>Ganbare Goemon 3</name>
	<desc>Third title in the Ganbare Goemon series of platform/adventure games which cast you as the heroic Goemon as he attempts to save feudal Japan from all sorts of wacky evildoers. This time around, a time-travelling machine threatens all of Japan and thus Goemon and co. must jump into the future to stop the machine.

The game alternates between a top-down world map view in which your characters explore the gameworld and side-scrolling stages in which the main action lies. As in most games of the series there are also loads of mini-games and unique gameplay sequences such as maneuvering Goemon's giant mecha.

The game continues the tradition of bizarre humor unique to the series, you can play as either Goemon or any of his 3 companions, Ebisumaru, Sasuke or Yae with each sporting unique weapons and abilities and also with their own dialogue options and cutscenes, which feature sitcom-like pre-recorded laughs for added wackiness.

	<name>Ganbare Goemon Kirakira Dch: Boku ga Dancer ni Nat</name>
	<desc>Fourth title in the Ganbare Goemon series of platform/adventure games which cast you as the heroic Goemon and his gang of wacky adventurers as he fights evil all over Japan. This sequel however, takes the action to outer space as the gang attempts to rescue Goemon Impact (Goemon's giant mecha) from a strange planet.

The game is based around a stage-select hub from which you select which character you want to play as and then attempt to clear the game's many side scrolling stages in standard action platformer fashion, navigating the obstacles and defeating all enemies you run into with your weapons. Since each one of Goemon's allies got stranded on a different planet, you must take control of each one of them in order to clear the stages and recover the special ability unique to each character that must be later put to use to release Goemon Impact. As in other games of the series there are also loads of mini-games and unique gameplay sequences triggered in boss fights, bonus stages and special situations. These involve shooter sequences, racing &amp; sport games and other assorted diversions.</desc>

In Ganbare Daiku no Gensan, you must go through five stages (with two areas each), destroying workers that get in your way using your mallet. You can use it to perform two special attacks. One that sends fireballs going in all directions, and a more powerful one that sends shockwaves, destroying everything on screen. At the end of each area, a boss needs to be defeated in order to proceed to the next one.</desc>

	<path>./Ganpuru - Gunman's Proof (Japan) (Translated En).smc</path>
	<name>Gunple: Gunman's Proof</name>
	<desc>The year is 1880. Two meteors fell on Earth on a small island near North American Pacific Coast. In the middle of the island there is a small town governed by a sheriff. At first, the town's inhabitants didn't pay attention to the meteors. But then, strange things started happening. Monsters attacked people, and left on the victims' bodies a mysterious crest with one word: demiseed. One day you, a young boy who lives in the town, are contacted by two aliens who came in a miniature space ship. One of the aliens introduces himself as Zero, the Space Sheriff, and explains that an intergalactic criminal named Demi has escaped from justice and is hiding somewhere on the island, being the cause of all the troubles lately. Zero then possesses your body, lends you his powers, and commands you on the quest to destroy Demi and to bring peace to your island and to the alien world alike!

The game is an action/adventure with slight RPG elements (buying and upgrading weapons, etc.) set in Wild West. While featuring traditional dungeon-crawling and many enemies to dispose of in real time combat, the game doesn't equip you with standard medieval swords, but with pistols, shotgun, machine gun, and even a flamethrower. Your weapons have infinite ammo. You can duck to avoid the alien monsters' fire, and perform special attacks with various types of weapons.</desc>

	<desc>One year ago they took from you your wife. Now it's time to pay them back, with interest.

Gekitotsu Dangan Jidousha Kessen: Battle Mobile plays similarly to Spyhunter in both perspective and objective, but your car in Battle Mobile isn't quite as high tech an instrument as that other game's vehicle. You can launch unlimited missiles, but they can only hit helicopters. For ground based targets you must dash into them to ram them off the road. Your car's health is constantly dwindling, even when you're not being attacked by enemies, so picking up the occasionally appearing energy refill items is essential. Shields can be picked up and stored that will make your car invulnerable to all damage for a short while.</desc>

	<name>Genocide 2</name>
	<desc>The world is still recovering from war. The mega-corporation CONEX has been spearheading the rebuilding process, but their true intentions are far from altruistic. By gobbling up their competition, and with the help of new weapons technology, CONEX is on the cusp of controlling the world. Only a hero from the last war can defy them and stop their plans of conquest.

Genocide 2 is a modified version of the PC release. The player takes control of a ten meter tall robotic ninja: the Tracer. Its only form of attack is a sword, but it can hold several extra weapons, and always has access to the Betty. The Betty can be fired in eight directions, returns to the Tracer after being fired, and can block enemy bullets. The objective of each stage is to reach the end, and some stages require you to destroy targets along the way. Any items picked up by the player, or damage done to the Tracer, carries over between stages, and each stage records your fastest time for beating them.

Aside from the visual downgrade, Genocide 2 also lost many minor enemy types and one mid-boss in the transition to the Super Famicom. The first stage was removed, and the first two levels of stage 2 were reversed. The Betty now can only be used for a limited time, and must recharge when its time has run out.</desc>

	<name>Ghost Chaser Densei</name>
	<desc>Ghost Chaser Densei doesn't take any dramatic departures from the standard scrolling-brawler plot-line. A city twenty minutes in the future must be saved from a terrorist organization, and between salvation and you is a long, straight line full of goons who must be punched. Aside from receiving orders from your boss before each level, and the quick conversation with a boss or rare NPC, the story won't attempt to get in the way of beat-downs.

There are three playable characters in Ghost Chaser Densei: the martial artist Makai, the mace wielding cat-girl Iyo, and the autonomous robot Belva. Each has unique moves as well as the basic abilities of attacking, jumping, blocking, throwing, and using a special if attack and jump are pressed together. Unlike most brawlers these special moves deplete a recharging special bar, not your health. Makai can throw fireballs and do a flying kick in midair, Iyo can triangle jump and preform a spinning piledriver, and Belva can double jump and preform a grapple special. Characters also have a team up special if playing in two player mode. Enemies range from armored soldiers to lizard men to robots, but most break down into the same hierarchy: weaker types will rush at you while stronger types will shoot projectiles then rush at you. Each level ends with a unique boss with multiple short and long range attacks.</desc>

	<name>Go Go Ackman</name>
	<desc>Ackman is not what one would call a good person. His job is to murder and steal souls for the Demon Lord. The angel Tenshi has taken it upon himself to put an end to Ackman's nefarious ways, and sends an army of angels and hired assassins to take out Ackman for good. It's just as well, because Ackman was getting bored without anyone to kill.

Go Go Ackman is a scrolling platformer starring the titular Ackman. Ackman can punch and charge up a ranged wave of energy, and he can also jump on some enemies to stun them before running into them and turning them into a sliding projectile. Ackman can hold up to three bombs that can clear the screen of enemies, and can also hold a weapon, either a sword, boomerang, or pistol, but it will be lost if Ackman is hit. Levels are linear, but do allow some exploration to find weapons and items hidden off the beaten road.</desc>

The angel Tenshi is still determined to end Ackman's nefarious ways, and this time he has enlisted the help of the angelic rock band Metal Angel. Ackman still murders at whim and has his companion Godon collect the souls of his slain, but this time Ackman can keep the weapons he finds, either sword, boomerang, or gun. Each weapon can be upgraded twice, but upgrades will be lost if Ackman is hit or finds a new weapon. Ackman can also now throw smaller enemies, although he can't move while holding them.

But, what's this, it seems there's been a shake up in the chain of command, and now Tenshi is wanted by the Angel Police! Will Tenshi be able to clear his good name? Who's really pulling the strings here? And, most importantly, does Ackman care about any of this at all?

The last of the Ackman games, Go Go Ackman 3 makes very few changes from Go Go Ackman 2, although Tenshi is now a playable character. Both Ackman and Tenshi can be switched between at special points in a level, but they share the same health meter and weapon. Unlike Ackman Tenshi can fly, but as he is an angel he can not collect the souls of enemies he kills. Souls have changed too, and are now used as currency in shops where Ackman can buy temporary powerups or healing. Finally Ackman has lost the ability to slide enemies along the ground, but he can now move while holding a stunned enemy.</desc>

	<path>./Gokujou Parodius (Japan).smc</path>
	<name>Gokujou Parodius</name>
	<desc>Konami's Gradius and space-shooter parody series continues with this second installment.  Gameplay is similar to the Gradius series in that you control a ship that can move anywhere on the screen while the screen itself scrolls from left to right. Enemies appear in waves and destroying all the fighters in a single wave releases power-ups which may be used to choose your ships upgrade. The Upgrade bar too is lifted from Gradius, however each character has different names and functions for their upgrades.

In Gokujyou Parodius, you are now able to now choose from 11 different characters... many of whom appear from other Konami games. They include:

1. Vic Viper: a ship from Gradius

2. Takosuke: the "octopus" of the previous Parodius game, and also seen in at least one Goemon

3. Twinbee: making his appearance from the Twinbee side scrolling games, Twinbee is a squat round robot with a jetpack and a disproportionately big punching glove

4. Pentaro: the original "joke character", Pentaro made an appearence in a previous Gradius title as a flying penguin. However he does star in his own games as well, Konami's Penguin Adventure

5. Hikaru: Hikaru is a girl in a tight fighting "bunny suit" who is riding on top of a missile

6. Mambo: Mambo is a strange looking fish with two horns on the top of his head and on his underside

7. Michael: some kind of fat angel pig. He has wings and a golden halo over his head

8. Koitsu: A blue stick man riding on a surfboard. He's probably one of the more 'normal' characters

9. Goemon: star of the Goemon series of games. Goemon is a ninja warrior equipped with wooden pipes. He flies around in a superman pose for his appearance in Parodius

10. Dracula: star of Konami's Kid Dracula, this white haired squat character retains his vampiric abilities including that of being able to change into a bat

11. Upa: a flying baby. Upa is actually from a Konami game by the name of Bokutte Upa but is probably just more recognizable as "the flying baby" of this crazy shooter

In addition to your player-character, the levels themselves will be full of a strange mix of Konami references, bright colors and the just plain zany. it's not uncommon to have to fly your ship underneath a woman's legs for example or chased by a giant walrus or having enemies shooting cute pink hearts at you.</desc>

	<name>Gourmet Sentai: Bara Yarou</name>
	<desc>In Gourmet Sentai: Bara Yarou the player picks from three characters: Bonjour, Mademoiselle, and Très Bien. Each has slightly different movesets to use on downed or stunned opponents, but each posses the punch, throw, and jump usual for belt-scrolling brawlers. The characters must get past several minor enemies on each level before fighting a stronger boss at the end. Each enemy will drop a cooking ingredient when defeated, and at the end of each level two ingredients can be combined to make a meal that will restore some health based on if the chosen character likes it or not. Environments range from slums and palaces to high speed trains and space ships, but in general there is not much continuity between different areas.</desc>

	<path>./GT Racing (Japan).smc</path>
	<name>GT Racing</name>
	<desc>GT Racing is a Super Famicom racing video game where the player gets to drive a Gran Turismo car in either championship or practice mode.  The game is based on the 1996 Super GT racing season using the horsepower standards and rules of the era.  

During championship mode, the player is asked enter a number, his or her driver's name, and the team name that he or she will use during the championship. The driver's name and team can be entered using either English or Japanese letters. When a player beats a record, he or she is asked to insert his or her number, name or initials (up to four characters and two digits for the number). Championship mode can last for multiple seasons. Playing ninety-nine seasons in a single racing career is theoretically possible due to the double-digit nature of the season information. There are eight different tracks, including the Suzuka Circuit that has been shown in video games since Pole Position II and Fuji Speedway (complete with a virtually photorealistic Mount Fuji in the background).

Versus mode is for two human players only and the record options allows the players to look at his or her previous records. In a race, there are up to fifteen opponents to race against. The player gets rewarded with an opportunity to upgrade his or her equipment after a top five finish on any race course. Bonus equipment includes a faster engine, better tires, and a special dose of nitrous oxide created specifically for Gran Turismo vehicles. All of the bonus automobile parts are automatically installed in the appropriate parts for supercharging the vehicle. Once all the special parts are earned, the automobile is considered to be fully upgraded. The ultimate goal is to win the Gran Turismo championship for his or her team in addition for him/herself.

The "free practice" is essentially a time trial mode where the player races by him/herself for up to ten laps. Acquiring damage is still possible either crashing into walls or through normal wear and tear. The fastest lap time gets captured for the record book just like in the other modes of the game. Before being able to practice freely, the player can also choose the weather condition and the setup of his vehicle</desc>

	<name>Hameln no Violin Hiki</name>
	<desc>In Violinist of Hameln you play the role of Hamel, a sort of wanderer / adventurer whose weapon is a violin. His music can cover enemies in fear, or even control their minds. Hamel and his mascot Oboe arrives at Staccato, a small town attacked by monsters, and drives them away with his power. Impressed, a cute little girl named Flute decides to go with Hamel in order to find and destroy the evil power behind the attacks.

The game is typical platform. You play as Hamel, and with your violin can shoot musical notes to beat your enemies. However, you count with Flutes aid. Flute follows you (although you can order her to stop and stay), but also can be grabbed and thrown at the enemies (yes, thrown at the enemies). Flute can also collect through all the stages some costumes that, when worn, give her special abilities, such as flying, leaping, breaking walls or even explode and kill all in screen. At the end of each stage, of course, youll find the typical boss, all named as musical instruments.

	<name>Hat Trick Hero 2</name>
	<desc>Hat Trick Hero 2 is the follow up to Hat Trick Hero, and it is loosely based on the arcade game Hat Trick Hero '93. One or two players can play in a exhibition game (one single match) or in a world league. The game scrolls horizontally uses mode 7 graphics to give the playing field some perspective.

There are 18 countries to select from, each with different running, kicking and technical abilities. You can use 5 different formations, which are 4-4-2, 4-3-3, 3-5-2, WM and libero. You also select a team captain from 8 different characters.

You can perform a foul tackle on the opponent, but when the referee is close enough to notice it you risk getting a yellow or red card. By holding down a direction after shooting the players can shoot the ball with curve effect. During the game a power-up bar is charged which can be used for special abilities. Holding down R allows you to run faster, but this slowly drains the power-up bar. With a fully charged power-up bar you can perform an unstoppable hyper shoot by pressing a special combination, and this drains the power-up bar entirely.</desc>

Cast into the role of a young boy from a remote village, you live a peaceful life until one day the pigs in your village go crazy, and as a result you are thrown underground, only to be saved by mysterious fairies. Something goes wrong, and the world as you knew it doesn't exist any more. You must establish contact to the great gods and other famous characters from the Greek mythology in order to restore the balance.

Like the previous games of the series, this is a standard console-style RPG with turn-based combat viewed from first-person perspective. There is a day/night cycle, which influences not only the appearance of the world map and the towns, but also the schedules of the world's inhabitants.</desc>

The background story is based on the manga/animé of the same name. The years is 199X, and the world lies in ruins. Technology can no longer be used, and the land is controlled by fighters of rivaling styles. In this game, you can choose one of the fighter characters of the series: the main hero Kenshiro, his brother and rival Raou, Nanto Seiken fighters Rei and Souther, the assassin Heart, and others. You fight one-on-one, filling an energy bar and performing various attacks and techniques. There is a free fight mode where you choose your opponent yourself, and a two-player mode.

	<desc>Similar to the  sixth installment of the series, this is a fighting game along the lines of Street Fighter or Mortal Kombat. It is based on the main storyline of the manga/animé series Hokuto no Ken, also known as Fist of the North Star. 

After a terrible disaster mankind has stopped advancing the technology, and the world became a huge wasteland, controlled by fighter organizations. The main hero, Kenshirou of the Hokuto Shinken school, falls in love with a girl named Julia, who is abducted by one of the Nanto Seiken fighters, Shin. 

In the game, the player can choose to fight as various characters from the series, including Kenshirou, his brother Raou, the Emperor Souther, the leader of Nanto Seiken Rei, and others. There are three modes in the game: story mode, battle mode, and free fight mode.

1. In story mode, the player fights as Kenshirou in pre-determined battles that reflect the story of the series (like facing the assassin Heart). 
In battle mode, the player participates in a tournament by choosing one of the characters. 
In free fight mode, the player choses characters as well as the opponents. During battles, the player must first accumulate energy in order to unleash devastating techniques unique to each character.

	<name>Holy Umbrella: Dondera no Mubo</name>
	<desc>In "Holy Umbrella", you control a schoolboy who lives in modern-day Japan. One day, the sky suddenly turns dark blue, a heavy rain falls onto the city, and the boy finds, halfway between his house and the school, an umbrella which seems to have fallen from the sky. What he does not know is that the umbrella is magical! The moment he touches it, he is transfered to a parallel universe. Immediately, he is attacked by a huge tank, but a strange old man with a talking bird saves him. It seems that an evil creature named Dondera is threatening the country with the terrible monsters she created. But is it really so? You visit the capital town, talk to the emperor, and decide to investigate the matter...

"Holy Umbrella" is essentially a platform action game, but unlike most other games of this genre, it allows you to visit towns, where you control your hero in a standard RPG-like top-down fashion. You can enter houses, talk to townspeople, etc. On platform levels, which are the main part of the game, you have to switch between the hero, the talking bird Bonto who accompanies you on your quest, and the girl Saki, whom you meet later in the game. Every character has his/her own special abilities and own ways of fighting: the hero can slide through air by using the umbrella, Bonto can double-jump on high ledges, Saki can jump on walls, etc. You use your umbrella as a weapon, as well as elemental stones you can collect on your way and throw at enemies. You also find various power-ups and items you can equip on the hero.</desc>

	<name>The Iron Commando</name>
	<desc>Iron commando is a brawler beat-em-up like Final Fight or Streets of Rage with lots of weapons and big end bosses.

The B-movie story is cheesy and does nothing more than accommodate for the action. From the introduction sequence: "The peril came from outer space. A meteorite entered the earth's atmosphere bringing chaos. After observation, the scientists found that the meteorite was radioactive and had to be destroyed. Unfortunately, terrorists from g.h.o.s.t. want the meteorite too. The Iron Commando's mission is to retrieve the deadly body and avoid genetic mutation."

The player or players walk along the levels beating up enemies. On some levels you ride a motorcycle or jeep, even a mine kart, and shoot your way through hordes of enemies. There are several end bosses, some are screen filling like a helicopter and a giant robot.

Some enemies will drop food, grenades or weapons as you beat them into a bloody pulp. There are lots of different Weapons: 9mm guns, shotguns, machine guns, knives, baseball bats. The weird thing is, enemies that use a sword and even dogs will occasionally drop a machine gun or baseball bat.

	<desc>Jaleco Rally: Big Run: The Supreme 4WD Challenge is a rally racing game and sim in which the player takes part in the Paris-Dakar rally. The game actually begins in Tripoli, Libya and passes through around 2,500 miles of African desert, swamp and jungle on the way to Dakar.Jaleco originally developed the game for the Arcades before porting it to the Super Famicom. This home version was never released outside of Japan. The game was also ported to the Amiga and Atari ST, where it is known simply as Big Run.GameplayIn addition to passing each checkpoint under the required time - the checkpoint system ubiquitous in solo racing games of the era - the player must also be aware of environmental dangers along the course and needs to select a sponsor, navigator and engineer team before starting. They must also balance the weight of their car, as too few replacement parts might cause a problem further into the race yet having too many will greatly reduce the car's top speed.</desc>

	<name>Smart Ball</name>
	<desc>The game involves going through 8 stages (broken up into two parts each) of side-scrolling action. At the end of each stage is a boss monster that must be disposed of.

Jerry moves by sliding across the ground and can latch on to walls and climb them. Jerry can also jump, stretch out to cling to ceilings, and also move at a faster pace. Jerry can consume balls that he finds during a stage and can then fire them out of his body at enemies blocking his path. Enemies can also be defeated by jumping on them and then flattening Jerry's body on them. Also, there are flowers that contain items for Jerry to collect. Items include life, which refills health, a 1-up that adds an extra life, and a seed, which will grow a climbable beanstalk when planted. If the player collects the scattered letters that appear in every stage that spell out the name Jerry, the player will earn two extra lives.</desc>

	<path>./Jikkyou Oshaberi Parodius (Japan).smc</path>
	<name>Jikkyou Oshaberi Parodius</name>
	<desc>The third in the Paroidus series, it's the same gameplay and zaniness that substantiated the first two games. Gameplay itself is a copy (a parody rather) of Konami's famous Gradius series in that the screen scrolls from left to right (most times) and you maneuver around the screen destroying waves of enemies and avoiding obstacles. Unlike previous Parodius titles, this game contains a difficulty adjustment option, allowing the player to make things easier... or harder. Also unique to this parodius title is a bit of japanese digital voice that shouts out various things at you while you play. Survival throughout the level earns you a boss fight, which frequently includes some of the strangest characters in the game. Make no mistake, this *is* Gradius,  but with all sorts of strange graphics, music and references to other Konami games... So in other words, it's Parodius!

There are now more power-ups than ever including the standard power-up (red, used to upgrade weapons), the shield power-up (blue) and a variety of different coloured bells. Green Bells will make you huge on the screen, Yellow Bells are worth points (points in turn are worth extra lives), Blue Bells are "big bombs" that clear the screen of enemies/shots and can be saved until you need them, White Bells will give your character a megaphone that will shout out japanese phrases, the characters of the phrases themselves can be used to damage enemies (the power of words!), The Red Bell stockpiles you with three point-defense lasers... only one of which can be activated at a time and disappear after a short while. Finally the purple bell will clear the screen of all but the strongest enemies... and will turn them into power-ups.

This time around there are 16 different characters to chose from and the power-ups and weapons that they use are more unique than ever. Several familiar "faces" return and they've brought along friends to share in the party:
Vic Viper: The "gradius ship" appears once again in this gradius parody, equipped with it's traditional gradius weapons
2. Lord British: The "other" Gradius ship and arguably the more famous of the two. Lord British has weapons similar to Vic but quite different also.Missiles and shields work differently for instance. And Lord British uses a Ripple gun instead of a double shot.
3. Pentaro: It just wouldn't be a Parodius game if Pentaro wasn't involved. Originally from Konami's Penguin Adventure, Pentaro retains the same abilities from previous Parodius games... however his Potion weapon may now hit multiple enemies and his normal weapon shots explode against obstacles
4. Hanako: Also from Penguin Adventure, Hanako the penguin is Pentaro's girlfriend. While Pentaro is blue, she is the red penguin. She plays nearly identical to Pentaro with the exception of her S. Bomb weapon
5. Twinbee: Twinbee, from the Twinbee games is another returning Parodius star. Unfortunately he hasn't been upgraded since previous games, so his weapons are nearly identical; Punching Glove Rocket and all...
6. Winbee: Winbee, also from Twinbee is red and has moves identical to Twinbee, except for one difference... when she has 3 Options available, she can power them up to harm enemies that touch them.
7. Tako: Again, it just wouldn't be a parodius game without a flying octopus. And here he is, still wearing a baseball cap, but otherwise unchanged from previous Parodius games.
8. Belial: A yellow female octopus with a bow in her hair, she is identical to Tako with the exception of her Missile and Double weapons... which are instead identical to the Vic Viper.
9. Soitsu: A stickman (now green) surfing aboard a paper airplane, Soitsu plays similar to Koitsu from the previous game, aside from his colour. His laser weapon is able to charge up to deliver more power and he drops little stickmen onto the ground which occasionally dance around rather than attacking. Additionally he has an "upgrade power" (S. Power) that make all his other abilities stronger
10. Doitsu: Similar to Soitsu but with a Double Laser ability. He is an orange stickman riding on a paper airplane and no "upgrade" power, using normal options instead
11. Upa: Upa aka The Flying Baby is back from the previous Parodius game (as well as his original game, Bokutte Upa) and plays nearly the same. Instead of a shield, he has a Mega Crush power that damages all on-screen enemies... and also has an "Upgrade Power" in the form of Grade Up that makes his other abilities stronger.
12. Rupa: Another flying baby (presumably also from Bokutte Upa), Rupa plays similar tot Upa but with a Multi Spread gun which fires missiles in multiple directions (with each upgrade) and a S.Vulcan gun which automatically aims towards enemies.
13. Mike: A cute little kitten who happens to to have a very powerful wave weapon which can travel through obstacles and enemies. Additionally he has a multiple bomb ability which requires his "upgrade ability" (Grade Up) to get really powerful
14. Rani: Another cute kitten (this one rolled onto his bottom facing forward) with very power weaponry. Some of the highlights include a Reflect weapon wherein the shots bounce off of obstacles. Another is the S laser which travels forward but then homes in Up or Down to hit the enemy. And finally, Rani's missile weapon is two homing bells. Rani also has an "upgrade ability" in the form of Grade Up, however it only upgrades the Reflect Shot.
15. Memim: One of the fairy characters, Memim is a female flying girl with standard female bikini clothing. She carries some unique missile weapons however, whose direction is determined by Memim's current location on the screen when fired.
16. Sue: The other fairy with tight clothing, Sue is unique in that her weapons are upgraded/displayed in a different order from everybody else's in the game. For instance her Option is the 4th weapon on the list rather than the 6th... requiring less power-ups to activate it. However aside from that... all of her weapons are the exact same as the Vic Viper's.</desc>

Select your character with his unique stats and movesets, and go at it against any opponent from four fictional leagues with dozens of moves, submission holds and rope maneuvers in or out of the ring.

The game uses pre-rendered 2D sprites and features Vs, Tournament, and League play for up to four players. Also included is a career mode where you create a wrestler and control each aspect of his career up to his final victory in the inter-league tournament. And you can also configure matches to be standard, tag (with 4 or 6 wrestlers), submission or death-matches which adds such features as live wires and explosives to the ring.</desc>

	<path>./JoJo no Kimyou na Bouken (Japan) (Translated En).smc</path>
	<name>Jojo no Kimy na Bken</name>
	<desc>One of the earliest titles based on the animé series Jojo's Bizarre Adventures, this game is not a pure fighter, like Capcom's more known title, but an adventure/RPG hybrid with turn-based fights.

In a futuristic world, there lives a young man named Jojo who holds a terrible power within: the power to drain life from enemies. This power is somehow connected to the evil vampire Dio who is terrorizing the world. Jojo must find faithful companions on his quest to restore peace and to master the power within himself.

In this game, you navigate Jojo in an adventure-like fashion, viewing the hero from third-person perspective.

	<name>Jutei Senki</name>
	<desc>Jutei Senki is a turn-based strategy game, never released outside of Japan. The game takes place in an alternate universe where centuries ago humanity and their tree soldiers called Junei fight against Letum, a race of robots powered by magic.

The player commands the human army. The mission in each battle is to defeat the enemy army or take their headquarters in a limited amount of turns. In the human army's main building, the player can recruit new soldiers, but their number is limited. Each unit has its own statistics, including range, speed and attack power. Battles are carried out automatically, with animations on a separate screen.

There are three mission modes which include Campaign, Tutorial, and Expert modes and there is also a two-player versus mode.</desc>

In the late game (as the game follows the MS: Gundam film story) the player controls the Gundam and two Guncannons.

	<desc>Kikou Keisatsu Metal Jack is a scrolling brawler based on the anime of the same name. At the start of the game the player can choose from Red Jack, Silver Jack, or Blue Jack. Red and Silver both have weapons they can find ammo for in levels (a gun and baton, respectively), and all three can do a multiple hit combo or a jumping attack. At the end of a level the Jack will be met by his vehicle which will then merge with his armor. In this form the Jack's attacks are strengthened and he can charge up an attack that hits every enemy onscreen.

There is no story told at any point in the game, so if you want to know what's going on you'll have to track down the anime.</desc>

	<name>Kishin Douji ZENKI: Battle Raiden</name>
	<desc>Once already Chiaki and her reluctant demon servant Zenki have saved the world from the forces of darkness, but apparently once is never enough. Chiaki has a vision of five cloaked figures and knows that only she and Zenki can stop them. At once they set off to track down the demon leaders.

In Kishin Douji ZENKI: Battle Raiden the player takes the role of Zenki. At first, and occasionally through the game, Zenki will be in his powered down form where he can only punch, jump, and dash. After Chiaki recovers her bracelet, or regains her concentration, or whatever she needs to do at the time, she can transform Zenki into his powered up form. In this form Zenki deals more damage and has a much longer list of attacks that get added to as the game progresses, such as a pillar of energy, an electrified punch, and a dashing attack. By picking up scrolls Zenki can do a powerful Rudora attack to all enemies on screen, but this attack damages Zenki as well.

To complete platforming levels Zenki will have to make it to the end of the level while occasionally finding hidden stone monuments that, when destroyed, will drop items as well as alter the level or remove obstacles, allowing Zenki to pass. After a stage's first platforming level is a midboss fight, and after the second platforming level is the boss fight proper.</desc>

	<name>Kouryuu Densetsu Villgust - Kieta Shoujo</name>
	<desc>This game is based on the animé series Villgust. The main hero of the game is Shun, a teenager who lives in modern-day Japan. One day, when he was going back from school with his girlfriend Michiko, Shun noticed a strange red-eyed rabbit. When he tried to follow him, Shun suddenly found himself all alone in a forest clearing. He was immediately approached by a group of four adventurers who said they were members of a group called R.A.G.E. (Resistance Against God of Evil). Apparently, Shun was transported into a parallel medieval world, and an evil organization known as Vile was the one behind Michiko's kidnapping. Shun and his friends will now do anything to help Michiko and to destroy Vile!

This is a traditional console-style RPG. You travel on the world map, visit towns, buy equipment and items, descend into dungeons, and fight random enemies in turn-based combat viewed from a third-person "over-the-shoulder" perspective. The party can hold up to five characters. The characters level up in a standard way, and also get experience and new levels for their magical spells.

	<name>Kunio no Oden</name>
	<desc>Another tournament rocks the streets around the Nekketsu High area, and you know Kunio and his gang aren't going to let an opportunity to prove how baddass they are pass them by.

The tournament this time is an eating contest, and the game itself plays like a block-lining puzzle game in the grand tradition of Tetris and Puyo Puyo. You must line-up blocks of the same type as they fall in the classic rectangular play area, clearing them before time runs up or they fill the entire screen. Features a 1P tournament mode, and a 2P competitive Vs mode in which you can chain blocks and send them to your opponent as "attacks" in hopes of causing him/her to lose.</desc>

	<name>Kunio-kun no Dodge Ball da yo: Zenin Shgo</name>
	<desc>16-bit sequel to the cult-classic Super Dodge Ball which unfortunately only saw a Japanese release.

The game continues the "Worldwide Dodge Ball tournament" motif of the original in which several teams from around the world compete in side scrolling dodge ball matches to see which one is the best. Gameplay is similar to other sport games in which you control the character that has the ball at the time (although a lead character always marks the formations and generally controls the team), and special moves can be executed to try and eliminate your opponents (such as homing throws and other esoteric moves). 

This sequel also adds more comprehensive tournament mechanics, for instance your performance in each match allows you to buy power-ups and special moves to enhance your players, you can also create a custom team and manage them throughout the tournament by adding or removing members as you see fit (you can even try to lure players from opposing teams). You can also choose among a series of formations and AI profiles in case you play alone, although you can use a multi-tap to play with up to 4 players.

Available game modes include Tournament, Vs and Mechabutsuke mode which is a variation on Vs that involves a free-roaming court and no outfielders.</desc>

	<desc>You are a boy named Gulliver, who lives together with his two best friends - the girl Misty and the young inventor Edison - in Venice, Italy. The evil Prince of Spain, Judou, is after the mysterious Blue Crystals who grant immense power to those who possess them.

Now Gulliver swears revenge and embarks, together with Misty and Edison, on a grand journey that will take him to several cities and countries all over the world, from Rome to Himalaya.

The game is an action RPG in which you can switch characters.

	<name>Laplace no Ma</name>
	<desc>1924, the town Newcam, Massachusetts. On the outskirts of the town stands the Weathertop mansion. It was just an ordinary place until the last owner, Benedict Weathertop, started practicing black magic. He killed his parents and populated the mansion with all kinds of undead. Since then, nobody dared to approach the mansion. But a short while ago, two boys were found dead near this horrible place. Apparently, the boys had tried to enter the mansion. Another evidence pointed out that a girl followed them - but her body hasn't been found yet, and there is a slight hope she might be alive. 
This is where you, the hero of the game, decide to investigate the mystery, and to venture into the mansion...

"Devil of Laplace" is a hybrid between survival horror and traditional Japanese RPG, similar to the pioneer of this genre, Sweet Home for NES. Unlike "Sweet Home", this game has less puzzles and is more oriented towards RPG elements. You are not stuck in the mansion, but can leave it, visit the town, and buy supplies. Later you also visit other locations such as a castle, etc. The battles are random, turn-based, and are viewed from first-person perspective. The hero of the game can recruit three other characters to the party of five available. Each character (including the hero, to whom you assign gender and class) belongs to one of the five character classes: Dilettante, Medium, Detective, Scientist, or Journalist. Dilettante is an all-around character with defensive magic, Medium is a kind of a black mage, Detective is a melee fighter, Scientist can construct powerful machines to perform various techniques, and the Journalist can take pictures of the monsters, which is the only way to gain money in the game.</desc>

	<name>Lennus II: Fin no Shito</name>
	<desc>This is a follow-up to the game "Lennus", which is know outside of Japan as  Paladin's Quest. The game is set in a world of Andell - a floating continent where ancient prophecies and highly advanced technology co-exist. A curse has fallen onto Andell - its four island, once united, are now separated, and are floating away from the heart of the continent, the temple of Andell. The sages of the temple summon a great hero named Farse, who must find a special magic orb for each one of the islands, which is the only way to re-unite them. Farse embarks on his journey, aided by three Terranos, the big-eared inhabitants of Andell.

This is a console-style RPG where you control a party containing the main hero Farse and three Terranos you select out of the available five. You encounter random enemies and bosses and fight them in turn-based combat viewed from first-person perspective. You can use special attacks and magical spells, which don't consume magic points, but take away a certain amount of your hit points. Instead of healing items, you have mini-bottles you can refill with potions in special places in towns. You can equip various magical artifacts which will allow you to use magic spells belonging to eight different elements.</desc>

	<name>Little Magic</name>
	<desc>May is an apprentice mage at Magic School and must pass the final exam.

A puzzle game seen from a top-down perspective. The goal of each level is to open the exit by pushing a magic stone on a designated spot. May can also push objects one tile ahead without moving herself. This is often used to get the stone over water that she can't cross herself. May's other ability is to create magic bubbles. She can create bubbles in three different sizes. Bubbles will pop after a certain amount of time, depending on their size. If they pop while next to the stone or another bubble, the stone or bubble will be moved one space. Since May can create several bubbles simultaneously, it is possible, and often necessary, to create chain reactions to maneuver the stone into the desired position.

As the game progresses, levels become increasingly difficult and new hazards and enemies are introduced. Enemies follow a set movement pattern and can sometimes be stopped, but not destroyed by magic bubbles. Later levels are made more complicated by different types of tiles including: grass that slows down May, ice that May and the magic stone will slip over, spikes that destroy the stone if it is pushed into them, collapsing tiles that can only be walked over once, rune tiles on which May cannot create magic bubbles, teleporters and others.</desc>

	<desc>In "Live a Live", you control seven main characters and play through seven different stories set in seven different time periods: prehistoric age, medieval Europe, feudal Japan, a futuristic world with robots and weird machines, etc. Those stories appear to have no common points, yet after completing all of them, you'll see they are in fact connected - the worlds of all those characters are threatened by the same ultimate evil force.

The combat features many innovations compared to traditional console RPGs: your position on the battle field is important, and certain techniques can be used only from certain positions, and enemy attacks also affect only specific parts of the field. Out of the seven chapters, some have more battle-oriented gameplay, while others are more devoted to puzzle-solving and information-gathering.

The game is one of the least known Squaresoft products, and was never released outside of Japan.</desc>

	<desc>All the king's candy has been stolen by invaders who live down in the dungeon. The king summons twin heroes: Justy and Liberty to try to get it back.

Lode Runner Twin: Justy to Liberty no Daibouken is a side-scrolling platform game, adapted for the SNES from the original Lode Runner. However the atmosphere has changed to a lot more cartoonish and happy. Controlling either Justy or Liberty, the player is able to move back and forth, climb ladders, cross ropes and dig holes in some types of surface. The enemies then fall into these holes and the player can walk over them. The goal in each level is to get all the candy.

There is also a battle mode that puts Justy versus Liberty to see who can fetch the most candy.

	<desc>The game is set in the same universe and shares characters and storyline with  Puyo Puyo puzzle games. Unlike Puyo Puyo, Mado Monogatari is a Japanese-style RPG. You play Arle, a five-year old apprentice magician. She is attending a special kindergarten, and it is time for the Final Exam. At the same time, Arle receives a mysterious letter that tells her that if she finds eight magical gems and takes them to the Wizard Mountain, she'll be granted one wish. Arle decides to search for the gems which are scattered all over the world, and to overcome all the obstacles with her great magic power!

The game features random enemy encounters and turn-based combat, which takes place on a platform (Arle to the left, the enemies to the right). You can't perform physical attacks at all, and your only way of harming enemies is through magic. During the game, you learn a variety of magic spells, which can be upgraded later. In battles you can't see your own and the enemies' hit points, and have to act according to your intuition.

	<desc>This game is based on the anime and manga by manga artist CLAMP.

In the land of Cephiro, the world was kept in peace and harmony by the wishes of Princess Emauraude, the Pillar of Balance. But the evil priest, Lord Zagato, has kidnapped Emauraude, and Cephiro is being invaded by deadly beasts. If this continues, Zagato will gain complete control of Cephiro! The only ones who can stop him are the legendary Magic Knights...

And those Magic Knights are three young girls from Earth. Hikaru Shidou, Umi Ryuuzaki, and Fuu Hououjii have been plucked from modern-day Tokyo and brought to Cephiro by Emauraude, and they're the only ones who can defeat Zagato...as the Magic Knights!

This interpretation of the manga story is a traditional Japanese-style RPG. The player controls the three main heroines as a party; each one uses different weapons and learns various skills. Typically for the genre, the party roams the top-down world, visits towns, descends into dungeons, chats with non-playable characters, and fights randomly appearing enemies in turn-based style.</desc>

	<name>Majyuuou</name>
	<desc>Abel's daughter has been kidnapped by his former friend, Bayer.  Bayer has sold his soul to the devil, and sacrificed Abel's wife, in an attempt to resurrect the King of Demons.  With no other choice, Abel vows to save his daughter, no matter what the cost - even if it is his own humanity...

Majyuuou is a side-scrolling platformer for the Super Nintendo, taking influences from Castlevania and Contra. You play as Abel, intent on rescuing his daughter from the depths of Hell. As you defeat certain bosses, they will drop large, color changing gems. Pick up the gem, and you'll transform into either a red Harpy, a blue Dragon, or a green Lizard, depending on what color it is when you pick it up. Each demon type has its own special attacks.</desc>

	<desc>The Ghost Prime Minister is holding a fighting tournament, and 14-year-old Hikari Tsurugino, the second Mighty Makendo, must face off against all sort of strange apparitions.

Makeruna! Makendo 2 is a comical VS fighting game with an eclectic cast of characters including a soccer player, a zombie, a musclebound mer-man, and a giant robot. Bouts are best two-out-of-three, and each character has both a life bar and a "Makendo" meter, which lets each character perform a variety of special attacks. The game includes a story mode and a 2-player versus mode.</desc>

	<desc>This is the Spirit Forest. Within these woods lives a sprite, and those who meet it find happiness, or so the tale goes. One day, Mario came to the woods to confirm the legend. Peach and Yoshi should have been together with Luigi......but alas, the visage of Luigi was missing. Mario's group of three have separated to find lost little Luigi.

At once, the suspicious sound of an engine was in the air. I wonder what it could be? It was Wario riding his personal plane, the Bulldog, and it dropped a bucket from the sky.

"Whew, woosh!"

And suddenly, the bucket was a snug fit on Mario's head.

"Uwagh, I can't see in this thing!"

The sprite of the woods, Wanda, witnessed it. The petite pixie did not have the strength to remove the bucket on her own, but she desired to help somehow. Thus, Wanda sends Mario a signal with her magic wand, determined to reunite him with Luigi......</desc>

	<name>Mazinger Z</name>
	<desc>Dr. Hell's robot army has destroyed Tokyo, and now only Kouji Kabuto, and the giant robot Mazinger Z, can stop them from taking over the entire world. Animated cutscenes between levels tell the story of the game.

The Mazinger Z comes with a full armory of anti-robot weaponry, from super-powered karate moves to missiles, Breast Fire, and its signature Rocket Punch. Special moves deplete a regenerating energy meter, while Rocket Punches can be preformed at any time, although Mazinger will be unable to punch until its arms return. Each level contains several varieties of enemies, all of them from the show and unique to each level, that must be defeated to progress. Some enemy robots will fire projectiles from a distance while others will rush in attempt to grapple the Mazinger, and sometimes more than one enemy must be fought at once. Enemies will drop healing items and occasionally an item that upgrades Mazinger's Rocket Punch to the Iron Cutter for a limited time. At the end of each level is a fight with a stronger boss robot with more dangerous attacks.</desc>

	<name>Metal Max Returns</name>
	<desc>This is a remake of the game Metal Max, originally for NES. You are a little boy who lives with his father in a town in a futuristic world dominated by machines. Your wish is to become a "hunter" - to kill monsters that roam the world and to receive rewards for that. The storyline and the gameplay basics remained unchanged in this remake. You fight enemies in turn-based combat, and use vehicles, such as your own personal tank Mosquito, to transport yourself through different areas, and to participate in battles. You can also buy equipment and upgrade your vehicles.

The remake features enhanced graphics and sound, background pictures for battles (they were black in the original), slightly different locations (more houses in towns, sometimes different layout of the towns and of the world map), and reduced difficulty level.</desc>

Miracle Girls is based on the characters of the manga and anime of the same name. The player starts the game by picking either Tomomi or Mikage, although they both have the same abilities. Either can jump or toss candy, which will render enemies harmless for a few seconds as they eat it. Enemies incapacitated in this way can be used as platforms. Hidden in levels are bombs that fill the screen with candy, turning any onscreen enemies into heart rings, fruit that increase health, and doors that lead to a celestial slot machine that can reward additional lives. At the end of each level is a different challenge with a boss, such as a top-down squirt-gun fight or a game of matching cards.</desc>

	<name>Monstania</name>
	<desc>The hero of the game is Fron, a sixteen-year old boy who lives on the island of Monstania. One day, strolling in the forest, he notices a strange light. The light lead him to a clearing, and then suddenly disappeared. But Fron realized what was the meaning of that light - it was a fairy! Of course, everybody knew that fairies had been long extinct, but Fron never believed in that. All his life he wanted to meet a real fairy, and now, when the opportunity has come, he firmly decides to find her. His girlfriend Tia helps him on the dangerous journey, during which they meet a mysterious little girl named Chitta, and get involved in a grand adventure, that will ultimately lead them to the battle against the dark force that threatens the whole Monstania!

"Monstania" has a somewhat unusual gameplay within the frames of console RPGs. You don't explore the world in the game: it is entirely linear and takes you to the next destination by itself (only at a few points you can choose where to go next by selecting an appropriate answer). Once within the location, you cannot leave it until you complete all your objectives there, which then take you to the next location. The objective is usually a large strategic battle. You navigate your party members on the battle field, attack with melee and long-ranged weapons, and use special technique which require action points. Unlike most other turn-based strategy games, an enemy makes a move immediately after you did the same with one of your characters, without waiting for the "enemy turn". The RPG element is not very significant: your characters level up automatically after each battle. There are also some puzzles to solve in certain locations.</desc>

	<name>Mystic Ark</name>
	<desc>Seven heroes from seven different Worlds. Seven heroes who were brought to a mysterious temple on a remote island and transformed into statues. Seven heroes who are chosen to bring harmony back to the universe: Miriene the witch (wizard), Lux the tetsujin (a race of iron people), Reeshina the grappler (monk), Tokio the ninja, Kamio the ogre, and Mesia the priestess. The seventh hero is you, the protagonist of the game - the knight Remeer or the female warrior Ferris. Your first task will be to release your companions from the statues they are locked in. You must travel to the Cat World and to retrieve an important artifact. But your main objective is to visit all the seven Worlds and to find seven mystic arks - the items that will re-unite those Worlds and bring peace to them.

"Mystic Ark" is a RPG closely connected to 7th Saga. You travel on overworld map, visit towns, buy equipment, and descend into dungeons. The combat is turn-based and viewed from a third-person "over-the-shoulder" perspective. The battles are not random: the enemies can be seen as white dots on your radar, and if you don't want to fight, you can sometimes outrun or avoid them. The game also contains elements of pure adventure: often you must investigate objects closely and use items from your inventory on them.</desc>

	<name>Nekketsu Tairiku: Burning Heroes</name>
	<desc>The young fighter Ryu was thrown out of his father's home, and this childhood trauma has been dominating his life ever since. His only wish is to surpass his father and to show him he has become a better fighter than him. Laila is a cheerful treasure hunter. She dreams only of valuable things, adventure, travels, and life in the capital city.  Gaou is experiencing a personal tragedy: he wants to discover the mystery of the disappearance of a woman he loved, Asuka, aided by his best friend Froz. Naaga is a girl who wears a heavy armor, which - as she thinks - will prevent her from losing any battle. At present, she has problems since she owes a million gold pieces to her guild. What do those heroes have in common? As their ways cross, they will find out they are in fact pursuing one and the same goal...

"Burning Heroes" lets you start as either one of the four characters. Each one starts in a different place and is seemingly absorbed in his/her personal quest, but as the game progresses, the four heroes meet each other. You should also find and "unlock" four other playable characters as you advance in the game. The gameplay system of "Burning Heroes" is similar to other console-style RPGs: you fight random enemies and bosses in turn-based combat, viewed from third-person perspective, like in Final Fantasy games. As you get hit in a battle, your "passion" (literally "hot blood", nekketsu in Japanese) level rises, and the more damage you take, the quicker you reach 100%. Once the passion bar is full, you can summon a powerful monster and to unleash a devastating attack on the entire enemy party.</desc>

	<name>Neugier: Umi to Kaze no Kodo</name>
	<desc>You play a man named Duke, the son of Count Wein of Neugier. Long time ago, Duke was exiled from the country by his father. Traveling in faraway lands, Duke heard that his homeland was under attack. He decided to return to Neugier. On the way his ship was attacked by pirates, lead by a mysterious demon named Ord. After he barely escaped the ship, Duke found his way into his father's castle. He realized now that the pirates' attack and the monsters roaming the castle are connected. Although his father doesn't trust him, Duke is determined to save Neugier.

"Neugier" is an action adventure game in which you fight enemies in real-time, slashing them with your melee weapon. You have a "throw chain" ability, which allows you to press objects to the walls, destroying them. You can also push enemies to the walls this way. Duke can also jump and equip armor you find sometimes in dungeons.

	<name>Ou-chan no Oekaki Logic</name>
	<desc>Ou-chan no Oekaki Logic is a digital conversion, with anime mascots, of the classic Japanese newspaper puzzle nonograms. A nonogram is a puzzle on a square or rectangular grid the object of which is to reveal a hidden picture. Along each row and column there is a number or series of numbers which indicate how many squares will be colored in that row or grid. Example; &amp;quot;5 9 4&amp;quot; would mean there would be sets of five, nine, and four colored squares in the grid, in that order, with at least one blank in between. 

Ou-chan no Oekaki Logic adds a story mode where Ou-Chan, representing the player, competes with other blobby anime characters in finding hidden images in the nonogram grids.</desc>

	<name>Tetris Attack</name>
	<desc>All is not well on Yoshi's Island! The devious king Bowser has cast a spell on the island's inhabitants, turning them into his mindless slaves. Only Yoshi has escaped its effects, and so he must set off to free his friends, and to defeat Bowser and break the spell.

Tetris Attack is a fact-paced action puzzler featuring the colorful cast of characters from Yoshi's Island. A stack of blocks continually rises from the bottom of the screen, and the player controls a cursor which can swap any two blocks horizontally. Make a row or column of three or more and they'll clear, potentially creating combos from new blocks falling to take their place. Combos will send large garbage blocks to your opponent, which must be eliminated by clearing a piece that is touching it, turning it into normal blocks.

The game offers a story mode against the computer, as well as a 2-player versus mode, an endless mode, a timed mode where a certain number of blocks must be cleared, and a puzzle mode where a set arrangement of blocks must be cleared in a specific number of moves. The game is based on the Japan-only title Panel de Pon.</desc>

	<path>./Pipe Dream (Japan).smc</path>
	<name>Pipe Dream</name>
	<desc>Each level of this abstract puzzler challenges the player to set up a network of pipes to allow an unspecified substance known as 'flooz' to flow through as many of those as possible. The pieces are offered in random order, and there are seven different types - straight lines going horizontally or vertically, corners rotating in each of the four directions, and cross-over pieces which carry the flooz straight across horizontally and vertically. Each of these can be entered from either side. When the flooz hits a gap, or a piece which the previous piece can't flow into, the pipe is finished.

Before the flooz starts flowing from its randomly-selected starting position, the player has several seconds to start placing pieces. They can be put down anywhere. However a situation that can often occur is there will be a long and complex piping arrangement set up, yet a gap somewhere remains to be filled. Players are able to replace a piece with another in the same square (to make it easier to flow the flooz that way), but for a slight scoring penalty.

Bonuses are awarded for looping the flooz through both sides of at least 5 cross-over pieces, or passing the flooz through every square on the screen. Later levels have some squares on the grid blocked off, a few gaps in the side-wall (allowing flooz to thread to the other side of the screen). After every four levels there is a bonus game for points, in which the player can only place the pieces in the lowest open space in each column, similarly to the board game of "Connect 4".</desc>

	<name>Popful Mail</name>
	<desc>In this platform action game, you play as a cute bounty hunter known as Popful Mail. While you might think that a cute Anime chick would have no trouble making a living slashing bad guys with her sword, Popful is having a hard time making ends meet.  One day, however, Popful learns about a magician who has gone rogue and has a hefty bounty on his head. So, her adventure begins as Popful fights her way through a new adventure, and makes new friends along the way.

Primarily this is an action game with very slight RPG elements. As you make your way through the plethora of levels, you will have to collect money from slain foes. You use this money in the shops to buy weapons, armor, health, and so on. Also, this game features interaction with many, many characters through both on-screen dialog and fully animated sequences. Some of these characters become playable as you progress through the game.

This release has the same story and general gameplay style as the earlier version, but otherwise was made from scratch, having entirely different graphics, locations, enemies, challenges, etc.</desc>

	<path>./Ranma 1-2 - Akanekodan Teki Hihou (Japan) (Translated En).smc</path>
	<name>Ranma 1/2 : Hidden Treasure of the Crimson Cats</name>
	<desc>The game is based on the animÃ© series Ranma 1/2. It tells the story of the young martial artist Ranma Saotome. Traveling with his father Genma across China, Ranma discovered a cursed spring. When he and his father fell into that spring, they were both transformed: Ranma into a little girl, Genma into a panda bear. Hot water restored them to their original appearance, but whenever they are splashed with cold water, they turn into their "cursed" forms. 

The story of the game begins as Ranma and Genma are having breakfast by their friends. Suddenly, several cat-like creatures burst in and kidnap Genma. Ranma finds out that the cats belonged to Akaneko (Crimson Cat) Gang, who kidnaps strong fighters for some reason. Soon Ranma discovers that Kamusaru, the leader of the Crimson Cat Gang, is looking for an ancient treasure that will allow him to turn into a Nekomaou (Cat Demon King), and take over the world. Ranma and his friends will do anything to rescue Genma and to stop Kamusaru's evil plans!

The game features many characters from the animÃ©, including Ranma's fiancee Akane, the fighter Ryouga, the amazon warrior Shampoo who is in love with Ranma, and others. The game is built like a traditional Japanese RPG: your party fights random enemies in turn-based combat viewed from a third-person, Final Fantasy-like perspective. In battles, you can attack physically, or use various offensive and defensive techniques, which consume "ki" (an equivalent of magic points). Not only Ranma and Genma, but also the other characters in your parties can take a different shape. You carry around a bucket of cold water, and every time you use it on one of your characters, he/she is transformed into a "cursed" form. This is sometimes required to advance the story of the game (for example, Ranma can enter a certain location only as a girl).

	<name>Ranma 1/2 : Hard Battle</name>
	<desc>Another fighting game based on the Ranma 1/2 manga series set around the misadventures of a martial artist that gets cursed and magically transforms into a female version of himself whenever he's splashed with water.

As in previous games the premise simply involves the cast of the series going at each other's throats for ultimate supremacy, although this time you can select any character in either the single player or Vs gameplay modes.

The gameplay itself involves controlling your character in a side-scrolling arena and trying to defeat your opponent either with your basic attacks, special moves (triggered by specific controller motions) or super moves that require you to charge buttons and can only be dealt under specific situations (ie, when your life-bar starts flashing), while avoiding your opponent's attacks in turn.

	<name>Ranma 1/2 : Chougi Ranbu Hen</name>
	<desc>A 2D one-on-one fighting game based on the Ranma 1/2 manga series dealing with the adventures of a male martial artist cursed to transform into a female version of himself when splashed with water.

Ranma 1/2 : Chougi Ranbu Hen pits 12 characters from the series (including the male and female versions of Ranma) against each other in best 2-out-of-3 rounds matches, with the goal being to defeat all the opponents and thus claim a magical lucky cat that will grant the champion whatever he wishes.

Gameplay involves controlling your character in a 2D scrolling arena, in which you attempt to defeat your opponent by using your basic attacks and special moves, all the while avoiding your opponent's strikes. You can also charge up your character until he reaches "super" mode, which allows you to unleash super moves for extra damage, but performing any basic attack negates the super mode.

Features the standard single player and Vs modes along with a Tag Team Vs mode in which two players select a pair of characters and can exchange them in mid-fight for strategic advantage.</desc>

	<name>Ranma 1/2 : Ougi Jaanken</name>
	<desc>The game involves falling blocks of hands displaying the rock, paper, and scissors signs, which fall three at a time. In a similar manner to Tetris, the player can rotate the blocks to stack them, using pieces that defeat other pieces (e.g. paper over rock) to eliminate stacks. Doing so adds garbage pieces onto the opponent's screen to make it more difficult for them to eliminate their stacks of blocks. The objective is to fill up the opponent's screen up with blocks so that additional ones can no longer fit. Each character has two special attacks which can be used when large combinations are completed. Once in each round each player can also use a bucket of water that can transform a cursed character into their alternate form, which weakens their attacks until the effect wears off. This does not affect Akane or the Gambling King.</desc>

	<desc>Multidirectionally scrolling action shooter. The main character runs through science fiction scenarios blasting away everything that moves. Starting with only a single shot,  5 different upgradable weapon systems can be collected as extras. Upon death, the last activated system loses one increment of its current upgrade status, but can be refueled by additional extras collected. Every weapon has also a massive 'smart' bomb feature, wiping out mostly everything on screen at once if invoked. There are also some R-Type style space shooter levels thrown in for good measurement. Very arcady with tons of action. Several boss monsters per level. Level progress is saved via password feature.

But remember, Dr. Wily is mad, but he's not stupid. He had a backup plan...and all he had to do was just wait...

6 months had passed, and somewhere from deep within Wily's abandoned lab, 4 hidden capsules activated and opened. His backup plan was in action...he had hidden 4 new Wily Robots that would spring him out of jail so he could continue his mad reign.

When Mega Man hears the word that Wily was busting out of prison, he rushes onto the scene, only to encounter a strange robot he had never seen before named Bass. Bass tells Mega Man to back off, that he would stop Wily, and that Mega Man was no longer needed.

Think that's gonna stop Mega Man? No way! Mega Man takes off to put a stop to Dr. Wily and find out exactly whose side Bass is on...</desc>

	<path>./Romancing SaGa (Japan) [En by Trans Dimension v0.40] (Incomplete).smc</path>
	<name>Romancing SaGa</name>
	<desc>Once upon a time, three evil gods fought against the holy gods, and the holy God-Father chose a human warrior to help them. Finally, after a prolonged, terrible war, the leader of the three evil gods - Death, the eldest of them - surrendered. The youngest evil god, Schirach, became a human and has lost her powers. The middle one, Saruin, was sealed away in the dark world. Now, after thousand years have passed, and the seal of Saruin has weakened, it is time for you, the hero of the new generation, to defeat him.

Romancing SaGa is the fourth installment in the long SaGa series - non-linear role-playing games with several main heroes. It is the first of three Super Nintendo entries. The first three games in the series were on the Gameboy and were known as "Final Fantasy Legend" outside of Japan. In this game, you play the stories of eight characters, which will later unite to face the ultimate evil. The eight characters belong to different classes and have different abilities. There are four male characters (noble son, thief, adventurer, and pirate), and four female ones (nomad, ranger, dancer, and savage). The combat is turn-based, with enemies visible on screen. Taking a cue from Final Fantasy II on the NES, instead of "Leveling" your character as a whole you level specific abilities such as a type of weapon or magic, as well as, stats such as HP and Strength and Intelligence. New to this entry abilities are randomly unlocked during battle as a light-bulb appears over the characters head and the new ability is unleashed to the surprise of friend and foe. This serendipitous element of gameplay along with the multiple heroes to choose from greatly enhance the replay value as no two playthroughs are alike. Which is good considering the steep learning curve of the SaGa games which require multiple playthroughs to truly master the system.

"Romancing SaGa" was never released outside of Japan until the Playstation 2 remake "Romancing SaGa: Minstrel Song"</desc>

	<desc>Every 300 years the Death Eclipse kills all newly born creatures. Men, women, and children, animals and plants, even ferocious monsters - no one can survive the devastation caused by the Eclipse. No one except a child chosen by the destiny. 600 years ago, such a child survived the Death Eclipse, only to become a demon king. During the next Eclipse, a chosen child became a holy king, and he defeated the evil demon king. Now, when the next Eclipse is nearing, nobody knows who the next fortunate survivor will become - a demon or a holy man?

In "Romancing SaGa 3", you can play through the story controling any one of the eight main characters - Julian, Monica, Mikhael, Harid, Katarina, Thomas, Elena, and Sarah. The story is common for all eight characters, and they often join together and share the same piece of a story. The princess Monica learns about a rebellion planned by a treacherous Baron to dethrone her brother, Marquis Mikhael. She goes to warn him, but on her way, she loses her horse, and has to stop in an inn of the town Shinnon. There, she meets travelers who agree to lend her a horse and accompany her to see her brother. When they finally reach Mikhael, a war begins...

"Romancing SaGa 3" has a refined upgrading system: you can upgrade your weapons and your spells by using them continuously. The party combat is turn-based, and there are also strategic army-vs.-army battles you'll have to command.</desc>

	<name>Rudra no Hihou</name>
	<desc>The Earth is ruled by heavenly powers, who destroy it and create it again every 4000 years, to end the live of powerful races and to let new ones appear. Many years ago, four great races dominated the Earth: the wise Danans, the beautiful Mermaids, the proud Reptiles, and the strong Giants. But those races had to give place to a newly born race: the humans. During the era of the humans, the planet's air has become filled with smog and the water dirty with pollutants. The cult of the Rudra have appeared and begun fortelling the end of the world. As the 4000 year deadline approaches, three characters each embark on their separate yet intertwined quests.

Sion is a young warrior who wants to take part in a ritual tournament and become the strongest of the kingdom. However a capture of one of the Cultists of Rudras soon complicates his training.

Surlet is a wise magician who is interested in archeology and history of the Earth. He is also a pupil of the famous professor Muench who recently made a very important discovery regarding ancient ruins

Riza is a young druid who lives with her grandfather in a quiet village. She was born with a mysterious jade on her forehead, and now feels the urge to save the world from an inevitable, yet unknown disaster.

Rundra no Hiho is a turn-based RPG, similar in gameplay and graphics to the better known Final Fantasy VI. Whenever players load the game cartridge, they are able to choose which of the three characters they wish to play. This allows any one of these quests to be saved and put aside for any amount of time, allowing the player to change between characters as they so desire. Regardless of which character is chosen, the game is displayed as a top-view on the overworld and in towns. Players can move around to different locations, search treasure chests and talk to townspeople. On the overworld and in dungeons, random encounters can occur. During battles the game is displayed from a side-view and is turn-based between the player's characters and monsters. Players are able to Fight with their weapon, use mantras (magic), use items, defend or run away. Defeat of monsters will result in the party earning experience points and money, which can be spent to buy new weapons, armor and items.

The game's mantra (magic) system is unique in that all spells are formed up of syllables, each with it's own effect (for instance, the syllable "Ig" represents fire and the syllable "ga" augments any mantra's power over it's basic form. Therefore "Igga" is a more powerful version than "Ig" alone). Syllables must be arranged in proper combinations in order to form effective magic spells. Hints towards some of these combinations can be found inside treasure chests or by talking to townspeople.

	<name>Seiken Densetsu 3</name>
	<desc>Seiken Densetsu 3 is set in the same world as the two previous Seiken Densetsu games (the first is Final Fantasy Adventure, and the second is most known as Secret of Mana). The mysterious power of Mana is also the center of all events in Seiken Densetsu 3. Years have passed, and all the destructive powers of Mana have been securely sealed by Mana Swords into eight seeds, all placed in eight different kingdoms. But some people know about those sealed powers, and they don't want to free them for the sake of humanity, but for their own gain - such as the kingdom of Altena, which is slowly freezing and which can be saved only by the legendary powers.

The game features several plot lines connected to each other by their common background. In the beginning of the game, you are offered to choose a group of three among six different characters of different classes: Duran the Fighter, Angela the Magic User, Lisa the Amazon, Carlie the Cleric, Kevin the Grappler and Hawk the Thief. Each one of them has her/his own background story and dwells in a different land. Gradually, the connections between those different characters become apparent, and the seemingly loose story lines are connected into a whole.

Seiken Densetsu 3, like the previous game of the series, is an action RPG, with real time combat.</desc>

	<desc>A 2D side-scrolling beat 'em up, Sengoku casts you and a friend as two renegade fighters out to beat the crap out of the many assorted gangs that threaten the post-apocalyptic cities of the future. Unfortunately for them they also get caught in a time-warping scheme caused by the evil Nobunaga who attempts to invade the time period with mythical warriors and evil creatures from the Japanese sengoku period.

The game thus takes you from the city to a spirit-realm from time to time, in which you must fight all sorts of Japanese mythical figures, and release three haunted spirits that can aid you in your battle. Collecting orbs from defeated enemies allows you heal up, gain weapons and even energy attacks and also summon the warrior forms of the spirits you released, which change your character's form and give you a new collection of attacks and powers.

	<name>Shin Megami Tensei</name>
	<desc>A young man lives together with his mother in Kichijoji, a district in modern Tokyo. One day, he has a strange dream: he is being sucked into another dimension, a strange maze-like structure. A spirit appears in front of him and asks him his name. As he proceeds further, he meets a man who is hanging on a cross, another one who is being tormented by a demon, and a mysterious young woman who is bathing in a pool...

"Wake up!" - the voice of his mother cuts through the dream. The young man wakes up and checks his computer. Suddenly, a message arrives: the world is headed towards destruction. Only he who can summon demons through a virtual space will be able to prevent a disaster. What could that mean? The young man goes outside and finds out a murder has occurred in the nearby park. The district must be cut off from the rest of the city until the murderer is found. This was the beginning of the demon summoner's story...

"Shin Megami Tensei" is a first-person RPG set in modern-day and futuristic Tokyo. The hero of the game can summon demons, who use a mysterious energy called Magnetite. The demons can fight for you and perform other useful tasks. The first-person combat is turn-based. In the beginning of the game, you can set the statistics of your party members, determining their strength, stamina, intelligence, etc. You'll need to make some crucial decisions during the game, that will also influence the outcome of its events.</desc>

	<name>Shin Megami Tensei II</name>
	<desc>Shin Megami Tensei II is a direct sequel to the  first game. The events of this game take place 20 or 30 years after the hero of the first game followed the neutral path, defeated the Asura Lord and the seraph Michael at the Cathedral, and founded a state where followers of both Law and Chaos ideals could live freely. But his reign of freedom doesn't last long. The Mesia faith gains power, expanding the Cathedral into a new enclosed environment named Millenium. The Gaians rise up, but their rebellion is repressed by the Mesians' elite warrior class, the Temple Knights. Some years later, a retired arena fighter Okamoto discovers a man fighting for his life against a demon. He rescues the man, who doesn't even remember his own name, and trains him to fight in the arena so they might both go on to a better living in one of the upper-class areas of Millenium. And thus the new battle for a better future begins...

"Shin Megami Tensei II" features all the gameplay innovations of the previous game. You can summon demons, fuse them, make them battle for you, talk to random enemies and receive information from them, etc. The combat is turn-based, and you explore the dungeons from a first-person perspective view.</desc>

	<name>Shin Nekketsu Kouha Kunio-kun: Kunio-tachi no Bank</name>
	<desc>Another beat 'em up in the Nekketsu Kouha Kunio-Kun series. 
The eternal rebel Kunio and his pal Riki finally get to face the long arm of the law when they get both arrested for killing a couple of bystanders in a hit-and-run incident. Problem is they are innocent and the lookalike killers are still out there! Kunio and his pal now have to break out of the prison and go kick some butt in the name of justice (and to clear their names of course).

Gameplay involves defeating all opponents using your arsenal of attacks and special moves (as well as any weapons you may find around) and completing the many side scrolling stages that make up the game, usually after beating an end level boss.

Kunio and Riki are not alone in their quest, as their hard boiled girlfriends, Misako and Kyouko, can join up and provide their unique collection of special moves to the mix. Biking sequences in which you try to get to another part of town while fending-off opponents Road Rash-style are also added for additional gameplay and the game uses several non-interactive cutscenes and dialogues to carry the plot forward.</desc>

	<desc>Shounen Ashibe: Goma-chan no Yuuenchi Daibouken (lit: "Boy Ashibe: Goma-chan's Great Amusement Park Adventure") is a Super Famicom platformer from Nova Co. and Takara. The player alternates between controlling the human Ashibe, as he escorts his friends across a world map while talking to NPCs and following the game's story, and the seal Goma-chan in 2D platformer stages where he must track down eight items by investigating his surroundings thoroughly. While Goma-chan can't be hurt by enemies, colliding with them causes him to lose one of the eight items he's already found - as the stages have a strict time limit, it's best to avoid this situation whenever possible.

Shounen Ashibe was originally a Shounen Jump serialized manga before becoming an anime TV series in 1991, a year before this game was released.</desc>

	<name>Shounen Ninja Sasuke</name>
	<desc>Shounen Ninja Sasuke ("Boy Ninja Sasuke") is a comedic brawler published by SunSoft exclusively for the Super Famicom. The player, as the eponymous ninja, must rescue the daughter of a local lord by fighting his way through hordes of masked bandits led by a mysterious warlord. A second player can join in as Sasuke's monk friend Chin-nan. The game has a distinct sense of speed and verticality, and it's recommended that the player(s) try running and jumping around performing aerial attacks rather than staying on the ground and getting quickly swarmed by enemies.The game was published by SunSoft and developed by an unknown developer, though Mint is thought to have contributed to its sound design. A US SNES localization, with the title Boy Ninja Sasuke, was briefly considered but then axed.</desc>

	<path>./Slayers (Japan) (Translated En).smc</path>
	<name>Slayers</name>
	<desc>"Slayers" is based on an manga series of the same name (also known as Lina the Teenage Sorceress). The heroine of the manga (and of the game) is Lina Inverse, a seventeen-year-old girl who can use magic and is also proficient with the sword. Lina particularly likes money, and often robs rich people and hunts for treasure. She also has a sense for justice - if a village or a town is in trouble, Lina will do anything to protect it and to fight the bad guys! In the game, Lina is knocked down after a fight against mysterious attackers, and is found by the inhabitants of the nearby village. The trouble is, she can't remember anything! When she meets her long-time companion Naga, their first objective become to investigate the goblin attacks on the population, but Lina's ultimate quest is to regain her memory and to find out who or what has attacked her.

The game is a traditional console-style RPG with towns, dungeons, random enemies, and turn-based combat viewed from first-person perspective, in a Dragon Warrior fashion. The characters can attack physically or use special attacks. Lina can also cast various magical spells. You cannot travel on the world map, but "jump" to various locations instead. The game features animé-style cut scenes.</desc>

	<desc>The game is a less of a self-contained game and more a collection of four smaller ones; including a point-and-click segment featuring Schroeder. The player controls Woodstock and direct Snoopy as he performs all sorts of errands for different Peanuts characters. The player does a separate game for each character; some of them require him to do a little detective work, or to direct Snoopy to win a race, or to get a character to some place. The ultimate goal in the game is to get everyone in shape for Snoopy's concert. Games can either be played using stereo or monoaural sound.

The music was composed by Hirokazu Tanaka (?????)[2] and Minako Hamano (??????),[2] in addition to arrangements of the familiar works of Vince Guaraldi known to longtime Peanuts fans. Many years later the game has been translated to English (by Aeon Genesis) and Portuguese.</desc>

	<desc>A puzzle spin-off title from the Ganbare Goemon series. Goemon has been captured and his friend Ebisumaru goes out to try to find and rescue him. In order to do so, he must traverse a series of maze-like levels avoiding obstacles and enemies and get to the end zone.

The game is played from an isometric perspective from which you can get a good view of the mazes and Ebisumaru. You have no direct control of Ebisumaru per se, but instead switch special blocks around the mazes that can change Ebisumaru's direction of travel and such. You must reach the end of each stage before time runs out, and get all the power-ups and items laid in each maze in hopes of getting to Goemon alive.</desc>

	<name>Super Bomberman 4</name>
	<desc>The fourth addition to the Bomberman series for the SNES.  This game is almost identical to Super Bomberman 3 only with new levels and a new story.

A small twist in this game is that instead of choosing the traditional bomberman or a country specific character players get to choose between bosses from the previous game when playing battle mode. Each character has a special power from a jet pack to throwing abilities.</desc>

	<desc>The fifth and final Bomberman released for the SNES (so far).  This game is very similar to Super Bomberman 3 and 4.  Again there is a new story and new battle arenas but other than that it is the same game.  Players choose between the bosses of the story game levels in battle games like in Super Bomberman 4 yet they have not special powers this time around.</desc>

	<name>Super Fire Pro Wrestling - Queen's Special</name>
	<desc>Long before the WWE introduced the Divas wrestling matches, in Japan there was a more serious affair, where wrestling skill was more important than breast implants, and matches were "real" (as far as wrestling goes) instead of pillow-fighting or bra and panties fights.

In this game in the Fire Pro Series, the cast of the All Japan Women's Pro-Wrestling promotion are available, all fighting to win the Red belt, the highest prize of the federation. It's also possible to fight in single matches, tournaments, Battle Royal and Elimination matches. The usual array of options in CAW is present, being possible to create 16 new Wrestlers.

Gameplay, as usual is the series, is dramatically different than in most western games. Each wrestler has a bunch of moves, ranked from weak to strong. While it's possible to connect any of them from open situations, while grappling only when the opponent is already beaten the most powerful moves can be successfully used.

	<name>Super Fire Pro Wrestling Premium X</name>
	<desc>In this final appearance of Fire Pro series on 16-bit consoles, the usual roster of over 150 wrestlers from several wresting promotions worldwide including several styles from Shoot or Pancrase to American and Lucha are joined by 80 Create-a-wrestler slots, plus secret wrestlers such as legends Gotch or Thesz or the roster of Blazing Tornado. While all fighters have fictional names, a lot of them are perfectly recognizable by their attire, stance and style. The CAW mode allows the player to create a wrestler from scratch, setting how they look (choosing face, size, clothing and setting colours) and fight, with several styles and stances available, as well as over 500 moves, each more suitable for certain styles and skills. To make them fight more realistically when controlled by the AI, the CAW mode also allows one to set move priorities.

Five game modes are available, including World Championship (single and tag), Battle Royale, 5-man Elimination Mode, League Battle and the One Night Dream Match. There are several referees available (each with their own quirks) and variant rules, from allowing fighting outside the ring without count-out (or disallowing it) to the disabling of disqualifications from illegal moves.</desc>

Tubes of random shapes drop on to a board, and by rotating and placing them you have to make shapes that join up in loops. Once you have placed a piece you can't remove it, except by using a special items which destroy every part of an incomplete loop it touches; every tenth loop takes you to a new level.</desc>

	<path>./Super Nazo Puyo - Rulue no Roux (Japan).smc</path>
	<name>Super Nazo Puyo - Rulue no Roux</name>
	<desc>A spin-off of the successful action puzzle series Puyo Puyo with a twist. Whereas the main Puyo Puyo games are aimed at defeating AI or human controlled opponents in puzzle duels (where each player has his own play area in which color-coded "puyos" fall and must clear them out faster than his opponent). Nazo Puyo instead challenges the player with different single-player scenarios in which a specific objective must be completed (such as clearing only the red Puyos, or performing a specific sequence of combos, etc.).

The game uses the mold of a top-down RPG in which you control the young magician Arle as she explores towns and dungeons in her search for adventure. Each quest involves finding an NPC who will trigger one of the aforementioned scenarios and rewards Arle with experience points and unique items that increase her stats.

	<desc>Sequel to the original Super Nazo Puyo, SNP2 is a Puyo Puyo spin-off which combines arcade puzzle elements with RPG gameplay.

You play as the young magician Arle as she sets out looking for adventure all over the land, chatting with NPCs and exploring the game world via a standard top-down RPG interface. Quests involve careful exploration and solving Nazo Puyo challenges which involve specific scenarios of puzzle-based gameplay which the player must solve under a specific timeframe. These sequences give the player a play area in which color-coded "puyos" are pre-arranged in different patterns, and the player must position and arrange the ones that start to fall in order to fullfil the objective at hand (clear only a certain row or color of puyos, reach a certain number of combos, etc.). Additionally, running into specific monsters can trigger standard Puyo Puyo duels, in which both players have their own play areas and the objective is to clear the screen faster than the opponent.

	<desc>Super Sokoban (or Soukoban) is a puzzle game in which the player must push crates around a maze to their designated storage area, ensuring they do not accidentally push a crate into a position where it cannot be recovered. Thinking Rabbit created the original game in 1982 on home computers, and Super Sokoban is the first Super Famicom game to follow the same blueprint.

The intro establishes that the eponymous Sokoban, or warehouse worker, must perform enough box-pushing puzzles to earn enough cash for a flashy new car so that he might finally impress the girl of his dreams.

An added wrinkle is that each stage has a fixed move limit, and so the player must not only push the boxes in the right order but do so with maximum efficiency. The game was not released outside of Japan.</desc>

	<name>Super Tetris 2 + Bombliss</name>
	<desc>Super Tetris 2 + Bombliss is one of the many versions of the famous soviet puzzle game, the first one available for the Super Nintendo, and an updated version of Tetris 2 + Bombliss.

As the title would suggest, the game features both standard Tetris as well as another similar game called Bombliss. Tetris offers three game modes: standard marathon (A-type), start with garbage (B-type), and rising garbage (C-type). There is also a two-player versus mode where clearing rows sends garbage to the other player.

Bombliss is slightly different from normal Tetris. Arranged on the board and in some dropped pieces are bomb squares. Completing a row does not clear the blocks in the row, but will trigger any bombs in the row which will destroy blocks. Different sizes of bombs will generate larger explosions. Bombliss is offered in standard marathon mode, a puzzle mode where a set board must be cleared using set piece drops, and a 2-player versus mode.</desc>

	<name>Super Tetris 3</name>
	<desc>Super Tetris 3 is yet another version of the famous soviet puzzle game. However, despite what the title may suggest, contained within are actually four different versions of Tetris: Tetris Classic, Familiss, Sparkliss, and Magicaliss. Tetris Classic, of course, is the basic version of the game, which comes with an endless mode and a 25-line "standard" mode. Familiss, as the name might suggest, is a family mode for up to four players simultaneously. Sparkliss, meanwhile, is very similar to Bombliss from Super Tetris 2, only with a medieval fantasy theme and different explosion patterns. Sparkliss includes both a stage mode and a puzzle mode.

The most unique mode is Magicaliss, which has never shown up on any other version of Tetris. In Magicaliss, pieces come in three basic colors, and by rotating the piece, the player can choose between them. Creating a line entirely out of one color will clear all blocks on the screen of that color. There are also grey pieces, which can only be cleared by creating a line made entirely from one color, which will cause all grey blocks on screen to become that color. There are also rare rainbow pieces which will act as any color. Besides these additions, the game itself is basic Tetris.

Tetris Classic, Sparkliss, and Magicaliss can also be played in a two-player battle mode, besides the four-player Familiss mode.</desc>

	<name>Tales of Phantasia</name>
	<desc>In "Tales of Phantasia", you play a young boy named Cless, who lives together with his parents in a quiet village. It was a day like all the others when Cless decided to go hunting with his best friend Chester. Chasing a wild boar, Cless discovered a strange talking tree in the forest who was pleading him for help. But as soon as it stopped speaking, the two friends heard the sound of an alarm. They returned to the village and found it burnt down, and all its inhabitants murdered. Before Cless' mother died in his arms, she told him this terrible massacre had something to do with the pendant she and her husband gave Cless for his birthday... what connection could there be? Cless decides to visit his uncle who lives in another town, but he doesn't realize his journey will take him to much more remote places than that!

"Tales of Phantasia" presents a unique combat system: The battles have a lot in common with fighting games: you fight on a platform that slowly scrolls forward and have to attack your enemy in real time. Other party members are controlled by AI. You can pause the game at any time and use magic, items, or choose an overall strategy for your allies.</desc>

	<name>Tenchi Muyou ! Game-Hen</name>
	<desc>Sasami is kidnapped by a mysterious little girl with magical powers, and Tenchi and his companions must travel to rescue her, battling monsters and other creatures on the way.

Tenchi Muyou! Game-Hen is a strategy game with RPG elements, based on the popular Japanese Tenchi Muyo! cartoon series. The game moves from battle to battle, with the plot being revealed through cutscenes between them. The player fights the computer on turns, controlling the individuals from a party of four. The party members are selected on a separate screen before each battle, and as the game progresses new characters become available.

During the skirmish, selecting the characters brings up a menu with three command options: move, attack or end turn. A fourth transform option becomes available later, after they reach a higher level. When moving or attacking, glowing tiles on the ground show the maximum range of the action. Performing either one costs action points, shown as eight regenerating green dots on the status window, alongside basic statistics like health, defense and attack levels. Characters level up automatically while on the battlefield, increasing their abilities and receiving more powerful attacks. Health powers are also accessed through the attack menu, recovering lost points to an ailing comrade within their range. Characters can transform to a more powerful version when they have the ability to do so, and all the eight green dots are still available. The transformed unit has more powerful attacks and a wider range of movement.

After the battle, a map screen appears where the player can save the game, and choose the next battle from one of the available paths. It is possible to revisit battlegrounds, to level up before tackling stronger enemies.

	<name>Torneko no Daibouken - Fushigi no Dungeon</name>
	<desc>Torneko (aka Taloon) from Dragon Quest IV was a merchant and treasure hunter who always dreamed of owning his own shop. Having defeating the evil along with other heroes, he returned to Endor to work peacefully. Some time has passed and after growing successful in this town, Torneko grew anxious. Hearing rumors one day about a "Mysterious Dungeon", Torneko meets with the king to ask permission to set up a new shop, closer to this Mysterious Dungeon. By exploring this cavern and returning safely with the prizes, Torneko hopes to become the most successful merchant in the world.

Torneko No Daibouken is a overhead view game similar to Hack, what might be called a "dungeon crawl". Torneko must venture into the mysterious dungeon gathering treasure. He may equip any weapons and shields he finds there, as well as gather up items such as spell scrolls, staffs and herbs with a variety of effect. A variety of enemies, familiar to the Dragon Quest series, await him. If Torneko successfully exits the dungeon, he is able to sell any of the items he has collected. This money then goes to improve the quality of his shop and living quarters. As the game progresses, Torneko is able to store special items in the vault, which he is then able to bring with him on subsequent trips to the dungeon.</desc>

	<name>Treasure Hunter G</name>
	<desc>Brothers Red and Blue G. decide to leave their idyllic village in search of their long lost father, who left the kids years ago to go treasure hunting. Unfortunately, as soon as they begin their quest, they become entangled with a mysterious girl on the run from evil monsters who holds the key to the resurrection of a great demon. Now its up to the brothers to save the world if they ever want to find their father.

Treasure Hunter G is a top-down RPG in which you control your party of four characters as they explore the fantasy/sci-fi game world in search for quests and grinding their stats while the plot advances. The game is divided in a world-map screen, a top-down "town" mode and a turn-based fight mode in which the characters are taken to generic tiled top-down arenas in which they select each character and move or attack depending on their action points.

Enemies can be seen on the map instead of jumping at you at random intervals, and you can freely decide whether to engage them or simply circle them around. The game uses a combination of hand-drawn sprites and CGI pre-rendered one (mostly for the main characters) with a distinct cute or Super Deformed design (as usual for most console RPGs).</desc>

	<desc>Uchu no Kishi: Tekkaman Blade's is based on the anime Tekkaman Blade, also known as Teknoman. The game's levels are a mix of scrolling shooter and fighting game. The first part of every level is a scrolling shooter where Tekkaman Blade must survive several waves of Radam before killing two stronger boss-like Radam and meeting another Tekkaman. In scrolling shooter levels Blade can either toss his spear to defeat enemies at range or quickly slash with it to destroy bullets and enemies. One enemy type will drop different colored System Box powerups: green restores health, red destroys all enemies onscreen (except bosses), and blue turns Blade invulnerable and able to destroy all enemies upon contact (including bosses).

The end of every level is a one on one fight with an enemy Tekkaman. Each Tekkaman starts with a weapon, but the weapon will be lost if they take too much damage, forcing them to use punches and kicks. This mode can also be played in 2-player mode, where each player selects their Tekkaman.</desc>

	<name>Wonder project J</name>
	<desc>There was once a great scientist and inventor named Gepetto, who lived on an island farm together with his creations, his robotic helper, the pixie Tinker, and his pet animals. His greatest creation was an artificial boy named Pino. No, he was not carved from wood, but looked just like a real boy - only he could turn his head 360 degrees. But Gepetto was arrested for an unknown reason. The boy Pino looks like a real boy, but he was completed just a few moments ago, and he knows absolutely nothing. All he can do is wander aimlessly, poking objects and turning his head. It is up to you, the player, to make Pino a real man!

In this simulation/role-playing game, you must use the robotic pixie Tinker to educate Pino. You can move Tinker around, examining objects and collecting them in an adventure-like fashion. Pino will automatically follow you to the direction you are facing, but will continue walking until you stop him. He will also pick objects and make his own "experiments" with them. Your goal is to train PIno in various disciplines. His stats can be raised in a RPG style: reading books increases his intelligence, throwing a ball increases his dexterity, and so on. By praising or scolding Pino you will gradually make him understand what should be done and what not.

To play, you move the randomly placed cookies into rows and columns of cookies with similar patterns. When you successfully assemble a row or column of the same cookies, the line will disappear, and you can begin on a new row or column. The "Yoshi" cookie is very special in both the 1-player and the 2-player game. Since the Yoshi Cookie is the key to both games, you must use it wisely.</desc>

	<desc>After having defeated the ultimate evil in his previous adventure, the great hero Adol stands on a sea shore, thinking about the fate of the once peaceful Utopian land of Ys, while the wind is blowing through his red hair. Suddenly, Adol notices a bottle, thrown onto the shore. It contains a letter, written in a foreign language, in which an unknown person asks Adol to come to his land and save it from a mysterious evil. Adol decides to accept the offer, and thus his adventure begins again...

Ys IV: Mask of the Sun is an action RPG with a combat system like the earlier Ys games. An enemy should be rammed from the sides in order to hurt him. If performed incorrectly, the player will get hurt himself. It's also possible to use magic and position oneself strategically in battle so that the enemy won't be able to inflict any damage.

	<desc>YuYu Hakusho is a Super Famicom game based on the horror-themed manga and anime about a belligerent young man who dies unexpectedly from being hit by a car and is revived as a "spirit detective" by the rulers of the afterlife, and it becomes his job to investigate ghostly matters in the mortal world. The game is a series of set-piece battles where two opponents build up gauges using the D-pad and one of the face buttons: each combination leads to a separate attack and requires a different amount of build-up. The player can go through the story mode, which recounts events from the manga, or they can play a "free" mode against opponents of their choice.</desc>

The game casts you as a wrestler of your choice in the official Zen Nippon Pro Wrestling league and pits you against the other featured wrestlers in grappling matches. As in the original you get to pick between several game modes including: Tournament, Championship (single or tag) Vs, Team (with the new 4-player variant) and Training.</desc>

Because the game takes place in the "near future" and it was released in the mid-1990s, the game itself is referring the story of the game to the first decade of the 21st century.

This game received a sequel in the form of Zero4 Champ RR-Z.</desc>

	<path>./Acrobat Mission (Japan).sfc</path>
	<name>Acrobat Mission</name>
	<desc>Years ago humanity abandoned the over-polluted Earth to make a new home on Mars. Now, without warning, a mechanical moon has appeared in the skies over Mars, and is raining down destruction on the colonies. A plan is hastily put into action to destroy the moon and its armada of space-craft. Due to the impossible task of surviving a direct assault, the mission is code-named Acrobat Mission.

Your spaceship in Acrobat Mission is capable of firing a single straight ahead shot. By picking up a Wide upgrade, more shots are added that fly off at an angle, and the shot can be charged up to unleash a continuous short range cone of energy. Picking up a Hurricane upgrade will cause bullets to circle you defensively before shooting forward, and charging will store a full round of bullets up to be fired straight ahead all at once. Up to two bombs can be held at once, and if an enemy bullet hits a bomb it will detonate, saving your ship from damage. If your ship is hit, however, then you will have a few seconds to ram it into whatever shot you and take them down with you. Unlike most scrolling shooter games contact with an enemy ship will not kill you, but they can still push you into the path of bullets.

Play takes place over five levels, first of your launch on Mars, then the approach to the moon, and finally infiltrating the base to destroy its core. Each level ends with a unique boss except stage 4, which ends with 3 bosses.</desc>

	<desc>Past and future are connected in a way mortals do not understand...  A star was glowing up in the sky, and the demon god Alcahest appeared, bringing chaos and destruction to the world. A single swordsman stood in defiance. The four powers that protect the world, the Guardians, gave him their power, and with it the swordsman slew the demon and restored peace in the world. 

Thousand years have passed. And a new battle is already on the way. A cruel emperor leads his troops towards conquest. The kingdom of Panakeia is defending itself with the aid of its knights. Once again, the ominous star shines in the sky, indicating the demon's revival. With the help of Alcahest's power, the evil emperor wants to conquer the world. But the new generation also brings the new hero - the brave swordsman Alen. Aided by the Guardians, Alen must stop the Empire's evil plans and to destroy Alcahest once again.

This is an action game with RPG elements. You wander around slaying enemies in real time combat, gathering treasure on the way, and occasionally participating in boss battles. When you gather enough experience from fighting, you gain extra hit points. You can also upgrade your weapons. On the way you'll meet some characters who will join your party for short time, and you'll be able to use their special attacks and magic.</desc>

Jake is one such pilot, drafted into the Pacific States' Marine Corp under the Federation. During his training, the war has grown substantially and upon being assigned to a platoon, he is immediately thrown into combat.

Cybernator is a side scrolling mech combat game and platform game. The player controls Jake as he moves his assault suit left and right on the battlefield. The assault suit can jump and use a jetpack for a short time to increase altitude. The assault suit begins with a Shot machine gun weapon that spreads out fire in front, and a Punch weapon for close melee. Additional weapons can be found during the course of the game and existing weapons improved by the gathering of "P" power-ups, left by defeated enemy. Each level contains a variety of enemies and an end boss which must be destroyed to reach the next level. Some levels take place as horizontally scrolling shooters, in which the Assault suit can move up, down, left and right on the screen... but is constantly advancing towards new threats.</desc>

The king sends his best troops of knights and wizards to face the enemy, but in vain - the kingdom is conquered by Sauzer, the king is murdered, and his lovely daughter is kidnapped. You were brave, Leader of the Dragon Squad, but now you will have to become strong. Remember the promise you gave the princess long time ago: always to be at her side. Supported by his friends and by his faithful dragons, you must now free the princess and the kingdom from the enemy's hands. If only the strongest of the dragons, Bahamut, could be awakened...

Bahamut Lagoon, created by the company which gave us the Final Fantasy games, is a mixture of turn-based strategy and RPG. Control several parties of four characters each, and command different dragons at once. The battles start on a top-down screen typical for strategy games, but often switch to a dynamic "platform" view, such as used in early console RPGs. You also can influence the game by other strategic activities, such as, for example, setting a whole forest on fire, to prevent enemies to come through it.</desc>

	<name>Bakutou Dochers</name>
	<desc>Bakutou Dodgers is a Japan-only action game for up to four players. It superficially resembles Hudson's Bomberman series, with its top-down grid stages and chaotic gameplay, but rather than leaving bombs and waiting for them to explode, the player can shoot energy at blocks and each other.

The goal is to sneak up behind the opponent and shoot them before they can reciprocate. Various power-ups may appear after destructible blocks are removed, which can give the player an edge or, in the case of the ? icon, a possible random negative effect like reversed controls. There are also wandering monsters that can cause damage to anyone they come in contact with. Every combatant has a health bar which depletes at a rate dependent on the attacks they are getting hit by.

The single-player mode involves fighting through various worlds and removing all enemy combatants from the field to progress.</desc>

To fight whoever flies thar yonder in the distance, you send out projectiles, in our case fireballs. These behave differently depending on which of the four main buttons you press: if you press the A button, they fly in a curve towards the upper right part of the screen, if you push the Y button, they go left and down and so on and so forth. Sadly, they move so slowly your opponent has a good three seconds to get out of the way, and in so weird curves that aiming is impossible. Also, the screen constantly twists in all directions.</desc>

	<desc>Battle Jockey is a racing game for up to four players that was developed by Nova and published by Virgin Interactive exclusively in Japan for the Super Famicom.It features horseracing, a far more popular pastime in Japan than elsewhere, and presents three separate modes: the first is the standard single-player story mode, in which the player takes a horse and jockey through training and races; the second is a battle mode which pits up to four players against each other in races that have far more power-ups and other unusual additions to the game's courses; and the third is a passive gambling mode in which the player puts money down on horses depending on their odds of winning and subsequent payouts and then watches the race play out with CPU players.The standard mode involves carefully managing the horse's stamina: being too aggressive will cause it to rear up in protest. Falling behind or running into a hedge or jump will cause the horse to lose stamina, and losing all stamina causes it to collapse briefly. The player needs to keep a steady pace, steer carefully around corners, jump at the right times and use the boost sparingly in order to win. In the battle mode stamina is less of a concern and the game more resembles RC Pro-Am: the players have to simply follow the course and avoid the dangers as they show up.</desc>

	<path>./Bishoujo Senshi Sailor Moon - Another Story (Japan) (Translated En).sfc</path>
	<name>Sailor Moon : Another Story</name>
	<desc>The game is based on the Japanese manga and animé series Bishoujo Senshi: Sailor Moon - "Bishoujo Senshi" roughly meaning "Pretty Young Girl Warrior". It is set in the 30th century, in a futuristic city Crystal Tokyo. In this city lives a totally ordinary (at first) fourteen-year old girl Usagi. When she meets a magical cat named Luna, she finds out that she is in fact a princess sent to the future in order to fight the minions of Darkness. She discovers within herself the power to transform into the hero of darkness, Sailor Moon, meets other warriors who help her on her quest, and fights the evil Queen Beryl, hostile aliens, and other foes.

The events of this game take place shortly after Bishoujo Senshi Sailor Moon S, the fourth volume of the long-running series. A global peace is established in the universe, but lately suspicious things are happening. A strange meteorite is seen approaching the Earth. Street gangs and spies who work for a mysterious person called Apsu are seen in Crystal Tokyo. And the Mystic Silver Crystal, the Ginzuishou, which protects the city, is shaking! Usagi and her friends must now investigate the strange events and face the forces of Darkness once again.

The game is a console-style RPG in Final Fantasy style (battles with your party to the right and the enemies to the left), with a battle system somewhat similar to that of Chrono Trigger: you must form a party out of several available characters, make them participate in battles together, and learn powerful combo attacks.

	<desc>The game is based on the animé series Sailor Moon. The main character of the series is Tsukino Usagi, a 14-year-old schoolgirl who unexpectedly gets involved in an epic adventure. Luna, a magical talking cat, contacts her and tells her she is in fact a Sailor Moon, one of the legendary Pretty Fighters - girls who fight the forces of darkness and protect the Kingdom of Moon. 

The game is based on the events of the animé that follow the victory of Usagi and her friends over the Queen Beryl. Peace has returned to the Moon Kingdom. But suddenly, a little girl named Chibiusa arrives from the future and says the future kingdom is threatened by the forces of the evil Prince Diamond. Looks like you are the only ones who can defeat him, and save the future Sailor Moon, Chibiusa's mother.

This is a beat-'em up game. You can play as either Usagi or any of her girlfriends, including Chibiusa. You move on a platform and fight the enemies by punching, kicking, and throwing them, and by using special abilities unique to each character. You can advance only after you have cleared an area from enemies.

	<name>Sailor Moon S : Kondo wa Puzzle de Oshioki yo</name>
	<desc>Bishoujo Senshi Sailor Moon S: Kondoha Puzzle de Oshiokiyo is a falling block competitive puzzle game. Players begin by choosing from a selection of Sailor Moon licensed characters, each with a unique special attack. The player is presented with a board filled with colored blocks in three colors: red, blue and green. The goal is to remove all the blocks from play. Clicking on a block that touches several adjacent blocks of the same color will remove them all from play. As each player successfully clears blocks, they drop "black blocks" on their opponent as well as increase their power bar. Black blocks cannot be removed by normal means and disappear only when large ammounts of blocks are removed adjacent to them. As the power bar charges, players can unleash their special ability, often an attack on the other player.

This puzzle game is based on the "S" series of Sailor Moon and includes characters from there: Sailor Moon, Sailor Mars, Sailor Venus, Sailor Mercury, Sailor Jupiter, Chibiusa, Tuxedo Mask, Sailor Uranus, Sailor Neptune and Sailor Pluto.

	<name>Sailor Moon S : Kurukkurin</name>
	<desc>Bishoujo Senshi Sailor Moon S: Kurukkurin is a competitive puzzle game featuring Sailor Moon licensed characters. Upon choosing a character (each with unique "special moves"), the player competes against an opponent. Each player controls a grid of 10x6 sections (represented by hearts) initially made up of clear hearts. The player moves their cursor over the clear hearts to turn them into one of four colors: red, yellow, blue and green. Sometimes "treasures" will show up on the board. When several hearts of the same color are adjacent to one another, the player can clear them... which pushes all the hearts (and treasures) down towards the bottom. The goal is to be the player with the most treasures to end the round.

Sailor Moon characters featured are primarily from the "S" Series and includes: Sailor Moon, Sailor Mars, Sailor Mercury, Sailor Venus, Sailor Jupiter, Chibius, Tuxedo Mask, Sailor Neptune, Sailor Uranus and Sailor Pluto.

	<name>Bishoujo Senshi Sailor Moon Super S - Zenin Sanka!! Shuyaku Soudatsusen</name>
	<desc>The game is based on the manga/animÃ© series Sailor Moon. It tells the story of Pretty Sailor Fighters, teenage girls who were summoned to protect the futuristic Moon Kingdom and to fight the forces of darkness, led by the evil Queen Beryl and Prince Diamond. The main heroine is a girl named Tsukino Usagi, who was contacted by the magical talking cat Luna to become Sailor Moon, the leader of the group.

This fighting game is an enhanced version of Bishoujo Senshi Sailor Moon S: Jougai Ranto!? Shuyaku Soudatsusen. Girls compete against each other in tournament mode, story mode, player-vs.-computer mode, and two players mode. They can use physical attacks and magical spells. In story mode you can also upgrade your fighter's attributes (strength, defense power, etc.) New in this expanded version: additional playable characters (hence the title Zen'in Sanka - "Everyone Participates"), different scenes in story mode, additional backgrounds for battles.

	<name>Brandish 2 : The Planet Buster</name>
	<desc>The Planet Buster continues the story that was told in the first Brandish game, and depicts the events that happened three years after the evil demonic king was defeated in his lost kingdom, sunken deep underground. You take control of a young warrior named Ares, who wields a magical weapon, a powerful sword called the Planet Buster. One day, while traveling through a desert, Ares is captured by a warlock named Karl, who is after the powers hidden within the magical sword. Suspecting Ares might have some valuable information, Karl doesn't execute him, but takes away the Planet Buster and throws Ares into his underground prison. Now your primary goal is to guide Ares out of the huge prison full of various dangers, and to get your mighty weapon back.

The game is an action RPG with a heavy emphasis on dungeon crawling. You guide Ares through rotating dungeons, fighting enemies in real-time combat, casting spells, and solving an occasional puzzle. You have the ability to jump forwards and to attack inanimate objects such as doors to cause damage and to break the object.

	<name>Captain Tsubasa J</name>
	<desc>A 1995 Japan-exclusive Captain Tsubasa video game developed and published by Bandai and was the final Captain Tsubasa game for the Super Famicom.
This game suffered lots of changes from previous games made by Tecmo, this time you will be playing in a real soccer field and in real time, which means that you need to press certain keys even without having the chance of stopping the time (like in previous games), When a certain player is confronted with a one that he considers his rival (like Misugi and Schneider or Tsubasa and *any other player*, for example) they will have a fight, which is mainly a button smashing sequence. The same goes for the sequence in which a goalkeeper tries to stop any of the special shots.
This game has almost the same story as the Captain Tsubasa J anime, except that this one will finish with a special match against an extra team. So, you'll play across various chapters, playing with Aoi Shingo in Italy or controlling the mythic Ozora Tsubasa in his match against the brazillian prodigy, Carlos Santana (nope, he isn't the singer). You'll also play with Japan national team against the same opponents as they did in the anime version..</desc>

The game would then be available for sale shortly before or after the competition, which helped raise its profile.</desc>

	<desc>CB Chara Wars, sometimes written with the subtitle Ushinawareta Gag, is an RPG that features a crossover of sorts of Go Nagai's various manga franchises. These include Devilman and Mazinger Z, among others. The "CB" in the title refers to the term "chibi", which depicts characters as smaller and cuter than usual. In that sense, it is similar to the term SD (super deformation) found in several Super Famicokm Gundam game titles.CB Chara Wars began as an original video animation which first aired in 1991. A manga adaptation followed the following year, as did this game. Banpresto published the game in Japan, a company known for creating games with anime crossovers such as the Super Robot Taisen/Wars series.</desc>

	<name>Chinhai</name>
	<desc>Chinhai is a puzzle game for the Super Famicom and a variant on Mahjong Solitaire, or Shanghai. Instead of pairing and removing any two tiles that match as long as one of their sides is clear, as is the case in Shanghai, the rules of Chinhai require that the two tiles can only be removed if it's possible to draw a line between the two that doesn't make a 90 degree turn more than twice. Two tiles on opposite sides of the board, for instance, can't be paired because it would take three 90 degree turns to draw a line between them. To account for this added difficulty, the game lacks the "stacks" of tiles that frequently appear in Shanghai, instead presenting a flat board of tiles.Chinhai is named for the municipality of Chinhai in China, maintaining the theme of naming mahjong solitaire variants after territories in China. Chinhai has long since been renamed Zhenhai, which is situated in the Ningpo Prefecture and now part of a much larger city. This mahjong solitaire variant is perhaps best known as Sichuan or Shisenshou, also named for a province in China.</desc>

Instead of being another side-scrolling shooter, Bakuretsu Rantouden is actually a one-on-one 2D fighter a la Street Fighter in which the most recognizable characters from the Cho Aniki series (yes the speedo wearing bodybuilders included) fight each other for ultimate supremacy using special attacks and moves.

An interesting feature is that the game honors it's shooter roots, therefore instead of being restricted to walking backwards and forwards in the 2D plane and jumping around as in other fighting games, in this game all the characters can fly meaning the fights actually occur in mid-air allowing the players to dash all over the screen. Includes single player and 2-player vs modes.

	<desc>?In this sidescrolling action-platformer, Bonk is once again trying to save his world from the evil clutches of the reptilian king, who once more is threatening the prehistoric era.  Boy, you'd think that after being defeated four times prior that he would take a hint.  This time, you also get to face his five best soldiers, who will try to stop you in your tracks.  Bonk controls rather smoothly, and he is really fun to control.  To those of you that are not familiar with the series, Bonk is a caveman who attacks his enemies with his noggin; after jumping down, from below, while swimming, and while in the air.  He can even bounce off walls with his head, skip on the water like a stone if his head is facing down, climb certain walls with his teeth, scale up waterfalls, flip in the air (so long as the attack button is repeatedly being tapped), and so forth.  As is the case with the series, you start with a regular amount of health, but if you find a translucent heart icon, you'll increase your capacity.  What's neat is how collecting the food not only scores you some points but how it also replenishes a little bit of your health, too.  This time Bonk can also run if you hold down the A button, and the X button is used if you have a special ability on you.  If you find a power-up, whether it be piece of meat, or a different icon, then you will be given a power-up ability that will be taken out the moment you're hit once (damn).  Among the power-ups are the one where the fire will be spreading if Bonk hits his head on the ground (you know, the one where he looks freaky), one where Bonk turns into a bird and gains the ability to fly, one where Bonk becomes tiny and can make platforms made out of Japanese characters, and there is one where Bonk has the ability to double-jump as a girl.  Yes, Bonk becomes a girl if he eats the pink-colored meat.  I'm dead serious.</desc>

	<name>Choujikuu Yousai Macross : Scrambled Valkyrie</name>
	<desc>The legend of the Valkyrie pilots is not yet over. Hikaru, Max, and Millia take flight to defend the earth from Zentraedi, robots, more robots, and giant space crab-bees. Now is the time to scramble Valkyrie again. 

When starting a game or continuing the player picks from either Hikaru, Max, or Millia. Each flies a custom Valkyrie with its own set weapon load-out. A Valkyrie changes its weapon and movement speed by switching between its three forms: Fighter, Gerwalk, and Battroid. Typically the Valkyrie weapon shoots straight and quickly, the Gerwalk weapon shoots around or through obstacles, and the Battroid weapon does higher damage in exchange for reduced firing rate. Each weapon can be upgraded up to twice by picking up power up items dropped by special enemy ships, but one level of power up will be lost any time the Valkyrie is shot. If a Valkyrie's entire life bar is depleted then the full stage must be repeated, provided the player still has enough continues.

In a nod to Galaga the player is able to capture some enemy craft to increase their firepower. If the player does not shoot any weapons for a few seconds a field of electricity will cover the Valkyrie. Touching some enemy ships will then cause their targeting to be shorted out and make them friendly to the player, following along and shooting or ramming onscreen enemies.

	<name>Chou Mahou Tairiku Wozz </name>
	<desc>The magic world of Wozz, populated by magicians, alchemists, and other kinds of people - including simple town and village inhabitants - was a seemingly peaceful place, until one day, a poisonous rain started turning its inhabitants into monsters. The chief wizard realizes that the demon Balaam is trying to link the world of Wozz with the world of humans. Only a human hero can stop Balaam, and the wizard's teleporting magic brings... three young humans: the Japanese girl Reona Kitazato, and two boys: the American Shot Phoenix and the Chinese Chun Chingtao. Will those youngsters be able to stop Balaam?

The game is a traditional console-style RPG similar to Breath of Fire: turn-based battles are viewed from an isometric perspective. You control all three characters as a party, but in the beginning of the game you choose one of them as the main character, and therefore will see the game from his/her perspective. In case the characters split up, you'll be able to control only the one you chose.

	<desc>Cosmo Gang: The Puzzle is a puzzle game from Namco and the second game to feature their Cosmo Gang characters. The Cosmo Gang were originally attached to a group of redemption games (like pachinko or claw machines) from Namco, but would eventually star in two Arcade games: Cosmo Gang: The Video, a Galaga clone, and Cosmo Gang: The Puzzle.

This game would become the basis of Namco's more well-known puzzle game Pac-Attack, featuring Pac-Man. As with Pac-Attack, the idea is to stack up a lot of the animated face icons (members of the Cosmo Gang) in an unbroken chain and then drop a bomb (shaped like an arrow) that goes down the chain and eliminates them all at once.</desc>

The Cosmo Gang are based on a series of characters that had previously been used by Namco for a redemption game (a type of Arcade machine that dispenses award tokens for winning a rudimentary game, of which pachinko is the most popular variant) the previous year.

Galivan and company don't have time to find items or level up weapons as in Galivan's previous outing; this is a no holds barred slugfest. Three characters are playable, each with varying stats but basically the same moveset. Each character has a standard straight ahead punch or kick, a sweeping kick, an uppercut, and a ranged attack that must be charged up. At the start of the game and the end of every level the player can add stat points to their character to increase their HP, defense, jump height, and strength of normal and special attacks.

A 2 player versus mode is included as well. Both players can choose from the three main characters, and the second player can additionally choose from one of the four normal enemy types.</desc>

	<name>Crayon Shin Chan</name>
	<desc>Five-year-old Shinnosuke Nohara is the epitome of noisy children: loud and inappropriate, infuriating to his parents, and hilarious to onlookers. Shin-chan is always getting in trouble with his parents and saying bizarre or offensive things to everyone he meets. Every so often, though, he'll try to do what his mom wants him to, but more often than not, he'll misunderstand and simply confound his parents further.

Arashi o Yobu Enji ("A Kindergartner Called Tempest") is one of many games based on the manga and anime created by Yoshito Usui. In four stages, each made up of five areas, Shin-chan must explore his neighborhood looking for a specific object. He can enter houses to ask people for information, but will often end up simply insulting them. He must also avoid or knock over the other children in the neighborhood, and has various ability cards that he can use to assist him, which might give him a water pistol or refill his health. After finding what he's looking for, Shin-chan will move on to the next area.

Also included is a minigame mode with eight different minigames, such as a bubble-blowing contest, a three-legged race, and a desperate search for clothing before school. The entire game, including the minigames, is filled with dialogue containing the same humor as the source material.

The player, as the mischievous kindergartner Shin-chan, must rescue his favorite super hero Action Kamen ("Action Mask") from his prison before Action Kamen's supervillain nemesis Haiguremaou can take over both Action Kamen's and Shin-chan's worlds. Many of the bosses are transformed versions of Shin-chan's friends and family.

The game is a standard side-scrolling 2D platformer - common with licensed games - though it is notable for letting players decide which order they want to tackle stages, not to mention the franchise's penchant for weird/gross-out humor.</desc>

	<desc>There was once a prosperous kingdom, a peaceful kingdom, ruled by a wise old king, where all peopled lived happily together, protected by the power of a magical crystal. But one day, several dark clouds appeared over the kingdom and poured down a devastating rain. And then one of the clouds turned into a demon, and, reaching its hands to the treasure room in the palace, took the crystal away. The demon lord, still in a form of a menacing dark cloud, started spawning monsters and sending them to attack the now helpless kingdom. The king called to the heavens for help. Eight magical weapons fell on the ground, and eight warriors rose to protect their country. Your task now is to cleanse the land of the monsters and to defeat the evil demon lord.

"Crystal Beans" is an action RPG based on fighting and dungeon crawling. You can play as either of the eight initial character classes: Fighter, Warrior, Bow-man, Wizard, Priest, Kage (a kind of a ninja), Monk, or Witch. In addition, there are four secret classes you discover during your journey. Each class has its own strength and weaknesses, and two unique attack types.</desc>

	<name>Cu-On-Pa SFC</name>
	<desc>Cu-On-Pa SFC is the Super Famicom version of Cu-On-Pa.Cu-On-Pa is an original puzzle game that was developed by a little-known group called Onesong Partners. This group originally released an obscure game similar to this but with a wider audience in mind, various enhancements and alternate modes for PCs called "Endorfun" in 1995 in the U.S and Europe.Japanese developers seemed to like the concept and got permission to make something like it based on the original principals of Endorfun for the obscure Satellaview (or BS-X) and then later as a standalone release for the Super Famicom, where the game was called BS Cu-On-Pa and Cu-On-Pa, respectively. It would also get released later for Playstation.Published by T&amp;E Soft for the SFC late in 1996, Cu-On-Pa was also fan-translated sometime later for the emulation community, though the game comes with a rather straightforward tutorial and the game is very easy to understand, but difficult to master. This game is difficult to describe and in a league of its own.You play as a three-dimensional cube that must destroy all the "Life Panels" on a level. To do so, you have to rotate your cube and roll over the colored squares on the transparent field. Panels come in a variety of colors and the main way to elimate them is by having the color on the top of the cube match the color of the tile beneath you.The other way is for more skilled players and comes in the form of "Lightning Panels", which are generated when you destroy panels other than Life Panels. Destroy enough of them and you'll have lots of them. Then go and destroy a life panel! What will happen is, all lightning panels will explode that match the color of the life panel you rolled over. Moreover, the explosion spreads and detonates other tiles in the vicinity, which can spread and create a chain reaction. It's up to you how you wish to rack up points, either by time, chains, or both.Ken Kojima was the music composer.</desc>

	<name>Cyber Knight</name>
	<desc>In the 24th century, mankind has gone into space. The crew of the starship Swordfish are in an engagement with space pirates when the battle takes a turn for the worse. In desperation, the crew activate their jump drive without a destination... and end up flung across the galaxy to the galactic core. The Swordfish however is badly damaged with many casualties including the captain. Only 26 of the crew survive, and of them only 6 are qualified for combat: The commander, two soldiers, a mechanic and a doctor and six giant "Module" mechanized suits available for them. These survivors locate planet Farworld, apparently colonized by humans. There they discover the colony is under attack by a relentless mechanical aliens dubbed "Berserkers". The crew of the swordfish must fight back against the Berserkers and explore the galaxy for some means to return home.

Cyber Knight is an RPG with a science-fiction theme of being lost in an alien galaxy. The game takes place in a top-down view for movement on planets and areas, a side-view for combat sequences and a first person menu system when aboard the Swordfish starship. The Swordfish can travel between stars, scanning worlds for information. If the ship is able to land on a planet, three crew members piloting three Modules (giant robots) can be selected to debark and explore the planet. Many planets will have towns or people living on them which can be talked to in order to uncover information. Different quests are assigned in order to find the items necessary to progress. There is no system of currency or buying items. Instead, many defeated Berserkers leave behind "NeoParts", which can be brought back to the Swordfish's lab. Analysis of these Neo parts unlocks enhances statistics (endurance, agility, accuracy, etc) for the Modules and new weapons for them to carry. The six modules are unique in statistics, and also the six pilots each carry different skills.

Combat takes place in turn-based combat on a 6x6 squares field. Seen from the side view, the three modules can be positioned in relation to enemies in order to attack, using a variety of melee and long-ranged weaponry. Ammunition is unlimited, but each module also carries a number of "options" that are consumable attacks. Each Module has two sets of hitpoints: one for the pilot and one for the module itself. If either one of these reaches zero, the module is destroyed. In order to heal, the party carries 10 each of repair kits and first aid kits, which must when not in combat. These kits, as well as options and defeated pilots or modules can be restored by returning to the Swordfish.</desc>

	<desc>Following the events of the first Cyber Knight in the 24th century, the crew of the Swordfish have returned to Earth after defeating the mechanical "Berzerkers" far across space. However during their time away, the Earth Federation has been taken over by the ambitious General Forrest, who seeks to wage war on the independent systems and conquer them. Recognizing the potential weapons that could be made from the Berzerker science data, Forrest impounds the Swordfish and jails it's crew. The Berzerker data is used to create "Overtech" and bring to life "Metalliforms", self-replicating war machines. The Swordfish crew manages to escape, thanks to a mysterious agent "CJ", and are recruited into the resistance against the Earth Federation. Given a new spaceship, the Galvodirge, they must travel the galaxy to different human civilizations and devise a plan to stop Earth's attack.

Cyber Knight II is an RPG with science-fiction themes. As in the first game, much of the game takes place in a top-down view for movement on planets and areas, a side-view for combat sequences and a first person menu system when aboard the Galvodirge starship. The Galvodirge can travel between stars, scanning worlds for information. If the ship is able to land on a planet, the crew can debark either on foot or using combat modules (mechs). Some areas are only accessible using modules and others (such as towns) do not allow the use of these war machines. Many planets will have towns or people living on them which can be talked to in order to uncover information. Different quests are assigned in order to find the items necessary to progress. There is no system of currency or buying items. Instead, many defeated enemies leave behind "NeoParts", which can be brought back to the Swordfish's lab. Analysis of these Neo parts unlocks enhances statistics (endurance, agility, accuracy, etc) for the Modules and new weapons for them to carry. 

The crew are divided into a three person "combat team" and a three person "support team". If modules are used, they can be assigned from the ship's hanger. Unlike the first game, modules only perform a combat or a support role, and each is unique in statistics and the type of weaponry it can carry. When combat occurs on the main map, the support team will often deliver the first strike by firing missiles into the enemies. When searching facilities, caves or other locations, the support team is not available. Following either case, the combat team engages the enemy in turn-based combat on a 6x6 squares field. Seen from the side view, the three modules can be positioned in relation to enemies in order to attack, using a variety of melee and long-ranged weaponry. Ammunition is unlimited, but each module also carries a number of "options" that are consumable attacks. Each Module has two sets of hitpoints: one for the pilot and one for the module itself. If either one of these reaches zero, the module is destroyed. In order to heal, the party carries 10 each of repair kits and first aid kits, which must when not in combat. These kits, as well as options and defeated pilots or modules can be restored by returning to the Galvodirge.</desc>

	<desc>Nine young people were turned into cyborgs by a company trying to take over the world. They have defeated this company and are now using their super powers to protect the world.

Based on the manga/anime by the same name, Cyborg 009 is a side-scrolling platformer in which the player takes control of 8 different cyborgs, using their special abilities to complete several missions. 

Their special abilities are as follows:
002 can fly and hover in the air; 003 can see in the dark; 004 can fire bullets from his fingers and rockets from his knees; 005 can break rocks with his fists; 006 can blow fire that also melts rocks; 007 can take on different shapes including those of enemies; 008 can swim underwater for extended periods of time; 009 can move at very high speeds. (001 is a baby and can't be taken on missions). Using these special abilities consumes SP that slowly regenerate. 

In addition to their special abilities, the cyborgs also have four attributes that govern their attack and defensive powers, their amount of SP and SP regeneration speed. 

Before every mission, one cyborg is assigned leader and two more can be selected by the player. Only one cyborg can be controlled at a time, but it is possible to switch between cyborgs at any time. All cyborgs share the same HP and SP-bar. Throughout the levels, experience points can be collected and used to increase a cyborg's attributes after a completed mission.</desc>

	<desc>Six months after the DC War (as chronicled in Super Robot Wars 2), the DC seems to be regaining their former combat strength thanks to the Zabi family. In response, the United Nations has decided to reorganize itself into the Earth Federation.

The heroes of the last war are formed into a unit known as Londo Bell; however, the Earth Federation distrusts them due to their immense power, and provides them with as few resources as they can...</desc>

	<name>Dark Half</name>
	<desc>Through the Light came the Darkness, and through the Darkness came the Light. They were inseparable in the beginning, and gave birth to each other. Rukyu appeared before all the other creatures, the great demon of darkness, later to be known as the Satan. The divine hero-god Roda went up to his dark realm to defeat him, but was struck down, and presumed dead. But the hero couldn't die so easily: he swore to defeat Rukyu once and for all. Meanwhile, Rukyu doesn't just stay in his realm, waiting for Roda: he goes out to the world as a death-bringing sorcerer, and he is out for Roda...

The game is quite different from most other RPGs, because it lets you play as both the "good" hero and the villain. The game is divided into chapters, and each chapter is played by either Roda or Rukyu. You switch the two heroes chapter-after-chapter, and lead them to their ultimate battle from two opposite sides. The entire game, including the battles, is viewed from an isometric perspective. The battles are random and turn-based, and the battle field is divided into squares you can position and move your characters on. Both Roda and Rukyu can have party members join them, and both attack mostly with magic. Rukyu uses a special energy called "Soul Power", while Roda cast one-time spells from scrolls he receives after battles.</desc>

	<name>Dark Law: The Meaning of Death</name>
	<desc>Three-hundred years ago, there were two kingdoms on the earth -Reyfore, ruled by the benevolent and mighty king Reynard, and Amugnon, ruled by king Daruk. The two kingdoms could have lived in peace, but pride took over king Daruk, he didn't respect the Goddess any more, and as a result his mind became obsessed by the idea of destruction. Daruk attacked Reyfore, and for decades war was embracing the two kingdoms, setting the Earth in flames. After a prolonged battle, king Reynard defeated king Daruk, and a reign of prosperity began once again.

But can evil be truly defeated? The hero of the game, a young adventurer, falls down from a cliff while taking a stroll near the ancient Sophia Temple. He is saved by an old man who lives with his daughter Refia in a small country house. But one day, a demonic-looking knight appears, accompanied by monsters, kills the old man, and kidnaps Refia. The old man recognized the knight - it was king Daruk! Now the hero must bring Refia back and defeat Daruk once and for all.

The game has a less linear structure than a standard console-style RPG: together with the main story there are many missions, or "scenarios", which are not obligatory to complete, but which occupy a large portion of the game. In the beginning of the game you create a party of four characters, the hero and his three companions. The battles are pre-determined and take place on the same screen as the gameworld itself. Your party and the enemies can move freely around the screen and attack with melee and ranged weapons, and their actions depend on the amount of action points they have. Navigation in town is menu-based.</desc>

	<desc>Dear Boys is a 1994 Super Famicom basketball game based on the manga of the same name. The game features both a story mode, which follows the plot of the manga, and an exhibition mode that allows the player to go straight into a match.

The game features a "dramatic" perspective that is also slightly turn-based, similar to the Captain Tsubasa games. A window demonstrates what is happening - a ball is passed, a shot is thrown, the tip-off - in dramatic comic book style that is reminiscent of the manga. While a player's athlete has the ball, the player can pull up a menu that allows them to choose to pass, shoot or look at the present characters stats - each character has their own strengths and weaknesses that the player should keep in mind.</desc>

	<name>Dharma Doujou</name>
	<desc>Dharma Doujou was originally released in the arcades by Metro3D in 1994 (picture on the left). While the original version provides the same gameplay as the Super Famicom version tested here, the game does have some noticeable differences. First of all, it has more enemies and features colorful backgrounds borrowed from traditional Japanese themes and myths (well, in the Korean version of the game, Metro3D apparently threw in a couple of bikini girls for good measure). Additionally, the arcade game only contains a story mode and there is no progress map or alternate game modes like in the Super Famicom port. But, most importantly, the gameplay is slightly different - the player has to move the character around the screen in order to hit a block with the mallet. The Super Famicon version, on the contrary, automatically aligns the player with the furthest most block, and this apparently minor difference makes the gameplay of the home conversion more fast-paced and enjoyable than the original.</desc>

	<name>Doraemon</name>
	<desc>The game is based on the animé series "Doraemon". Doraemon is a blue robotic cat who has the ability to enter dream world and to help the people who live there. In this game, Nobita, a bespectacled friend of Doraemon's, suddenly meets a little fairy. Long ago, humans and fairies lived together in peace, but since the humans started developing their technology, the fairies have no place any more. Nobita and Doraemon travel to the dream world to find out how can they help.

The game is divided into adventure and platform action modes. In adventure mode, you navigate Doraemon from a top-down view, talking to people and entering houses. When you have gathered enough information, a place on the map will be highlighted. If Doraemon (or other characters, later in the game) enters this place, a platform action section begins. In platform mode, Doraemon must overcome the obstacles and defeat enemies by jumping on them or by throwing magic dusk at them, in order to retrieve important items.

	<desc>The game is closely related to Doraemon: Nobita to Yosei no Kuni. It is based on the manga "Doraemon", that tells the story of a Japanese boy named Nobita, who always gets bullied by stronger kids in the school. In the future, his grandson uses a time machine and send the cat-like robot Doraemon to protect Nobita. In this adventure, Nobita, Doraemon, and their friends travel to the Toys Land. Some evil toys are threatening this country, and it's up to our heroes to help its inhabitants.

The game is divided into adventure and platform action modes. In adventure mode, Doraemon walks around towns, talking to people and entering houses. Key locations lead to platform levels, which must be completed to advance the story. Platform levels include plenty of obstacles (pits, spikes, self-destructing platforms etc.), as well as various enemies who try to stop the heroes. You can choose one of the six available characters to play through the platform level. They all can jump and defeat enemies either by jumping on their heads or by using long-ranged weapons.

This is an action platform game with adventure elements. You can control Doraemon, Nobita, and other characters, traveling through platform levels, defeating or avoiding enemies. Each character has his own weapon and possesses a special ability (for example, Suneo can crawl through narrow spaces, etc.) which is often required to complete a stage. In present time, you travel through Nobita's town in top down view, talking to characters and entering houses. There is also a slight RPG element in the game, as you can buy items and upgrade your weapons.

	<desc>A young boy named Milon sets off to save Alis, his fairy friend, after she was captured by the evil sorcerer Amon. He later learns that the only way to defeat Amon is by collecting five legendary instruments which Amon has stolen.  The sorcerer placed a curse on these instruments so that their true powers cannot be used and then left them in the hands of his minions.  The only way to lift the curse is by collecting five stars.

Armed with only his bubble shooter, Milon must retrieve the legendary instruments, lift their curses and use their powers to defeat Amon and rescue Alis.

Traveling through many different worlds starting with the forest, Milon will be confronted by many enemies. Milon can either shoot bubbles to trap and send his enemies away, or he can jump and flatten his enemies temporarily turning them into a platform for him to walk across. 

Milon has three different "outfits": red, blue, and green. With the green outfit, Milon can withstand three hits. Each time he gets hit, he will be downgraded a color - green to blue, blue to red. If he gets hit with the red outfit, he will die and have to start the level over.

By collecting 100 music notes, Milon will get an extra life. There are also other useful items to get like bubble gum that will save Milon once if he were to fall, a special bubble shooter that let's him shoot multiple bubbles at once and a star that makes Milon temporarily invincible so that he can defeat enemies simply by running at them.</desc>

	<name>Dossun ! Ganseki Battle</name>
	<desc>A falling block puzzle game  in a pseudo-medieval fantasy setting that pits two characters against each other in an abstract form of combat that is quite similar to games like Columns. Combining at least three matching symbols in a vertical, horizontal or diagonal line does not only clear them off the screen, but also deals damage to an opponent. This means that players do not only have to keep their game area clear, but also pay attention to their characters health bar. Once a block touches the top of the screen or the health bar is diminished the game ends.

There are four different icons that have different effects when combined:
Books, swords and rocks deal damage to an opponent by attacking with fireballs, dragons or swords.
Bottles heal a certain amount of health.
Purple blocks have no effect, but clog up the screen nonetheless.

Chain reactions result in particularly powerful attacks or place one or more grey blocks inside the opponents area. They can be destroyed just like ordinary blocks, but they always stay in the same spot and do not fall down.

More complex chain reactions give access to special attacks, up to three of which can be held and activated with the shoulder buttons. Special attacks have different effects that include clearing all purple blocks, using all potions and clearing the bottom three lines.

As expected of a Nekketsu game you can play it rough by sneaking punches and kicks to "bend" the rules a bit, you can also use the "ki" or willpower of your players to trigger special moves and strategic management is limited to specifying different base strategies and behaviors for each player.</desc>

	<name>Dragon Ball Z Super Gokuden : Kakusei Hen</name>
	<desc>This is a direct sequel to the  first "interactive fighter" for SNES, based on the popular manga/animé series Dragon Ball. The game picks up the story where it ended in the previous game, and continues through Piccolo, Saiyajin, and Freezer sagas of the manga. After the battle with the Demon King (Daimaou) Piccolo, the twenty-third World Martial Arts Tournament is about to begin. But to the amazement of the hero Son Goku and his friends, their archrival Piccolo appears during the tournament, so that it quickly turns into a genuine battle.

You control Son Goku and his son Son Gohan, switching between them as the game progresses. The game is basically an interactive comic book in which you can influence the story by choosing to press a button when the game prompts you to make a choice. You'll also participate in battles. The battle system is similar to rock-paper-scissors game, where one kind of move always beats or always loses to another. You can dash into your enemies, attack physically, and perform special moves, pressing the buttons in real time (although the battles are divided into turns).

	<path>./Dragon Ball Z - Super Saiya Densetsu (Japan) (Translated En).sfc</path>
	<name>Dragon Ball Z : Legend of the Super Saiyan</name>
	<desc>Cho Saiya Densetsu is based on the popular manga/animé series Dragon Ball. It follows the events described in the beginning of Dragon Ball Z, the second story block, which tells about the connection of the hero Son Goku with a powerful alien race, and new mighty foes from far away planets. The game starts just where the tale of Dragon Ball begins. Son Goku goes to meet his friends, but is stopped by a mysterious stranger named Raditz who tells Son Goku they are relatives. Raditz demands from him to destroy humanity, and as Son Goku refuses, takes his son Son Gohan hostage. To rescue his son, Son Goku joins forces with his arch-rival, the Demon King Piccolo, who obviously has his own plans concerning Raditz. And thus begins the story during which Son Goku will learn of his true origin...

The game is a RPG similar to the card-based Dragon Ball Z RPGs for NES. During battles, you choose cards from your card inventory, which determine the nature and the strength of your characters' attacks. You can also train your characters in training houses and upgrade their special Ki power. Unlike early DBZ RPGs, you can move around freely in Cho Saiya Densetsu, and your movements are not determined by cards. You can also fly around the world and use your special Dragon Radar to discover location of magical Dragon Balls.

	<name>Dragon Quest I.II</name>
	<desc>This is a remake of two classic NES RPGs - an exclusively Japanese release of the two first Dragon Quest titles on one cartridge.

In Dragon Quest (known as Dragon Warrior in the US), you play as the descendant of the legendary warrior Erdrick, and your goal is to recover the magical Ball of Light from Erdrick's and the humanity's arch-enemy, the Dragon Lord. In Dragon Quest II, you assume the role of the descendant of the hero of the first game, and must join forces with two other characters in order to defeat a demon lord who destroyed a nearby city and killed its inhabitants. 

Both RPGs feature random battles and turn-based combat viewed from first-person perspective. In Dragon Quest you fight alone, while in the sequel two other characters can join your party, and you also fight against multiple enemies at once.

The remake includes updated graphics (although they still retain the original NES look), sound of SNES quality, and some changes in the gameplay and in the game world. Certain locations are larger, some menu commands (such as "Stairs") are omitted, and there is a larger variety of items.

	<name>Dragon Quest III</name>
	<desc>Dragon Warrior III is the concluding game of the first Dragon Quest/Dragon Warrior trilogy, and its story takes us back to the time period of the legendary Erdrick (also known as Loto), the ancestor of the first game's hero. You are the son of a powerful warrior Ortega, skillful in physical combat and spellcasting. Your father went out to fight the evil Baramos, who is responsible for the appearance of monsters in your region, and never returned. You are sent by the king on a quest to continue your father's brave deeds and to defeat Baramos.

Dragon Warrior III is a top-down role-playing game where you travel around the overworld, caves, castles, cities and other locations while battling random encounters, buying equipment, and talking to people. You and your party members receive experience when they beat up monsters and level up with enough experience, increasing their stats. The game features a day/night cycle - as you travel, day slowly changes to night and vice versa; shops are typically closed at night. 

You begin with control of just the main character but can quickly recruit three more members to your party. During the game you can choose to drop your current characters and recruit others at any time. The recruitable characters are divided into six classes: soldier, fighter, merchant, goof-off, pilgrim and wizard.

The game has a unique job system, giving you the ability to switch your hired characters' classes after they have achieved at least level 20 in their base class. Characters can switch to the other beginning classes, as well as the sage class, which is not available at the beginning. When a character switches classes, they lose all earned experience points, and half of their stats, but retain all of the abilities of the previous class. In this way, you can create powerful combination characters that are able to cast spells and fight effectively.

	<name>Dragon Quest V</name>
	<desc>You are the son of the brave warrior, Lord Papas. It appears that your mother died just after giving birth to you, and your father took you on a long journey when you were a little baby, and all you know is that he was searching for something. Now you are six years old, and Lord Papas brings you to your home village. After some time, you learn that His Highness Prince Henry was kidnapped by bandits. Your father attempts to rescue him, and during this action you discover that perhaps your mother is still alive... The game follows the story of Papas' son, and this story is stretched over years, as the hero grows and becomes a man of courage and virtue. During the game, the hero will discover the truth about his mother, and will have to make some crucial decisions, such as which girl to marry (the decisions affect the course of the game and its ending).

"Dragon Quest V" is a party RPG with turn-based combat, and battles viewed from 1st person perspective, just like all its predecessors. Your party roams about the world, fighting random enemies, performing quests, and defeating bosses. The novelty is in the game's unusual story, which spans almost a lifetime of the hero. 

"Dragon Quest V" was not available outside of Japan until 2009, when the DS version was released in the United States.

Was this just a dream? You have just fallen out of your bed dreaming! It's time to go to the village elder, to get a seemingly simple assignment - to sell some goods at a bazaar in the nearest town. But soon the hero will discover his dream was not so far away from reality...

"Dragon Quest VI" is the last SNES game of the Dragon Quest series (called "Dragon Warrior" in US). It is a party RPG with turn-based combat and battles viewed from 1st person perspective. Not much has changed since the NES days of Dragon Quest - gameplay style, setting, and even menu layout seem almost identical to those of the early classics. Like its immediate predecessor Dragon Quest V, this game was never released outside Japan.

	<desc>Long time ago, a flourishing civilization was destroyed by the rage of a mighty dragon. The Earth was set in flames, and no one escaped the destruction - no one except one man, who managed to launch himself forward, thousand years into the future. There, he was found by people of Kardosa Empire, who soon understood they have in their hands a human who possesses the secret of a superior ancient technology, that was unknown to the primitive civilization of the present...

You play the role of Aleth, the son of the High Priest in the small kingdom of Garade, whom leads a peaceful life with his friend Lagnus, Prince of Garade. One day Aleth accidentally gains possession of a precious artifact which is sought after by the Kardosa Empire. Aleth and Lagnus get involve in a conflict which will soon lead them to great discoveries of the secrets of the ancient civilization, of the great destruction that occurred thousand years ago, and of their own true identities...

The game is a console-style RPG: your party meets randomly encountered enemies and bosses, and fights them in turn-based combat viewed from isometric perspective. You upgrade armor by buying it, and also can buy weapons, but weapons can also be upgraded for money to different levels, to create powerful attacks called "techs".</desc>

	<desc>Dynamic Stadium is a baseball game from Eleca/Electronics Application released exclusively for the Super Famicom. While adopting the same behind-the-batter perspective as Namco's Famista series, Dynamic Stadium presents its athletes as comic book heroes rather than chibi figures, making them absurdly buff and frequently featuring action shots of them catching fly-balls and narrowly making it to base before being caught out. "Safe!" and "Out!" calls are presented as spiky word balloons.

Dynamic Stadium does not feature an official NPB license, so all the team names are fictitious. The game was published in Japan by Sammy Corporation and was never localized for overseas territories.</desc>

In Edo no Kiba you are always moving forward, either running or walking (or, in some levels, flying), although you can still move around the screen as in most belt-scrolling games. Your avatar attacks by slashing to the right with his energy sword, and he can also hold his sword defensively to deflect some bullets. By then holding forward and releasing attack he can throw the sword like a boomerang. He can also jump. A bomb follows the avatar around on any on-foot level that can be used to destroy all enemies onscreen at any time, and it will be replaced whenever a life is lost. Environments range from city streets to sewers and a flying battleship. Each level ends with a boss fight against an enemy that can withstand many attacks.</desc>

	<name>Emerald Dragon</name>
	<desc>In "Emerald Dragon", you play as Atrushan, a blue dragon who lives in the Dragon World. One day, he and his friends discover a ship wreck near a mountain. After examining the wreck, the dragons find a human child - a little girl. The wise White Dragon, the leader of the dragons, tells them that her name is Tamryn and that she will play an important role in their lives. The girl doesn't remember anything, and grows up together with the dragons. But when she turns fifteen, she decides to go back to her homeland - the Human World. Soon after Tamryn has left, Atrushan realizes he can't bear the separation, and asks the White Dragon to allow him to go and find Tamryn in the Human World. But a mysterious evil curse has been placed on the dragons - they can't appear among the humans in their true form. Atrushan agrees to become a human and goes to the Human World - to find Tamryn, and also a way to remove the curse...

The game features traditional Japanese-style RPG gameplay - Atrushan and his party travel over world map, visiting towns and descending into dungeons. The battle system is somewhat unusual - you can control only Atrushan, while other party members are controlled by the AI. You have a special bar for your actions in battle: once it is depleted, you can't perform any action and must wait for your next turn. You can move freely over the battle field, position yourself strategically near or far away from the enemy, attack from different sides, and assign general strategies to your non-controllable party members.</desc>

He is sent to jail to be executed, but manages to escape with the help of two former unit colleagues. The group flees through the country-side, while being pursued by imperial soldiers. On their way, they join forces with other rebels to fight against the enemy, while uncovering hidden secrets and evil plots by the Empire.

FEDA: Emblem of Justice is a strategy RPG similar to Shining Force and other titles with preset characters and linear gameplay. The player commands a party of varying size and characters with diverse skills.

In the main battle sections, the player and the CPU-controlled enemy take turns moving the troops and giving orders. A menu at the bottom of the screen shows all the possible actions, where soldiers can defend, move, attack, or use an inventory item on each turn. The range of their movements and weapons vary according to their nature. A crossbow character can shoot from the back, while most sword and knife users have to be adjacent to their targets. Magic offensive powers have different ranges as well, reaching enemies that are far away from the attacking character. Health points can be recovered by eating rations or by magic, where a healer can restore points to several characters at once.

Each party member has separate health and magic points, as well as other statistics like defense and attack power. They receive experience points after slaying an enemy or casting a spell, and extra points at the end of the battle. Their skills increase after surpassing 100 points.

The map screen shows the party and groups of enemies traveling through the landscape in turns. The menu has options for moving the group or camping. In the encampment, one of the characters around the fire pit saves the game, while another inside the tent provides system options to change the interface color, adjust sound volume and rename the party members.

In some locations like temples, villages and towns, the party has to explore the place and talk to the citizens to move on to the next section. In later battles, the player has to make a moral choice about attacking mutated humans. At the end of each battle, the party is assigned a dark or light emblem, and certain party members choose to leave or stay in the group based on its alignment.</desc>

	<name>Final Fantasy II</name>
	<desc>This is the fourth entry in the  Final Fantasy series. It was known as Final Fantasy II internationally, because the  second and third games were never released outside of Japan.

The military country of Baron is one of the strongest in the land, with a proud army and a majestic air force known as the Red Wings. But, while their armies are kind and loyal, the recent actions of the King are anything but. The young Captain of the Red Wings, Cecil, is ordered to steal a crystal from a village of innocent magicians, and when he questions the actions of his King, Cecil is immediately thrown out of the country and sent off to kill strange monsters. Little does he realize the price the King's actions will pay, and what the true secret of the crystals, and their powers, truly is...

This is the first Final Fantasy game that introduced the famous ATB (active-time battle) system: during the battles, you have a time indicator for each party member that tells you when this character is able to act. If it takes you too long to select a command for this character, the enemy will act without waiting for your turn. The game abandons the job system that was implemented in the first and the third game in favor of pre-set character classes (paladin, white mage, ninja, etc.) assigned to each party member.

The PlayStation version adds a new rendered intro and ending.</desc>

	<name>Final Fantasy V</name>
	<desc>The Elemental Crystals...the life source of the planet. With them, gentle winds blow, the seas are active, fire burns bright, and the earth is full of life. All seems well in the world, until the wind suddenly stops, the sea begin to grow stagnant, the heat of fire becomes scarce, and the earth begins to wither. King Tycoon, sensing a premonition of evil, hurries off to check on the Wind Crystal, only to witness it destroy itself.

Meanwhile, a young traveler named Butz is camping in a field when a giant meteor strikes the planet. When he heads out to examine the meteor, he is shocked to find a young girl named Lenna, who is the princess of Tycoon, and a old man named Galuf, who is on a critical mission. Later, joined by Faris, a pirate captain, the foursome must travel the land in search of the destructor of the Crystals, and save the planet at any cost!

Final Fantasy V featured many new gameplay options and tactics, including an improved Job/Ability system (like in Final Fantasy Tactics), the return of the ATB (Active Time Battle) turn system, and all of the classic FF gameplay you've come to know and love!

Final Fantasy V was released as a stand-alone game in Japan, and again in Final Fantasy Collection. Its U.S. debut was as part of Final Fantasy Anthology. It was also later ported to the Gameboy Advance, adding 4 new Jobs, a new 30-floor dungeon, a bestiary, a music player, the ability to quick save anywhere, a few extra pieces of equipment, and a newly update translation.</desc>

	<name>Final Fantasy III</name>
	<desc>This is the sixth entry in the  Final Fantasy series. It was called Final Fantasy III because three of the five previous installments of the series were never released outside of Japan.

1,000 years ago, the War of the Magi occurred. People remember it as one of the most horrible tragedies in history. Since the War of the Magi, magic has been all but forgotten, technology began to grow, and people returned to seemingly normal lives. The only true worry people had was the Empire, whose leaders were looking to revive the great force once known as "magic".

But then...something happened that would change the course of history forever...

The Empire had heard word of the remains of a mystical being, known as an "Esper", being found in the mining town of Narshe. Quickly, three soldiers were dispatched to find this Esper and bring it to the Emperor. One of the soldiers, a young girl, triggers a power in the Esper that will begin one of the most dangerous series of events ever. And the only ones who can help her are a rag-tag band of rebels and heroes, whose very hearts and souls are the only ones that can save the world from the mad plans of the Empire.

The game maintains the ATB (active time battle) system of the two previous Final Fantasy games, spicing classic turn-based combat engine with a real-time element. The customization system combines character-specific classes with free-flowing character development. By finding various Espers and equipping them on characters, you can improve their parameters in different ways and choose the magic spells you want to learn for each character.</desc>

Book 1 of the game is essentially a remake of the first NES game. Book 2 continues the story with the same characters.

This game expands the series, however it drops explorable towns and the navigation through a world map which was introduced in Fire Emblem: Gaiden. New features include the ability to dismount the horse and pegasus mounted units, to allow the riders to fight indoors if needed.

At its most simple the story is of Prince Leaf of Lenster's struggle to free his native land from two forces, the Grandbell Empire and the Loptus religion.

Features introduced into this part of the series include fog of war and night maps with limited vision, this requires characters to use torches and wands to light their way. Also the capture command which allowed enemies to be subdued and their weapons taken.

	<name>From TV animation - Slam Dunk SD Heat Up!!</name>
	<desc>Among the most famous Japanese comics of the 90s are definitely Slam Dunk. The manga tells of the running track that will make the young hoodlum Hanamichi Sakuragi who joined the basketball club in Shohoku high school just because initially interested in the sister of the captain Akagi but later this sport will conquer him so much that he becomes a real basketman.

The game is essentially an arcade sports title basketball basically. The main screen there will be little choice given the presence of only three modes: Story mode and classic friendly tournament. In the first we follow the events of the television series whose plot differs slightly from the original one: using Shohoku then we will qualify for the national championship. The second and third but I think there is a need for further explanation.

Executable field operations would also be different, you can also feint shots and blow up their opponents markers. Then successfully accumulating a sequence of 'affirmative action' row (steps succeeded, baskets made or avoided), will fill a horizontal bar at the top of the screen and, as he did a little 'in the playroom with the SNK Street Hoop, pressing simultaneously the three keys will not dorsal (except B), you can make a super nice shooting with supplemental animations depending on the player used.

	<path>./Front Mission (Japan) [T-En by FH v1.0b].sfc</path>
	<name>Front Mission</name>
	<desc>In the future, many military forces are dependent on huge mech robots, called Wanzers (Walking Panzers) for combat. At Huffman Island, located in the the pacific ocean, wanzers are deployed by both the USN (United States of the New Continent) and the OCU (Oceana Community Union), who dispute ownership over the island.  One night, the OCU forces stage a covert recon mission on a facility located in Larcus, a USN-held territory and weapons facility. Lead by a soldier named Roid, this mission was entirely unofficial and violated the peace treaty. During the mission, USN forces lead by Commander Driscoll appeared and ambushed the OCU soldiers. During the combat, Roid's fiance, Karen is killed and the USN facility is blown up; placing the blame on the OCU. This became known as the &amp;quot;Larcus Incident&amp;quot; and the OCU denied all knowledge of it's soldiers actions. Ultimately it would be a leading cause to the second Huffman War. 

One year later, the war is underway and Huffman island is under provisional control of the OCU, but with a weakened military unable to defend against USN attacks. The soldiers involved involved in the Larcus Incident have all been discharged and disgraced. Roid spends his time fighting as a gladiator in the Wanzer fighting arena before being approached by a mysterious man. Colonel Olson has found out about Roid's history and wants him to command a mercenary unit he is assembling on behalf of the OCU, dubbed &amp;quot;Carrion Crow&amp;quot;. Convincing Roid that Driscoll is still out there on the island, Roid agrees.

Front Mission is a turn-based strategy RPG played from an isometric perspective. Players progress in the story through large strategic battles involving multiple units and cutscenes between them. At certain places, usually towns, the player can visit multiple locations including bars and shops, and talk to people. Shops are also found to purchase new weaponry, parts and make repairs. In combat, each Wanzer robot is a seperate unit and, has a large variety of weapons and attack styles depending on what's equipped. Units get experience for defeating enemies and also for using various techniques. The more an attack is used, the more powerful it becomes.</desc>

	<path>./Front Mission Series - Gun Hazard (Japan) [T-En by Aeon Genesis v1.01].sfc</path>
	<name>Front Mission - Gun Hazard</name>
	<desc>The year is 2064, when the great solar power satellite, ATLAS is overshadowed by the invention of fusion power. The government alliance that had supported the building of ATLAS now find themselves facing economic crisis as the balance of power shifts. In this world of conflict and change, the Walking Panzer, or Wanzer, (a form of mecha) becomes the standard armored unit for wars and petty battles across the globe. For the small nation of Bergen, a coup d'etat is underway, staged by Colonel Ark. Seeking to establish complete control over the government and the NORAD units stationed there, Ark's first step involves the capture of President Orwen. Tipped off to the rebellion, Orwen seeks to flee from Bergen, looking for safe passage out of the seaport of Port Ertothal. A young Wanzer pilot, Albert Grabner, is assigned escort duty to the president by loyal elements of the army stationed there...

Gun Hazard is a side-scrolling version of the Front Mission series. Gameplay is more than a little similar to Cybernator or Metal Warriors. The player moves between different stages on an area map. Once inside a level, the player controls Albert and his wanzer as it moves left, right across the screen. The wanzer is able to jump, and attack with a primary and a special weapon. At any time during a level, Albert can eject from his heavily armed wanzer to explore. Although vulnerable when outside, Albert is able to reach areas the wanzer cannot, in addition to being a smaller target and being able to jetpack indefinitely.

Additionally, Albert can recruit other characters through the normal course of the story, some of whom can be designated to support roles. These support characters when set can provide a variety of different cover fire abilities for Albert during his missions. They too gain experience and levels. Different weapons and armor can be found or bought. Essential components include the Booster ability which allows the wanzer to hover and increase it's jumps, as well as the Dash ability which allows quick left-right movement by the wanzer. Money and experience are earned through the completion of level objectives as well as the kill count of enemy wanzers.</desc>

	<desc>The legend of the Golden Condor... from village to village and  from town to town, everybody speak of it - somewhere, beyond forests and mountains, there lies an idyllic Golden Land, the land of eternal happiness. Many adventurers have tried to find their way to the mysterious land of the Golden Condor, but how many of them have survived the impassable mountain paths, the dark forests and caves, and the vicious monsters? You are the wanderer Shiren, and the goal of your life is to find the Golden Land. Together with your best buddy Koppa, a talking weasel, you decide to venture deep into the dungeons that lead to the land, and to try your luck there.

Furai no Shiren (The Wanderer Shiren) is a roguelike, hack-and-slash game with randomly generated dungeon areas, items, and monsters. Despite being named Fushigi no Dungeon 2 it has no relation to the storyline or characters of the first game in the series, it does however share the same style of gameplay. The movement is turn-based. You visit towns and villages where you can buy and sell supplies. The dungeons are full of various traps and monsters, and sometimes non-playable characters you can talk to, some of which can join you on your quest.

	<path>./Galaxy Wars (Japan).sfc</path>
	<name>Galaxy Wars</name>
	<desc>Home version of the 1979 arcade game of the same name. The aim is to launch missiles from the bottom of the screen at enemy spacecraft located at the top. To get there, the missile must pass through a asteroid belt flying across the screen and avoid the shots being fired down from the spacecraft. It is the players job to control the missile. Once launched it can be moved left and right and can be sped up by using the boost to speed it's way out of trouble. Points scored depend on the location of the hit on the enemy spacecraft. The speed at which enemy spacecraft move increases as the number of them decreases. Once all spacecraft have been destroyed, another wave starts, the speed decreases again and the process repeats. A life is lost when a missile is hit by a shot or collides with an asteroid.

Three game modes are available, B&amp;W and Color recreate the graphics and behaviour of the original arcade game in black &amp; white and color respectively whilst Neo mode updates the game with improved graphics and slightly different behaviour. There's also a turn-based two player mode. Other options include changing the number of lives available at the start of a game and the number of points needed for an extra ship.</desc>

	<desc>As you may have guessed from the number 2 in the title, this is the second SNES game in the popular blend of the adventure and jump and run genres which is the Goemon series. Again, you (and your partner, in 2 player mode) control Goemon, his friend Ebisu-Maru and, new to the bunch, robot Sasuke, through loads of action stages and villages. Another new feature comes with 3D boss fights, featuring the giant mech type robot called "Goemon Impact".

	<path>./Ganbare Goemon 3 - Shishi Juurokubee no Karakuri Manjigatame (Japan).sfc</path>
	<name>Ganbare Goemon 3</name>
	<desc>Third title in the Ganbare Goemon series of platform/adventure games which cast you as the heroic Goemon as he attempts to save feudal Japan from all sorts of wacky evildoers. This time around, a time-travelling machine threatens all of Japan and thus Goemon and co. must jump into the future to stop the machine.

The game alternates between a top-down world map view in which your characters explore the gameworld and side-scrolling stages in which the main action lies. As in most games of the series there are also loads of mini-games and unique gameplay sequences such as maneuvering Goemon's giant mecha.

The game continues the tradition of bizarre humor unique to the series, you can play as either Goemon or any of his 3 companions, Ebisumaru, Sasuke or Yae with each sporting unique weapons and abilities and also with their own dialogue options and cutscenes, which feature sitcom-like pre-recorded laughs for added wackiness.

	<desc>Fourth title in the Ganbare Goemon series of platform/adventure games which cast you as the heroic Goemon and his gang of wacky adventurers as he fights evil all over Japan. This sequel however, takes the action to outer space as the gang attempts to rescue Goemon Impact (Goemon's giant mecha) from a strange planet.

The game is based around a stage-select hub from which you select which character you want to play as and then attempt to clear the game's many side scrolling stages in standard action platformer fashion, navigating the obstacles and defeating all enemies you run into with your weapons. Since each one of Goemon's allies got stranded on a different planet, you must take control of each one of them in order to clear the stages and recover the special ability unique to each character that must be later put to use to release Goemon Impact. As in other games of the series there are also loads of mini-games and unique gameplay sequences triggered in boss fights, bonus stages and special situations. These involve shooter sequences, racing &amp; sport games and other assorted diversions.</desc>

In Ganbare Daiku no Gensan, you must go through five stages (with two areas each), destroying workers that get in your way using your mallet. You can use it to perform two special attacks. One that sends fireballs going in all directions, and a more powerful one that sends shockwaves, destroying everything on screen.

	<path>./Ganpuru - Gunman's Proof (Japan) (Translated En).sfc</path>
	<name>Gunple: Gunman's Proof</name>
	<desc>The year is 1880. Two meteors fell on Earth on a small island near North American Pacific Coast. In the middle of the island there is a small town governed by a sheriff. At first, the town's inhabitants didn't pay attention to the meteors. But then, strange things started happening. Monsters attacked people, and left on the victims' bodies a mysterious crest with one word: demiseed. One day you, a young boy who lives in the town, are contacted by two aliens who came in a miniature space ship. One of the aliens introduces himself as Zero, the Space Sheriff, and explains that an intergalactic criminal named Demi has escaped from justice and is hiding somewhere on the island, being the cause of all the troubles lately. Zero then possesses your body, lends you his powers, and commands you on the quest to destroy Demi and to bring peace to your island and to the alien world alike!

The game is an action/adventure with slight RPG elements (buying and upgrading weapons, etc.) set in Wild West. While featuring traditional dungeon-crawling and many enemies to dispose of in real time combat, the game doesn't equip you with standard medieval swords, but with pistols, shotgun, machine gun, and even a flamethrower. Your weapons have infinite ammo. You can duck to avoid the alien monsters' fire, and perform special attacks with various types of weapons.</desc>

	<desc>One year ago they took from you your wife. Now it's time to pay them back, with interest.

Gekitotsu Dangan Jidousha Kessen: Battle Mobile plays similarly to Spyhunter in both perspective and objective, but your car in Battle Mobile isn't quite as high tech an instrument as that other game's vehicle. You can launch unlimited missiles, but they can only hit helicopters. For ground based targets you must dash into them to ram them off the road. Your car's health is constantly dwindling, even when you're not being attacked by enemies, so picking up the occasionally appearing energy refill items is essential. Shields can be picked up and stored that will make your car invulnerable to all damage for a short while.</desc>

	<name>Genocide 2</name>
	<desc>The world is still recovering from war. The mega-corporation CONEX has been spearheading the rebuilding process, but their true intentions are far from altruistic. By gobbling up their competition, and with the help of new weapons technology, CONEX is on the cusp of controlling the world. Only a hero from the last war can defy them and stop their plans of conquest.

Genocide 2 is a modified version of the PC release. The player takes control of a ten meter tall robotic ninja: the Tracer. Its only form of attack is a sword, but it can hold several extra weapons, and always has access to the Betty. The Betty can be fired in eight directions, returns to the Tracer after being fired, and can block enemy bullets. The objective of each stage is to reach the end, and some stages require you to destroy targets along the way. Any items picked up by the player, or damage done to the Tracer, carries over between stages, and each stage records your fastest time for beating them.

Aside from the visual downgrade, Genocide 2 also lost many minor enemy types and one mid-boss in the transition to the Super Famicom. The first stage was removed, and the first two levels of stage 2 were reversed. The Betty now can only be used for a limited time, and must recharge when its time has run out.</desc>

	<name>Ghost Chaser Densei</name>
	<desc>Ghost Chaser Densei doesn't take any dramatic departures from the standard scrolling-brawler plot-line. A city twenty minutes in the future must be saved from a terrorist organization, and between salvation and you is a long, straight line full of goons who must be punched. Aside from receiving orders from your boss before each level, and the quick conversation with a boss or rare NPC, the story won't attempt to get in the way of beat-downs.

There are three playable characters in Ghost Chaser Densei: the martial artist Makai, the mace wielding cat-girl Iyo, and the autonomous robot Belva. Each has unique moves as well as the basic abilities of attacking, jumping, blocking, throwing, and using a special if attack and jump are pressed together. Unlike most brawlers these special moves deplete a recharging special bar, not your health. Makai can throw fireballs and do a flying kick in midair, Iyo can triangle jump and preform a spinning piledriver, and Belva can double jump and preform a grapple special. Characters also have a team up special if playing in two player mode. Enemies range from armored soldiers to lizard men to robots, but most break down into the same hierarchy: weaker types will rush at you while stronger types will shoot projectiles then rush at you. Each level ends with a unique boss with multiple short and long range attacks.</desc>

	<desc>Ackman is not what one would call a good person. His job is to murder and steal souls for the Demon Lord. The angel Tenshi has taken it upon himself to put an end to Ackman's nefarious ways, and sends an army of angels and hired assassins to take out Ackman for good. It's just as well, because Ackman was getting bored without anyone to kill.

Go Go Ackman is a scrolling platformer starring the titular Ackman. Ackman can punch and charge up a ranged wave of energy, and he can also jump on some enemies to stun them before running into them and turning them into a sliding projectile. Ackman can hold up to three bombs that can clear the screen of enemies, and can also hold a weapon, either a sword, boomerang, or pistol, but it will be lost if Ackman is hit. Levels are linear, but do allow some exploration to find weapons and items hidden off the beaten road.</desc>

Ackman still murders at whim and has his companion Godon collect the souls of his slain, but this time Ackman can keep the weapons he finds, either sword, boomerang, or gun. Each weapon can be upgraded twice, but upgrades will be lost if Ackman is hit or finds a new weapon. Ackman can also now throw smaller enemies, although he can't move while holding them.

Who's really pulling the strings here? And, most importantly, does Ackman care about any of this at all?

The last of the Ackman games, Go Go Ackman 3 makes very few changes from Go Go Ackman 2, although Tenshi is now a playable character. Both Ackman and Tenshi can be switched between at special points in a level, but they share the same health meter and weapon. Unlike Ackman Tenshi can fly, but as he is an angel he can not collect the souls of enemies he kills. Souls have changed too, and are now used as currency in shops where Ackman can buy temporary powerups or healing. Finally Ackman has lost the ability to slide enemies along the ground, but he can now move while holding a stunned enemy.</desc>

	<name>Gokujou Parodius</name>
	<desc>Konami's Gradius and space-shooter parody series continues with this second installment.  Gameplay is similar to the Gradius series in that you control a ship that can move anywhere on the screen while the screen itself scrolls from left to right. Enemies appear in waves and destroying all the fighters in a single wave releases power-ups which may be used to choose your ships upgrade. The Upgrade bar too is lifted from Gradius, however each character has different names and functions for their upgrades.

In Gokujyou Parodius, you are now able to now choose from 11 different characters... many of whom appear from other Konami games. They include:

1. Vic Viper: a ship from Gradius

2. Takosuke: the "octopus" of the previous Parodius game, and also seen in at least one Goemon

3. Twinbee: making his appearance from the Twinbee side scrolling games, Twinbee is a squat round robot with a jetpack and a disproportionately big punching glove

4. Pentaro: the original "joke character", Pentaro made an appearence in a previous Gradius title as a flying penguin. However he does star in his own games as well, Konami's Penguin Adventure

5. Hikaru: Hikaru is a girl in a tight fighting "bunny suit" who is riding on top of a missile

6. Mambo: Mambo is a strange looking fish with two horns on the top of his head and on his underside

7. Michael: some kind of fat angel pig. He has wings and a golden halo over his head

8. Koitsu: A blue stick man riding on a surfboard. He's probably one of the more 'normal' characters

9. Goemon: star of the Goemon series of games. Goemon is a ninja warrior equipped with wooden pipes. He flies around in a superman pose for his appearance in Parodius

10. Dracula: star of Konami's Kid Dracula, this white haired squat character retains his vampiric abilities including that of being able to change into a bat

11. Upa: a flying baby. Upa is actually from a Konami game by the name of Bokutte Upa but is probably just more recognizable as "the flying baby" of this crazy shooter

In addition to your player-character, the levels themselves will be full of a strange mix of Konami references, bright colors and the just plain zany. it's not uncommon to have to fly your ship underneath a woman's legs for example or chased by a giant walrus or having enemies shooting cute pink hearts at you.</desc>

	<desc>In Gourmet Sentai: Bara Yarou the player picks from three characters: Bonjour, Mademoiselle, and Très Bien. Each has slightly different movesets to use on downed or stunned opponents, but each posses the punch, throw, and jump usual for belt-scrolling brawlers. The characters must get past several minor enemies on each level before fighting a stronger boss at the end. Each enemy will drop a cooking ingredient when defeated, and at the end of each level two ingredients can be combined to make a meal that will restore some health based on if the chosen character likes it or not. Environments range from slums and palaces to high speed trains and space ships, but in general there is not much continuity between different areas.</desc>

	<path>./GT Racing (Japan).sfc</path>
	<name>GT Racing</name>
	<desc>GT Racing is a Super Famicom racing video game where the player gets to drive a Gran Turismo car in either championship or practice mode.  The game is based on the 1996 Super GT racing season using the horsepower standards and rules of the era.  

During championship mode, the player is asked enter a number, his or her driver's name, and the team name that he or she will use during the championship. The driver's name and team can be entered using either English or Japanese letters. When a player beats a record, he or she is asked to insert his or her number, name or initials (up to four characters and two digits for the number). Championship mode can last for multiple seasons. Playing ninety-nine seasons in a single racing career is theoretically possible due to the double-digit nature of the season information. There are eight different tracks, including the Suzuka Circuit that has been shown in video games since Pole Position II and Fuji Speedway (complete with a virtually photorealistic Mount Fuji in the background).

Versus mode is for two human players only and the record options allows the players to look at his or her previous records. In a race, there are up to fifteen opponents to race against. The player gets rewarded with an opportunity to upgrade his or her equipment after a top five finish on any race course. Bonus equipment includes a faster engine, better tires, and a special dose of nitrous oxide created specifically for Gran Turismo vehicles. All of the bonus automobile parts are automatically installed in the appropriate parts for supercharging the vehicle. Once all the special parts are earned, the automobile is considered to be fully upgraded. The ultimate goal is to win the Gran Turismo championship for his or her team in addition for him/herself.

The "free practice" is essentially a time trial mode where the player races by him/herself for up to ten laps. Acquiring damage is still possible either crashing into walls or through normal wear and tear. The fastest lap time gets captured for the record book just like in the other modes of the game. Before being able to practice freely, the player can also choose the weather condition and the setup of his vehicle</desc>

	<name>Hameln no Violin Hiki</name>
	<desc>In Violinist of Hameln you play the role of Hamel, a sort of wanderer / adventurer whose weapon is a violin. His music can cover enemies in fear, or even control their minds. Hamel and his mascot Oboe arrives at Staccato, a small town attacked by monsters, and drives them away with his power. Impressed, a cute little girl named Flute decides to go with Hamel in order to find and destroy the evil power behind the attacks.

The game is typical platform. You play as Hamel, and with your violin can shoot musical notes to beat your enemies. However, you count with Flutes aid. Flute follows you (although you can order her to stop and stay), but also can be grabbed and thrown at the enemies (yes, thrown at the enemies). Flute can also collect through all the stages some costumes that, when worn, give her special abilities, such as flying, leaping, breaking walls or even explode and kill all in screen. At the end of each stage, of course, youll find the typical boss, all named as musical instruments.

	<name>Hat Trick Hero 2</name>
	<desc>Hat Trick Hero 2 is the follow up to Hat Trick Hero, and it is loosely based on the arcade game Hat Trick Hero '93. One or two players can play in a exhibition game (one single match) or in a world league. The game scrolls horizontally uses mode 7 graphics to give the playing field some perspective.

There are 18 countries to select from, each with different running, kicking and technical abilities. You can use 5 different formations, which are 4-4-2, 4-3-3, 3-5-2, WM and libero. You also select a team captain from 8 different characters.

You can perform a foul tackle on the opponent, but when the referee is close enough to notice it you risk getting a yellow or red card. By holding down a direction after shooting the players can shoot the ball with curve effect. During the game a power-up bar is charged which can be used for special abilities. Holding down R allows you to run faster, but this slowly drains the power-up bar. With a fully charged power-up bar you can perform an unstoppable hyper shoot by pressing a special combination, and this drains the power-up bar entirely.</desc>

Cast into the role of a young boy from a remote village, you live a peaceful life until one day the pigs in your village go crazy, and as a result you are thrown underground, only to be saved by mysterious fairies. Something goes wrong, and the world as you knew it doesn't exist any more. You must establish contact to the great gods and other famous characters from the Greek mythology in order to restore the balance.

Like the previous games of the series, this is a standard console-style RPG with turn-based combat viewed from first-person perspective. There is a day/night cycle, which influences not only the appearance of the world map and the towns, but also the schedules of the world's inhabitants.</desc>

The background story is based on the manga/animé of the same name. The years is 199X, and the world lies in ruins. Technology can no longer be used, and the land is controlled by fighters of rivaling styles. In this game, you can choose one of the fighter characters of the series: the main hero Kenshiro, his brother and rival Raou, Nanto Seiken fighters Rei and Souther, the assassin Heart, and others. You fight one-on-one, filling an energy bar and performing various attacks and techniques. There is a free fight mode where you choose your opponent yourself, and a two-player mode.

	<desc>Similar to the  sixth installment of the series, this is a fighting game along the lines of Street Fighter or Mortal Kombat. It is based on the main storyline of the manga/animé series Hokuto no Ken, also known as Fist of the North Star. 

After a terrible disaster mankind has stopped advancing the technology, and the world became a huge wasteland, controlled by fighter organizations. The main hero, Kenshirou of the Hokuto Shinken school, falls in love with a girl named Julia, who is abducted by one of the Nanto Seiken fighters, Shin.

In battle mode, the player participates in a tournament by choosing one of the characters. 
In free fight mode, the player choses characters as well as the opponents. During battles, the player must first accumulate energy in order to unleash devastating techniques unique to each character.

	<name>Holy Umbrella: Dondera no Mubo</name>
	<desc>In "Holy Umbrella", you control a schoolboy who lives in modern-day Japan. One day, the sky suddenly turns dark blue, a heavy rain falls onto the city, and the boy finds, halfway between his house and the school, an umbrella which seems to have fallen from the sky. What he does not know is that the umbrella is magical! The moment he touches it, he is transfered to a parallel universe. Immediately, he is attacked by a huge tank, but a strange old man with a talking bird saves him. It seems that an evil creature named Dondera is threatening the country with the terrible monsters she created. But is it really so? You visit the capital town, talk to the emperor, and decide to investigate the matter...

"Holy Umbrella" is essentially a platform action game, but unlike most other games of this genre, it allows you to visit towns, where you control your hero in a standard RPG-like top-down fashion. You can enter houses, talk to townspeople, etc. On platform levels, which are the main part of the game, you have to switch between the hero, the talking bird Bonto who accompanies you on your quest, and the girl Saki, whom you meet later in the game. Every character has his/her own special abilities and own ways of fighting: the hero can slide through air by using the umbrella, Bonto can double-jump on high ledges, Saki can jump on walls, etc. You use your umbrella as a weapon, as well as elemental stones you can collect on your way and throw at enemies. You also find various power-ups and items you can equip on the hero.</desc>

	<name>The Iron Commando</name>
	<desc>Iron commando is a brawler beat-em-up like Final Fight or Streets of Rage with lots of weapons and big end bosses.

The B-movie story is cheesy and does nothing more than accommodate for the action. From the introduction sequence: "The peril came from outer space. A meteorite entered the earth's atmosphere bringing chaos. After observation, the scientists found that the meteorite was radioactive and had to be destroyed. Unfortunately, terrorists from g.h.o.s.t. want the meteorite too. The Iron Commando's mission is to retrieve the deadly body and avoid genetic mutation."

The player or players walk along the levels beating up enemies. On some levels you ride a motorcycle or jeep, even a mine kart, and shoot your way through hordes of enemies. There are several end bosses, some are screen filling like a helicopter and a giant robot.

Some enemies will drop food, grenades or weapons as you beat them into a bloody pulp. There are lots of different Weapons: 9mm guns, shotguns, machine guns, knives, baseball bats. The weird thing is, enemies that use a sword and even dogs will occasionally drop a machine gun or baseball bat.

	<desc>Jaleco Rally: Big Run: The Supreme 4WD Challenge is a rally racing game and sim in which the player takes part in the Paris-Dakar rally. The game actually begins in Tripoli, Libya and passes through around 2,500 miles of African desert, swamp and jungle on the way to Dakar.Jaleco originally developed the game for the Arcades before porting it to the Super Famicom. This home version was never released outside of Japan. The game was also ported to the Amiga and Atari ST, where it is known simply as Big Run.GameplayIn addition to passing each checkpoint under the required time - the checkpoint system ubiquitous in solo racing games of the era - the player must also be aware of environmental dangers along the course and needs to select a sponsor, navigator and engineer team before starting. They must also balance the weight of their car, as too few replacement parts might cause a problem further into the race yet having too many will greatly reduce the car's top speed.</desc>

	<name>Smart Ball</name>
	<desc>The game involves going through 8 stages (broken up into two parts each) of side-scrolling action. At the end of each stage is a boss monster that must be disposed of.

Jerry moves by sliding across the ground and can latch on to walls and climb them. Jerry can also jump, stretch out to cling to ceilings, and also move at a faster pace. Jerry can consume balls that he finds during a stage and can then fire them out of his body at enemies blocking his path. Enemies can also be defeated by jumping on them and then flattening Jerry's body on them. Also, there are flowers that contain items for Jerry to collect. Items include life, which refills health, a 1-up that adds an extra life, and a seed, which will grow a climbable beanstalk when planted. If the player collects the scattered letters that appear in every stage that spell out the name Jerry, the player will earn two extra lives.</desc>

	<path>./Jikkyou Oshaberi Parodius (Japan).sfc</path>
	<name>Jikkyou Oshaberi Parodius</name>
	<desc>The third in the Paroidus series, it's the same gameplay and zaniness that substantiated the first two games. Gameplay itself is a copy (a parody rather) of Konami's famous Gradius series in that the screen scrolls from left to right (most times) and you maneuver around the screen destroying waves of enemies and avoiding obstacles. Unlike previous Parodius titles, this game contains a difficulty adjustment option, allowing the player to make things easier... or harder. Also unique to this parodius title is a bit of japanese digital voice that shouts out various things at you while you play. Survival throughout the level earns you a boss fight, which frequently includes some of the strangest characters in the game. Make no mistake, this *is* Gradius,  but with all sorts of strange graphics, music and references to other Konami games... So in other words, it's Parodius!

There are now more power-ups than ever including the standard power-up (red, used to upgrade weapons), the shield power-up (blue) and a variety of different coloured bells. Green Bells will make you huge on the screen, Yellow Bells are worth points (points in turn are worth extra lives), Blue Bells are "big bombs" that clear the screen of enemies/shots and can be saved until you need them, White Bells will give your character a megaphone that will shout out japanese phrases, the characters of the phrases themselves can be used to damage enemies (the power of words!), The Red Bell stockpiles you with three point-defense lasers... only one of which can be activated at a time and disappear after a short while. Finally the purple bell will clear the screen of all but the strongest enemies... and will turn them into power-ups.

This time around there are 16 different characters to chose from and the power-ups and weapons that they use are more unique than ever. Several familiar "faces" return and they've brought along friends to share in the party:
Vic Viper: The "gradius ship" appears once again in this gradius parody, equipped with it's traditional gradius weapons
2. Lord British: The "other" Gradius ship and arguably the more famous of the two. Lord British has weapons similar to Vic but quite different also.Missiles and shields work differently for instance. And Lord British uses a Ripple gun instead of a double shot.
3. Pentaro: It just wouldn't be a Parodius game if Pentaro wasn't involved. Originally from Konami's Penguin Adventure, Pentaro retains the same abilities from previous Parodius games... however his Potion weapon may now hit multiple enemies and his normal weapon shots explode against obstacles
4. Hanako: Also from Penguin Adventure, Hanako the penguin is Pentaro's girlfriend. While Pentaro is blue, she is the red penguin. She plays nearly identical to Pentaro with the exception of her S. Bomb weapon
5. Twinbee: Twinbee, from the Twinbee games is another returning Parodius star. Unfortunately he hasn't been upgraded since previous games, so his weapons are nearly identical; Punching Glove Rocket and all...
6. Winbee: Winbee, also from Twinbee is red and has moves identical to Twinbee, except for one difference... when she has 3 Options available, she can power them up to harm enemies that touch them.
7. Tako: Again, it just wouldn't be a parodius game without a flying octopus. And here he is, still wearing a baseball cap, but otherwise unchanged from previous Parodius games.
8. Belial: A yellow female octopus with a bow in her hair, she is identical to Tako with the exception of her Missile and Double weapons... which are instead identical to the Vic Viper.
9. Soitsu: A stickman (now green) surfing aboard a paper airplane, Soitsu plays similar to Koitsu from the previous game, aside from his colour. His laser weapon is able to charge up to deliver more power and he drops little stickmen onto the ground which occasionally dance around rather than attacking. Additionally he has an "upgrade power" (S. Power) that make all his other abilities stronger
10. Doitsu: Similar to Soitsu but with a Double Laser ability. He is an orange stickman riding on a paper airplane and no "upgrade" power, using normal options instead
11. Upa: Upa aka The Flying Baby is back from the previous Parodius game (as well as his original game, Bokutte Upa) and plays nearly the same. Instead of a shield, he has a Mega Crush power that damages all on-screen enemies... and also has an "Upgrade Power" in the form of Grade Up that makes his other abilities stronger.
12. Rupa: Another flying baby (presumably also from Bokutte Upa), Rupa plays similar tot Upa but with a Multi Spread gun which fires missiles in multiple directions (with each upgrade) and a S.Vulcan gun which automatically aims towards enemies.
13. Mike: A cute little kitten who happens to to have a very powerful wave weapon which can travel through obstacles and enemies. Additionally he has a multiple bomb ability which requires his "upgrade ability" (Grade Up) to get really powerful
14. Rani: Another cute kitten (this one rolled onto his bottom facing forward) with very power weaponry. Some of the highlights include a Reflect weapon wherein the shots bounce off of obstacles. Another is the S laser which travels forward but then homes in Up or Down to hit the enemy. And finally, Rani's missile weapon is two homing bells. Rani also has an "upgrade ability" in the form of Grade Up, however it only upgrades the Reflect Shot.
15. Memim: One of the fairy characters, Memim is a female flying girl with standard female bikini clothing. She carries some unique missile weapons however, whose direction is determined by Memim's current location on the screen when fired.
16. Sue: The other fairy with tight clothing, Sue is unique in that her weapons are upgraded/displayed in a different order from everybody else's in the game. For instance her Option is the 4th weapon on the list rather than the 6th... requiring less power-ups to activate it. However aside from that... all of her weapons are the exact same as the Vic Viper's.</desc>

Select your character with his unique stats and movesets, and go at it against any opponent from four fictional leagues with dozens of moves, submission holds and rope maneuvers in or out of the ring.

The game uses pre-rendered 2D sprites and features Vs, Tournament, and League play for up to four players. Also included is a career mode where you create a wrestler and control each aspect of his career up to his final victory in the inter-league tournament. And you can also configure matches to be standard, tag (with 4 or 6 wrestlers), submission or death-matches which adds such features as live wires and explosives to the ring.</desc>

	<name>Jojo no Kimy na Bken</name>
	<desc>One of the earliest titles based on the animé series Jojo's Bizarre Adventures, this game is not a pure fighter, like Capcom's more known title, but an adventure/RPG hybrid with turn-based fights.

In a futuristic world, there lives a young man named Jojo who holds a terrible power within: the power to drain life from enemies. This power is somehow connected to the evil vampire Dio who is terrorizing the world. Jojo must find faithful companions on his quest to restore peace and to master the power within himself.

In this game, you navigate Jojo in an adventure-like fashion, viewing the hero from third-person perspective. You can call up a menu at any time to choose a command such as "Look", "Talk", etc. Being a Japanese adventure, the game doesn't contain puzzles. from time to time, you'll be attacked by enemies and will fight them in turn-based combat viewed from first-person perspective. Jojo and his party members possess the so-called "stands", super-powerful creatures you summon during fights. before each fight, you'll have to choose one of fice available tarot cards to determine the amount of luck and compatibility of the stands you'll have in the game.</desc>

	<name>Jutei Senki</name>
	<desc>Jutei Senki is a turn-based strategy game, never released outside of Japan. The game takes place in an alternate universe where centuries ago humanity and their tree soldiers called Junei fight against Letum, a race of robots powered by magic.

The player commands the human army. The mission in each battle is to defeat the enemy army or take their headquarters in a limited amount of turns. In the human army's main building, the player can recruit new soldiers, but their number is limited. Each unit has its own statistics, including range, speed and attack power. Battles are carried out automatically, with animations on a separate screen.

There are three mission modes which include Campaign, Tutorial, and Expert modes and there is also a two-player versus mode.</desc>

	<desc>Kikou Keisatsu Metal Jack is a scrolling brawler based on the anime of the same name. At the start of the game the player can choose from Red Jack, Silver Jack, or Blue Jack. Red and Silver both have weapons they can find ammo for in levels (a gun and baton, respectively), and all three can do a multiple hit combo or a jumping attack. At the end of a level the Jack will be met by his vehicle which will then merge with his armor. In this form the Jack's attacks are strengthened and he can charge up an attack that hits every enemy onscreen.

There is no story told at any point in the game, so if you want to know what's going on you'll have to track down the anime.</desc>

	<name>Kishin Douji ZENKI: Battle Raiden</name>
	<desc>Once already Chiaki and her reluctant demon servant Zenki have saved the world from the forces of darkness, but apparently once is never enough. Chiaki has a vision of five cloaked figures and knows that only she and Zenki can stop them. At once they set off to track down the demon leaders.

In Kishin Douji ZENKI: Battle Raiden the player takes the role of Zenki. At first, and occasionally through the game, Zenki will be in his powered down form where he can only punch, jump, and dash. After Chiaki recovers her bracelet, or regains her concentration, or whatever she needs to do at the time, she can transform Zenki into his powered up form. In this form Zenki deals more damage and has a much longer list of attacks that get added to as the game progresses, such as a pillar of energy, an electrified punch, and a dashing attack. By picking up scrolls Zenki can do a powerful Rudora attack to all enemies on screen, but this attack damages Zenki as well.

To complete platforming levels Zenki will have to make it to the end of the level while occasionally finding hidden stone monuments that, when destroyed, will drop items as well as alter the level or remove obstacles, allowing Zenki to pass. After a stage's first platforming level is a midboss fight, and after the second platforming level is the boss fight proper.</desc>

	<name>Kouryuu Densetsu Villgust - Kieta Shoujo</name>
	<desc>This game is based on the animé series Villgust. The main hero of the game is Shun, a teenager who lives in modern-day Japan. One day, when he was going back from school with his girlfriend Michiko, Shun noticed a strange red-eyed rabbit. When he tried to follow him, Shun suddenly found himself all alone in a forest clearing. He was immediately approached by a group of four adventurers who said they were members of a group called R.A.G.E. (Resistance Against God of Evil). Apparently, Shun was transported into a parallel medieval world, and an evil organization known as Vile was the one behind Michiko's kidnapping. Shun and his friends will now do anything to help Michiko and to destroy Vile!

This is a traditional console-style RPG. You travel on the world map, visit towns, buy equipment and items, descend into dungeons, and fight random enemies in turn-based combat viewed from a third-person "over-the-shoulder" perspective. The party can hold up to five characters. The characters level up in a standard way, and also get experience and new levels for their magical spells.

	<name>Kunio no Oden</name>
	<desc>Another tournament rocks the streets around the Nekketsu High area, and you know Kunio and his gang aren't going to let an opportunity to prove how baddass they are pass them by.

The tournament this time is an eating contest, and the game itself plays like a block-lining puzzle game in the grand tradition of Tetris and Puyo Puyo. You must line-up blocks of the same type as they fall in the classic rectangular play area, clearing them before time runs up or they fill the entire screen. Features a 1P tournament mode, and a 2P competitive Vs mode in which you can chain blocks and send them to your opponent as "attacks" in hopes of causing him/her to lose.</desc>

	<name>Kunio-kun no Dodge Ball da yo: Zenin Shgo</name>
	<desc>16-bit sequel to the cult-classic Super Dodge Ball which unfortunately only saw a Japanese release.

The game continues the "Worldwide Dodge Ball tournament" motif of the original in which several teams from around the world compete in side scrolling dodge ball matches to see which one is the best. Gameplay is similar to other sport games in which you control the character that has the ball at the time (although a lead character always marks the formations and generally controls the team), and special moves can be executed to try and eliminate your opponents (such as homing throws and other esoteric moves). 

This sequel also adds more comprehensive tournament mechanics, for instance your performance in each match allows you to buy power-ups and special moves to enhance your players, you can also create a custom team and manage them throughout the tournament by adding or removing members as you see fit (you can even try to lure players from opposing teams). You can also choose among a series of formations and AI profiles in case you play alone, although you can use a multi-tap to play with up to 4 players.

Available game modes include Tournament, Vs and Mechabutsuke mode which is a variation on Vs that involves a free-roaming court and no outfielders.</desc>

Now Gulliver swears revenge and embarks, together with Misty and Edison, on a grand journey that will take him to several cities and countries all over the world, from Rome to Himalaya.

The game is an action RPG in which you can switch characters.

	<name>Laplace no Ma</name>
	<desc>1924, the town Newcam, Massachusetts. On the outskirts of the town stands the Weathertop mansion. It was just an ordinary place until the last owner, Benedict Weathertop, started practicing black magic. He killed his parents and populated the mansion with all kinds of undead. Since then, nobody dared to approach the mansion. But a short while ago, two boys were found dead near this horrible place. Apparently, the boys had tried to enter the mansion. Another evidence pointed out that a girl followed them - but her body hasn't been found yet, and there is a slight hope she might be alive. 
This is where you, the hero of the game, decide to investigate the mystery, and to venture into the mansion...

"Devil of Laplace" is a hybrid between survival horror and traditional Japanese RPG, similar to the pioneer of this genre, Sweet Home for NES. Unlike "Sweet Home", this game has less puzzles and is more oriented towards RPG elements. You are not stuck in the mansion, but can leave it, visit the town, and buy supplies. Later you also visit other locations such as a castle, etc. The battles are random, turn-based, and are viewed from first-person perspective. The hero of the game can recruit three other characters to the party of five available. Each character (including the hero, to whom you assign gender and class) belongs to one of the five character classes: Dilettante, Medium, Detective, Scientist, or Journalist. Dilettante is an all-around character with defensive magic, Medium is a kind of a black mage, Detective is a melee fighter, Scientist can construct powerful machines to perform various techniques, and the Journalist can take pictures of the monsters, which is the only way to gain money in the game.</desc>

	<name>Lennus II: Fin no Shito</name>
	<desc>This is a follow-up to the game "Lennus", which is know outside of Japan as  Paladin's Quest. The game is set in a world of Andell - a floating continent where ancient prophecies and highly advanced technology co-exist. A curse has fallen onto Andell - its four island, once united, are now separated, and are floating away from the heart of the continent, the temple of Andell. The sages of the temple summon a great hero named Farse, who must find a special magic orb for each one of the islands, which is the only way to re-unite them. Farse embarks on his journey, aided by three Terranos, the big-eared inhabitants of Andell.

This is a console-style RPG where you control a party containing the main hero Farse and three Terranos you select out of the available five. You encounter random enemies and bosses and fight them in turn-based combat viewed from first-person perspective. You can use special attacks and magical spells, which don't consume magic points, but take away a certain amount of your hit points. Instead of healing items, you have mini-bottles you can refill with potions in special places in towns. You can equip various magical artifacts which will allow you to use magic spells belonging to eight different elements.</desc>

	<name>Little Magic</name>
	<desc>May is an apprentice mage at Magic School and must pass the final exam.

A puzzle game seen from a top-down perspective. The goal of each level is to open the exit by pushing a magic stone on a designated spot. May can also push objects one tile ahead without moving herself. This is often used to get the stone over water that she can't cross herself. May's other ability is to create magic bubbles. She can create bubbles in three different sizes. Bubbles will pop after a certain amount of time, depending on their size. If they pop while next to the stone or another bubble, the stone or bubble will be moved one space. Since May can create several bubbles simultaneously, it is possible, and often necessary, to create chain reactions to maneuver the stone into the desired position.

As the game progresses, levels become increasingly difficult and new hazards and enemies are introduced. Enemies follow a set movement pattern and can sometimes be stopped, but not destroyed by magic bubbles. Later levels are made more complicated by different types of tiles including: grass that slows down May, ice that May and the magic stone will slip over, spikes that destroy the stone if it is pushed into them, collapsing tiles that can only be walked over once, rune tiles on which May cannot create magic bubbles, teleporters and others.</desc>

	<desc>In "Live a Live", you control seven main characters and play through seven different stories set in seven different time periods: prehistoric age, medieval Europe, feudal Japan, a futuristic world with robots and weird machines, etc. Those stories appear to have no common points, yet after completing all of them, you'll see they are in fact connected - the worlds of all those characters are threatened by the same ultimate evil force.

The combat features many innovations compared to traditional console RPGs: your position on the battle field is important, and certain techniques can be used only from certain positions, and enemy attacks also affect only specific parts of the field. Out of the seven chapters, some have more battle-oriented gameplay, while others are more devoted to puzzle-solving and information-gathering.

The game is one of the least known Squaresoft products, and was never released outside of Japan.</desc>

Lode Runner Twin: Justy to Liberty no Daibouken is a side-scrolling platform game, adapted for the SNES from the original Lode Runner. However the atmosphere has changed to a lot more cartoonish and happy. Controlling either Justy or Liberty, the player is able to move back and forth, climb ladders, cross ropes and dig holes in some types of surface. The enemies then fall into these holes and the player can walk over them. The goal in each level is to get all the candy.

There is also a battle mode that puts Justy versus Liberty to see who can fetch the most candy.

	<desc>The game is set in the same universe and shares characters and storyline with  Puyo Puyo puzzle games. Unlike Puyo Puyo, Mado Monogatari is a Japanese-style RPG. You play Arle, a five-year old apprentice magician. She is attending a special kindergarten, and it is time for the Final Exam. At the same time, Arle receives a mysterious letter that tells her that if she finds eight magical gems and takes them to the Wizard Mountain, she'll be granted one wish. Arle decides to search for the gems which are scattered all over the world, and to overcome all the obstacles with her great magic power!

The game features random enemy encounters and turn-based combat, which takes place on a platform (Arle to the left, the enemies to the right). You can't perform physical attacks at all, and your only way of harming enemies is through magic. During the game, you learn a variety of magic spells, which can be upgraded later. In battles you can't see your own and the enemies' hit points, and have to act according to your intuition.

	<desc>This game is based on the anime and manga by manga artist CLAMP.

In the land of Cephiro, the world was kept in peace and harmony by the wishes of Princess Emauraude, the Pillar of Balance. But the evil priest, Lord Zagato, has kidnapped Emauraude, and Cephiro is being invaded by deadly beasts. If this continues, Zagato will gain complete control of Cephiro! The only ones who can stop him are the legendary Magic Knights...

And those Magic Knights are three young girls from Earth. Hikaru Shidou, Umi Ryuuzaki, and Fuu Hououjii have been plucked from modern-day Tokyo and brought to Cephiro by Emauraude, and they're the only ones who can defeat Zagato...as the Magic Knights!

This interpretation of the manga story is a traditional Japanese-style RPG. The player controls the three main heroines as a party; each one uses different weapons and learns various skills. Typically for the genre, the party roams the top-down world, visits towns, descends into dungeons, chats with non-playable characters, and fights randomly appearing enemies in turn-based style.</desc>

	<name>Majyuuou</name>
	<desc>Abel's daughter has been kidnapped by his former friend, Bayer.  Bayer has sold his soul to the devil, and sacrificed Abel's wife, in an attempt to resurrect the King of Demons.  With no other choice, Abel vows to save his daughter, no matter what the cost - even if it is his own humanity...

Majyuuou is a side-scrolling platformer for the Super Nintendo, taking influences from Castlevania and Contra. You play as Abel, intent on rescuing his daughter from the depths of Hell. As you defeat certain bosses, they will drop large, color changing gems. Pick up the gem, and you'll transform into either a red Harpy, a blue Dragon, or a green Lizard, depending on what color it is when you pick it up. Each demon type has its own special attacks.</desc>

Bouts are best two-out-of-three, and each character has both a life bar and a "Makendo" meter, which lets each character perform a variety of special attacks.

Peach and Yoshi should have been together with Luigi......but alas, the visage of Luigi was missing. Mario's group of three have separated to find lost little Luigi.

At once, the suspicious sound of an engine was in the air. I wonder what it could be? It was Wario riding his personal plane, the Bulldog, and it dropped a bucket from the sky.

"Whew, woosh!"

And suddenly, the bucket was a snug fit on Mario's head.

"Uwagh, I can't see in this thing!"

The sprite of the woods, Wanda, witnessed it. The petite pixie did not have the strength to remove the bucket on her own, but she desired to help somehow. Thus, Wanda sends Mario a signal with her magic wand, determined to reunite him with Luigi......</desc>

	<desc>Dr. Hell's robot army has destroyed Tokyo, and now only Kouji Kabuto, and the giant robot Mazinger Z, can stop them from taking over the entire world. Animated cutscenes between levels tell the story of the game.

The Mazinger Z comes with a full armory of anti-robot weaponry, from super-powered karate moves to missiles, Breast Fire, and its signature Rocket Punch. Special moves deplete a regenerating energy meter, while Rocket Punches can be preformed at any time, although Mazinger will be unable to punch until its arms return. Each level contains several varieties of enemies, all of them from the show and unique to each level, that must be defeated to progress. Some enemy robots will fire projectiles from a distance while others will rush in attempt to grapple the Mazinger, and sometimes more than one enemy must be fought at once. Enemies will drop healing items and occasionally an item that upgrades Mazinger's Rocket Punch to the Iron Cutter for a limited time. At the end of each level is a fight with a stronger boss robot with more dangerous attacks.</desc>

Your wish is to become a "hunter" - to kill monsters that roam the world and to receive rewards for that. The storyline and the gameplay basics remained unchanged in this remake. You fight enemies in turn-based combat, and use vehicles, such as your own personal tank Mosquito, to transport yourself through different areas, and to participate in battles. You can also buy equipment and upgrade your vehicles.

The remake features enhanced graphics and sound, background pictures for battles (they were black in the original), slightly different locations (more houses in towns, sometimes different layout of the towns and of the world map), and reduced difficulty level.</desc>

Miracle Girls is based on the characters of the manga and anime of the same name. The player starts the game by picking either Tomomi or Mikage, although they both have the same abilities. Either can jump or toss candy, which will render enemies harmless for a few seconds as they eat it. Enemies incapacitated in this way can be used as platforms. Hidden in levels are bombs that fill the screen with candy, turning any onscreen enemies into heart rings, fruit that increase health, and doors that lead to a celestial slot machine that can reward additional lives. At the end of each level is a different challenge with a boss, such as a top-down squirt-gun fight or a game of matching cards.</desc>

	<name>Monstania</name>
	<desc>The hero of the game is Fron, a sixteen-year old boy who lives on the island of Monstania. One day, strolling in the forest, he notices a strange light. The light lead him to a clearing, and then suddenly disappeared. But Fron realized what was the meaning of that light - it was a fairy! Of course, everybody knew that fairies had been long extinct, but Fron never believed in that. All his life he wanted to meet a real fairy, and now, when the opportunity has come, he firmly decides to find her. His girlfriend Tia helps him on the dangerous journey, during which they meet a mysterious little girl named Chitta, and get involved in a grand adventure, that will ultimately lead them to the battle against the dark force that threatens the whole Monstania!

"Monstania" has a somewhat unusual gameplay within the frames of console RPGs. You don't explore the world in the game: it is entirely linear and takes you to the next destination by itself (only at a few points you can choose where to go next by selecting an appropriate answer). Once within the location, you cannot leave it until you complete all your objectives there, which then take you to the next location. The objective is usually a large strategic battle. You navigate your party members on the battle field, attack with melee and long-ranged weapons, and use special technique which require action points. Unlike most other turn-based strategy games, an enemy makes a move immediately after you did the same with one of your characters, without waiting for the "enemy turn". The RPG element is not very significant: your characters level up automatically after each battle. There are also some puzzles to solve in certain locations.</desc>

	<name>Mystic Ark</name>
	<desc>Seven heroes from seven different Worlds. Seven heroes who were brought to a mysterious temple on a remote island and transformed into statues. Seven heroes who are chosen to bring harmony back to the universe: Miriene the witch (wizard), Lux the tetsujin (a race of iron people), Reeshina the grappler (monk), Tokio the ninja, Kamio the ogre, and Mesia the priestess. The seventh hero is you, the protagonist of the game - the knight Remeer or the female warrior Ferris. Your first task will be to release your companions from the statues they are locked in. You must travel to the Cat World and to retrieve an important artifact. But your main objective is to visit all the seven Worlds and to find seven mystic arks - the items that will re-unite those Worlds and bring peace to them.

"Mystic Ark" is a RPG closely connected to 7th Saga. You travel on overworld map, visit towns, buy equipment, and descend into dungeons. The combat is turn-based and viewed from a third-person "over-the-shoulder" perspective. The battles are not random: the enemies can be seen as white dots on your radar, and if you don't want to fight, you can sometimes outrun or avoid them. The game also contains elements of pure adventure: often you must investigate objects closely and use items from your inventory on them.</desc>

	<name>Nekketsu Tairiku: Burning Heroes</name>
	<desc>The young fighter Ryu was thrown out of his father's home, and this childhood trauma has been dominating his life ever since. His only wish is to surpass his father and to show him he has become a better fighter than him. Laila is a cheerful treasure hunter. She dreams only of valuable things, adventure, travels, and life in the capital city.  Gaou is experiencing a personal tragedy: he wants to discover the mystery of the disappearance of a woman he loved, Asuka, aided by his best friend Froz. Naaga is a girl who wears a heavy armor, which - as she thinks - will prevent her from losing any battle. At present, she has problems since she owes a million gold pieces to her guild. What do those heroes have in common? As their ways cross, they will find out they are in fact pursuing one and the same goal...

"Burning Heroes" lets you start as either one of the four characters. Each one starts in a different place and is seemingly absorbed in his/her personal quest, but as the game progresses, the four heroes meet each other. You should also find and "unlock" four other playable characters as you advance in the game. The gameplay system of "Burning Heroes" is similar to other console-style RPGs: you fight random enemies and bosses in turn-based combat, viewed from third-person perspective, like in Final Fantasy games. As you get hit in a battle, your "passion" (literally "hot blood", nekketsu in Japanese) level rises, and the more damage you take, the quicker you reach 100%.

	<name>Neugier: Umi to Kaze no Kodo</name>
	<desc>You play a man named Duke, the son of Count Wein of Neugier. Long time ago, Duke was exiled from the country by his father. Traveling in faraway lands, Duke heard that his homeland was under attack. He decided to return to Neugier. On the way his ship was attacked by pirates, lead by a mysterious demon named Ord. After he barely escaped the ship, Duke found his way into his father's castle. He realized now that the pirates' attack and the monsters roaming the castle are connected. Although his father doesn't trust him, Duke is determined to save Neugier.

"Neugier" is an action adventure game in which you fight enemies in real-time, slashing them with your melee weapon. You have a "throw chain" ability, which allows you to press objects to the walls, destroying them. You can also push enemies to the walls this way. Duke can also jump and equip armor you find sometimes in dungeons.

	<name>Ou-chan no Oekaki Logic</name>
	<desc>Ou-chan no Oekaki Logic is a digital conversion, with anime mascots, of the classic Japanese newspaper puzzle nonograms. A nonogram is a puzzle on a square or rectangular grid the object of which is to reveal a hidden picture. Along each row and column there is a number or series of numbers which indicate how many squares will be colored in that row or grid. Example; &amp;quot;5 9 4&amp;quot; would mean there would be sets of five, nine, and four colored squares in the grid, in that order, with at least one blank in between. 

Ou-chan no Oekaki Logic adds a story mode where Ou-Chan, representing the player, competes with other blobby anime characters in finding hidden images in the nonogram grids.</desc>

	<name>Tetris Attack</name>
	<desc>All is not well on Yoshi's Island! The devious king Bowser has cast a spell on the island's inhabitants, turning them into his mindless slaves. Only Yoshi has escaped its effects, and so he must set off to free his friends, and to defeat Bowser and break the spell.

Tetris Attack is a fact-paced action puzzler featuring the colorful cast of characters from Yoshi's Island. A stack of blocks continually rises from the bottom of the screen, and the player controls a cursor which can swap any two blocks horizontally. Make a row or column of three or more and they'll clear, potentially creating combos from new blocks falling to take their place. Combos will send large garbage blocks to your opponent, which must be eliminated by clearing a piece that is touching it, turning it into normal blocks.

The game offers a story mode against the computer, as well as a 2-player versus mode, an endless mode, a timed mode where a certain number of blocks must be cleared, and a puzzle mode where a set arrangement of blocks must be cleared in a specific number of moves. The game is based on the Japan-only title Panel de Pon.</desc>

	<path>./Pipe Dream (Japan).sfc</path>
	<name>Pipe Dream</name>
	<desc>Each level of this abstract puzzler challenges the player to set up a network of pipes to allow an unspecified substance known as 'flooz' to flow through as many of those as possible. The pieces are offered in random order, and there are seven different types - straight lines going horizontally or vertically, corners rotating in each of the four directions, and cross-over pieces which carry the flooz straight across horizontally and vertically. Each of these can be entered from either side. When the flooz hits a gap, or a piece which the previous piece can't flow into, the pipe is finished.

Before the flooz starts flowing from its randomly-selected starting position, the player has several seconds to start placing pieces. They can be put down anywhere. However a situation that can often occur is there will be a long and complex piping arrangement set up, yet a gap somewhere remains to be filled. Players are able to replace a piece with another in the same square (to make it easier to flow the flooz that way), but for a slight scoring penalty.

Bonuses are awarded for looping the flooz through both sides of at least 5 cross-over pieces, or passing the flooz through every square on the screen. Later levels have some squares on the grid blocked off, a few gaps in the side-wall (allowing flooz to thread to the other side of the screen). After every four levels there is a bonus game for points, in which the player can only place the pieces in the lowest open space in each column, similarly to the board game of "Connect 4".</desc>

	<name>Popful Mail</name>
	<desc>In this platform action game, you play as a cute bounty hunter known as Popful Mail. While you might think that a cute Anime chick would have no trouble making a living slashing bad guys with her sword, Popful is having a hard time making ends meet.  One day, however, Popful learns about a magician who has gone rogue and has a hefty bounty on his head. So, her adventure begins as Popful fights her way through a new adventure, and makes new friends along the way.

Primarily this is an action game with very slight RPG elements. As you make your way through the plethora of levels, you will have to collect money from slain foes. You use this money in the shops to buy weapons, armor, health, and so on. Also, this game features interaction with many, many characters through both on-screen dialog and fully animated sequences. Some of these characters become playable as you progress through the game.

This release has the same story and general gameplay style as the earlier version, but otherwise was made from scratch, having entirely different graphics, locations, enemies, challenges, etc.</desc>

	<path>./Ranma 1-2 - Akanekodan Teki Hihou (Japan) (Translated En).sfc</path>
	<name>Ranma 1/2 : Hidden Treasure of the Crimson Cats</name>
	<desc>The game is based on the animÃ© series Ranma 1/2. It tells the story of the young martial artist Ranma Saotome. Traveling with his father Genma across China, Ranma discovered a cursed spring. When he and his father fell into that spring, they were both transformed: Ranma into a little girl, Genma into a panda bear. Hot water restored them to their original appearance, but whenever they are splashed with cold water, they turn into their "cursed" forms. 

The story of the game begins as Ranma and Genma are having breakfast by their friends. Suddenly, several cat-like creatures burst in and kidnap Genma. Ranma finds out that the cats belonged to Akaneko (Crimson Cat) Gang, who kidnaps strong fighters for some reason. Soon Ranma discovers that Kamusaru, the leader of the Crimson Cat Gang, is looking for an ancient treasure that will allow him to turn into a Nekomaou (Cat Demon King), and take over the world. Ranma and his friends will do anything to rescue Genma and to stop Kamusaru's evil plans!

The game features many characters from the animÃ©, including Ranma's fiancee Akane, the fighter Ryouga, the amazon warrior Shampoo who is in love with Ranma, and others. The game is built like a traditional Japanese RPG: your party fights random enemies in turn-based combat viewed from a third-person, Final Fantasy-like perspective. In battles, you can attack physically, or use various offensive and defensive techniques, which consume "ki" (an equivalent of magic points). Not only Ranma and Genma, but also the other characters in your parties can take a different shape. You carry around a bucket of cold water, and every time you use it on one of your characters, he/she is transformed into a "cursed" form. This is sometimes required to advance the story of the game (for example, Ranma can enter a certain location only as a girl).

	<name>Ranma 1/2 : Hard Battle</name>
	<desc>Another fighting game based on the Ranma 1/2 manga series set around the misadventures of a martial artist that gets cursed and magically transforms into a female version of himself whenever he's splashed with water.

As in previous games the premise simply involves the cast of the series going at each other's throats for ultimate supremacy, although this time you can select any character in either the single player or Vs gameplay modes.

The gameplay itself involves controlling your character in a side-scrolling arena and trying to defeat your opponent either with your basic attacks, special moves (triggered by specific controller motions) or super moves that require you to charge buttons and can only be dealt under specific situations (ie, when your life-bar starts flashing), while avoiding your opponent's attacks in turn.

	<name>Ranma 1/2 : Chougi Ranbu Hen</name>
	<desc>A 2D one-on-one fighting game based on the Ranma 1/2 manga series dealing with the adventures of a male martial artist cursed to transform into a female version of himself when splashed with water.

Ranma 1/2 : Chougi Ranbu Hen pits 12 characters from the series (including the male and female versions of Ranma) against each other in best 2-out-of-3 rounds matches, with the goal being to defeat all the opponents and thus claim a magical lucky cat that will grant the champion whatever he wishes.

Gameplay involves controlling your character in a 2D scrolling arena, in which you attempt to defeat your opponent by using your basic attacks and special moves, all the while avoiding your opponent's strikes. You can also charge up your character until he reaches "super" mode, which allows you to unleash super moves for extra damage, but performing any basic attack negates the super mode.

Features the standard single player and Vs modes along with a Tag Team Vs mode in which two players select a pair of characters and can exchange them in mid-fight for strategic advantage.</desc>

	<name>Ranma 1/2 : Ougi Jaanken</name>
	<desc>The game involves falling blocks of hands displaying the rock, paper, and scissors signs, which fall three at a time. In a similar manner to Tetris, the player can rotate the blocks to stack them, using pieces that defeat other pieces (e.g. paper over rock) to eliminate stacks. Doing so adds garbage pieces onto the opponent's screen to make it more difficult for them to eliminate their stacks of blocks. The objective is to fill up the opponent's screen up with blocks so that additional ones can no longer fit. Each character has two special attacks which can be used when large combinations are completed. Once in each round each player can also use a bucket of water that can transform a cursed character into their alternate form, which weakens their attacks until the effect wears off. This does not affect Akane or the Gambling King.</desc>

	<desc>Multidirectionally scrolling action shooter. The main character runs through science fiction scenarios blasting away everything that moves. Starting with only a single shot,  5 different upgradable weapon systems can be collected as extras. Upon death, the last activated system loses one increment of its current upgrade status, but can be refueled by additional extras collected. Every weapon has also a massive 'smart' bomb feature, wiping out mostly everything on screen at once if invoked. There are also some R-Type style space shooter levels thrown in for good measurement. Very arcady with tons of action. Several boss monsters per level. Level progress is saved via password feature.

But remember, Dr. Wily is mad, but he's not stupid. He had a backup plan...and all he had to do was just wait...

6 months had passed, and somewhere from deep within Wily's abandoned lab, 4 hidden capsules activated and opened. His backup plan was in action...he had hidden 4 new Wily Robots that would spring him out of jail so he could continue his mad reign.

When Mega Man hears the word that Wily was busting out of prison, he rushes onto the scene, only to encounter a strange robot he had never seen before named Bass. Bass tells Mega Man to back off, that he would stop Wily, and that Mega Man was no longer needed.

Think that's gonna stop Mega Man? No way! Mega Man takes off to put a stop to Dr. Wily and find out exactly whose side Bass is on...</desc>

	<path>./Romancing SaGa (Japan) [En by Trans Dimension v0.40] (Incomplete).sfc</path>
	<name>Romancing SaGa</name>
	<desc>Once upon a time, three evil gods fought against the holy gods, and the holy God-Father chose a human warrior to help them. Finally, after a prolonged, terrible war, the leader of the three evil gods - Death, the eldest of them - surrendered. The youngest evil god, Schirach, became a human and has lost her powers. The middle one, Saruin, was sealed away in the dark world. Now, after thousand years have passed, and the seal of Saruin has weakened, it is time for you, the hero of the new generation, to defeat him.

Romancing SaGa is the fourth installment in the long SaGa series - non-linear role-playing games with several main heroes. It is the first of three Super Nintendo entries. The first three games in the series were on the Gameboy and were known as "Final Fantasy Legend" outside of Japan. In this game, you play the stories of eight characters, which will later unite to face the ultimate evil. The eight characters belong to different classes and have different abilities. There are four male characters (noble son, thief, adventurer, and pirate), and four female ones (nomad, ranger, dancer, and savage). The combat is turn-based, with enemies visible on screen. Taking a cue from Final Fantasy II on the NES, instead of "Leveling" your character as a whole you level specific abilities such as a type of weapon or magic, as well as, stats such as HP and Strength and Intelligence. New to this entry abilities are randomly unlocked during battle as a light-bulb appears over the characters head and the new ability is unleashed to the surprise of friend and foe. This serendipitous element of gameplay along with the multiple heroes to choose from greatly enhance the replay value as no two playthroughs are alike. Which is good considering the steep learning curve of the SaGa games which require multiple playthroughs to truly master the system.

"Romancing SaGa" was never released outside of Japan until the Playstation 2 remake "Romancing SaGa: Minstrel Song"</desc>

	<desc>Every 300 years the Death Eclipse kills all newly born creatures. Men, women, and children, animals and plants, even ferocious monsters - no one can survive the devastation caused by the Eclipse. No one except a child chosen by the destiny. 600 years ago, such a child survived the Death Eclipse, only to become a demon king. During the next Eclipse, a chosen child became a holy king, and he defeated the evil demon king. Now, when the next Eclipse is nearing, nobody knows who the next fortunate survivor will become - a demon or a holy man?

In "Romancing SaGa 3", you can play through the story controling any one of the eight main characters - Julian, Monica, Mikhael, Harid, Katarina, Thomas, Elena, and Sarah. The story is common for all eight characters, and they often join together and share the same piece of a story. The princess Monica learns about a rebellion planned by a treacherous Baron to dethrone her brother, Marquis Mikhael. She goes to warn him, but on her way, she loses her horse, and has to stop in an inn of the town Shinnon. There, she meets travelers who agree to lend her a horse and accompany her to see her brother. When they finally reach Mikhael, a war begins...

"Romancing SaGa 3" has a refined upgrading system: you can upgrade your weapons and your spells by using them continuously. The party combat is turn-based, and there are also strategic army-vs.-army battles you'll have to command.</desc>

	<name>Rudra no Hihou</name>
	<desc>The Earth is ruled by heavenly powers, who destroy it and create it again every 4000 years, to end the live of powerful races and to let new ones appear. Many years ago, four great races dominated the Earth: the wise Danans, the beautiful Mermaids, the proud Reptiles, and the strong Giants. But those races had to give place to a newly born race: the humans. During the era of the humans, the planet's air has become filled with smog and the water dirty with pollutants. The cult of the Rudra have appeared and begun fortelling the end of the world. As the 4000 year deadline approaches, three characters each embark on their separate yet intertwined quests.

Sion is a young warrior who wants to take part in a ritual tournament and become the strongest of the kingdom. However a capture of one of the Cultists of Rudras soon complicates his training.

Surlet is a wise magician who is interested in archeology and history of the Earth. He is also a pupil of the famous professor Muench who recently made a very important discovery regarding ancient ruins

Riza is a young druid who lives with her grandfather in a quiet village. She was born with a mysterious jade on her forehead, and now feels the urge to save the world from an inevitable, yet unknown disaster.

Rundra no Hiho is a turn-based RPG, similar in gameplay and graphics to the better known Final Fantasy VI. Whenever players load the game cartridge, they are able to choose which of the three characters they wish to play. This allows any one of these quests to be saved and put aside for any amount of time, allowing the player to change between characters as they so desire. Regardless of which character is chosen, the game is displayed as a top-view on the overworld and in towns. Players can move around to different locations, search treasure chests and talk to townspeople. On the overworld and in dungeons, random encounters can occur. During battles the game is displayed from a side-view and is turn-based between the player's characters and monsters. Players are able to Fight with their weapon, use mantras (magic), use items, defend or run away. Defeat of monsters will result in the party earning experience points and money, which can be spent to buy new weapons, armor and items.

The game's mantra (magic) system is unique in that all spells are formed up of syllables, each with it's own effect (for instance, the syllable "Ig" represents fire and the syllable "ga" augments any mantra's power over it's basic form. Therefore "Igga" is a more powerful version than "Ig" alone). Syllables must be arranged in proper combinations in order to form effective magic spells. Hints towards some of these combinations can be found inside treasure chests or by talking to townspeople.

	<name>Seiken Densetsu 3</name>
	<desc>Seiken Densetsu 3 is set in the same world as the two previous Seiken Densetsu games (the first is Final Fantasy Adventure, and the second is most known as Secret of Mana). The mysterious power of Mana is also the center of all events in Seiken Densetsu 3. Years have passed, and all the destructive powers of Mana have been securely sealed by Mana Swords into eight seeds, all placed in eight different kingdoms. But some people know about those sealed powers, and they don't want to free them for the sake of humanity, but for their own gain - such as the kingdom of Altena, which is slowly freezing and which can be saved only by the legendary powers.

The game features several plot lines connected to each other by their common background. In the beginning of the game, you are offered to choose a group of three among six different characters of different classes: Duran the Fighter, Angela the Magic User, Lisa the Amazon, Carlie the Cleric, Kevin the Grappler and Hawk the Thief. Each one of them has her/his own background story and dwells in a different land. Gradually, the connections between those different characters become apparent, and the seemingly loose story lines are connected into a whole.

Seiken Densetsu 3, like the previous game of the series, is an action RPG, with real time combat.</desc>

	<desc>A 2D side-scrolling beat 'em up, Sengoku casts you and a friend as two renegade fighters out to beat the crap out of the many assorted gangs that threaten the post-apocalyptic cities of the future. Unfortunately for them they also get caught in a time-warping scheme caused by the evil Nobunaga who attempts to invade the time period with mythical warriors and evil creatures from the Japanese sengoku period.

The game thus takes you from the city to a spirit-realm from time to time, in which you must fight all sorts of Japanese mythical figures, and release three haunted spirits that can aid you in your battle. Collecting orbs from defeated enemies allows you heal up, gain weapons and even energy attacks and also summon the warrior forms of the spirits you released, which change your character's form and give you a new collection of attacks and powers.

	<name>Shin Megami Tensei</name>
	<desc>A young man lives together with his mother in Kichijoji, a district in modern Tokyo. One day, he has a strange dream: he is being sucked into another dimension, a strange maze-like structure. A spirit appears in front of him and asks him his name. As he proceeds further, he meets a man who is hanging on a cross, another one who is being tormented by a demon, and a mysterious young woman who is bathing in a pool...

"Wake up!" - the voice of his mother cuts through the dream. The young man wakes up and checks his computer. Suddenly, a message arrives: the world is headed towards destruction. Only he who can summon demons through a virtual space will be able to prevent a disaster. What could that mean? The young man goes outside and finds out a murder has occurred in the nearby park. The district must be cut off from the rest of the city until the murderer is found. This was the beginning of the demon summoner's story...

"Shin Megami Tensei" is a first-person RPG set in modern-day and futuristic Tokyo. The hero of the game can summon demons, who use a mysterious energy called Magnetite. The demons can fight for you and perform other useful tasks. The first-person combat is turn-based. In the beginning of the game, you can set the statistics of your party members, determining their strength, stamina, intelligence, etc. You'll need to make some crucial decisions during the game, that will also influence the outcome of its events.</desc>

	<name>Shin Megami Tensei II</name>
	<desc>Shin Megami Tensei II is a direct sequel to the  first game. The events of this game take place 20 or 30 years after the hero of the first game followed the neutral path, defeated the Asura Lord and the seraph Michael at the Cathedral, and founded a state where followers of both Law and Chaos ideals could live freely. But his reign of freedom doesn't last long. The Mesia faith gains power, expanding the Cathedral into a new enclosed environment named Millenium. The Gaians rise up, but their rebellion is repressed by the Mesians' elite warrior class, the Temple Knights. Some years later, a retired arena fighter Okamoto discovers a man fighting for his life against a demon. He rescues the man, who doesn't even remember his own name, and trains him to fight in the arena so they might both go on to a better living in one of the upper-class areas of Millenium. And thus the new battle for a better future begins...

"Shin Megami Tensei II" features all the gameplay innovations of the previous game. You can summon demons, fuse them, make them battle for you, talk to random enemies and receive information from them, etc. The combat is turn-based, and you explore the dungeons from a first-person perspective view.</desc>

	<name>Shin Nekketsu Kouha Kunio-kun: Kunio-tachi no Bank</name>
	<desc>Another beat 'em up in the Nekketsu Kouha Kunio-Kun series. 
The eternal rebel Kunio and his pal Riki finally get to face the long arm of the law when they get both arrested for killing a couple of bystanders in a hit-and-run incident. Problem is they are innocent and the lookalike killers are still out there! Kunio and his pal now have to break out of the prison and go kick some butt in the name of justice (and to clear their names of course).

Gameplay involves defeating all opponents using your arsenal of attacks and special moves (as well as any weapons you may find around) and completing the many side scrolling stages that make up the game, usually after beating an end level boss.

Kunio and Riki are not alone in their quest, as their hard boiled girlfriends, Misako and Kyouko, can join up and provide their unique collection of special moves to the mix. Biking sequences in which you try to get to another part of town while fending-off opponents Road Rash-style are also added for additional gameplay and the game uses several non-interactive cutscenes and dialogues to carry the plot forward.</desc>

	<desc>Shounen Ashibe: Goma-chan no Yuuenchi Daibouken (lit: "Boy Ashibe: Goma-chan's Great Amusement Park Adventure") is a Super Famicom platformer from Nova Co. and Takara. The player alternates between controlling the human Ashibe, as he escorts his friends across a world map while talking to NPCs and following the game's story, and the seal Goma-chan in 2D platformer stages where he must track down eight items by investigating his surroundings thoroughly. While Goma-chan can't be hurt by enemies, colliding with them causes him to lose one of the eight items he's already found - as the stages have a strict time limit, it's best to avoid this situation whenever possible.

Shounen Ashibe was originally a Shounen Jump serialized manga before becoming an anime TV series in 1991, a year before this game was released.</desc>

	<desc>Shounen Ninja Sasuke ("Boy Ninja Sasuke") is a comedic brawler published by SunSoft exclusively for the Super Famicom. The player, as the eponymous ninja, must rescue the daughter of a local lord by fighting his way through hordes of masked bandits led by a mysterious warlord. A second player can join in as Sasuke's monk friend Chin-nan. The game has a distinct sense of speed and verticality, and it's recommended that the player(s) try running and jumping around performing aerial attacks rather than staying on the ground and getting quickly swarmed by enemies.The game was published by SunSoft and developed by an unknown developer, though Mint is thought to have contributed to its sound design. A US SNES localization, with the title Boy Ninja Sasuke, was briefly considered but then axed.</desc>

	<name>Slayers</name>
	<desc>"Slayers" is based on an manga series of the same name (also known as Lina the Teenage Sorceress). The heroine of the manga (and of the game) is Lina Inverse, a seventeen-year-old girl who can use magic and is also proficient with the sword. Lina particularly likes money, and often robs rich people and hunts for treasure. She also has a sense for justice - if a village or a town is in trouble, Lina will do anything to protect it and to fight the bad guys! In the game, Lina is knocked down after a fight against mysterious attackers, and is found by the inhabitants of the nearby village. The trouble is, she can't remember anything! When she meets her long-time companion Naga, their first objective become to investigate the goblin attacks on the population, but Lina's ultimate quest is to regain her memory and to find out who or what has attacked her.

The game is a traditional console-style RPG with towns, dungeons, random enemies, and turn-based combat viewed from first-person perspective, in a Dragon Warrior fashion. The characters can attack physically or use special attacks. Lina can also cast various magical spells. You cannot travel on the world map, but "jump" to various locations instead. The game features animé-style cut scenes.</desc>

	<desc>The game is a less of a self-contained game and more a collection of four smaller ones; including a point-and-click segment featuring Schroeder. The player controls Woodstock and direct Snoopy as he performs all sorts of errands for different Peanuts characters.

The ultimate goal in the game is to get everyone in shape for Snoopy's concert. Games can either be played using stereo or monoaural sound.

The music was composed by Hirokazu Tanaka (?????)[2] and Minako Hamano (??????),[2] in addition to arrangements of the familiar works of Vince Guaraldi known to longtime Peanuts fans. Many years later the game has been translated to English (by Aeon Genesis) and Portuguese.</desc>

The game is played from an isometric perspective from which you can get a good view of the mazes and Ebisumaru. You have no direct control of Ebisumaru per se, but instead switch special blocks around the mazes that can change Ebisumaru's direction of travel and such. You must reach the end of each stage before time runs out, and get all the power-ups and items laid in each maze in hopes of getting to Goemon alive.</desc>

	<name>Super Bomberman : Panic Bomber W</name>
	<desc>Super Bomberman - Panic Bomber W is one of the offsprings of the Panic Bomber Series. It was released for the Super Famicom and was only released in Japan. It features a single player mode and a multiplayer one that supports up to four players.
This game also implements a Dokuro mode which involves status effects. These can do everything from reduce blast radius to igniting bombs on screen.</desc>

	<name>Super Bomberman 4</name>
	<desc>The fourth addition to the Bomberman series for the SNES.  This game is almost identical to Super Bomberman 3 only with new levels and a new story.

A small twist in this game is that instead of choosing the traditional bomberman or a country specific character players get to choose between bosses from the previous game when playing battle mode. Each character has a special power from a jet pack to throwing abilities.</desc>

Again there is a new story and new battle arenas but other than that it is the same game.  Players choose between the bosses of the story game levels in battle games like in Super Bomberman 4 yet they have not special powers this time around.</desc>

	<name>Super Fire Pro Wrestling - Queen's Special</name>
	<desc>Long before the WWE introduced the Divas wrestling matches, in Japan there was a more serious affair, where wrestling skill was more important than breast implants, and matches were "real" (as far as wrestling goes) instead of pillow-fighting or bra and panties fights.

In this game in the Fire Pro Series, the cast of the All Japan Women's Pro-Wrestling promotion are available, all fighting to win the Red belt, the highest prize of the federation. It's also possible to fight in single matches, tournaments, Battle Royal and Elimination matches. The usual array of options in CAW is present, being possible to create 16 new Wrestlers.

Gameplay, as usual is the series, is dramatically different than in most western games. Each wrestler has a bunch of moves, ranked from weak to strong. While it's possible to connect any of them from open situations, while grappling only when the opponent is already beaten the most powerful moves can be successfully used.

	<name>Super Fire Pro Wrestling Premium X</name>
	<desc>In this final appearance of Fire Pro series on 16-bit consoles, the usual roster of over 150 wrestlers from several wresting promotions worldwide including several styles from Shoot or Pancrase to American and Lucha are joined by 80 Create-a-wrestler slots, plus secret wrestlers such as legends Gotch or Thesz or the roster of Blazing Tornado. While all fighters have fictional names, a lot of them are perfectly recognizable by their attire, stance and style. The CAW mode allows the player to create a wrestler from scratch, setting how they look (choosing face, size, clothing and setting colours) and fight, with several styles and stances available, as well as over 500 moves, each more suitable for certain styles and skills. To make them fight more realistically when controlled by the AI, the CAW mode also allows one to set move priorities.

Five game modes are available, including World Championship (single and tag), Battle Royale, 5-man Elimination Mode, League Battle and the One Night Dream Match. There are several referees available (each with their own quirks) and variant rules, from allowing fighting outside the ring without count-out (or disallowing it) to the disabling of disqualifications from illegal moves.</desc>

	<path>./Super Nazo Puyo - Rulue no Roux (Japan).sfc</path>
	<name>Super Nazo Puyo - Rulue no Roux</name>
	<desc>A spin-off of the successful action puzzle series Puyo Puyo with a twist. Whereas the main Puyo Puyo games are aimed at defeating AI or human controlled opponents in puzzle duels (where each player has his own play area in which color-coded "puyos" fall and must clear them out faster than his opponent). Nazo Puyo instead challenges the player with different single-player scenarios in which a specific objective must be completed (such as clearing only the red Puyos, or performing a specific sequence of combos, etc.).

The game uses the mold of a top-down RPG in which you control the young magician Arle as she explores towns and dungeons in her search for adventure. Each quest involves finding an NPC who will trigger one of the aforementioned scenarios and rewards Arle with experience points and unique items that increase her stats.

	<desc>Sequel to the original Super Nazo Puyo, SNP2 is a Puyo Puyo spin-off which combines arcade puzzle elements with RPG gameplay.

You play as the young magician Arle as she sets out looking for adventure all over the land, chatting with NPCs and exploring the game world via a standard top-down RPG interface. Quests involve careful exploration and solving Nazo Puyo challenges which involve specific scenarios of puzzle-based gameplay which the player must solve under a specific timeframe. These sequences give the player a play area in which color-coded "puyos" are pre-arranged in different patterns, and the player must position and arrange the ones that start to fall in order to fullfil the objective at hand (clear only a certain row or color of puyos, reach a certain number of combos, etc.). Additionally, running into specific monsters can trigger standard Puyo Puyo duels, in which both players have their own play areas and the objective is to clear the screen faster than the opponent.

	<desc>Super Sokoban (or Soukoban) is a puzzle game in which the player must push crates around a maze to their designated storage area, ensuring they do not accidentally push a crate into a position where it cannot be recovered. Thinking Rabbit created the original game in 1982 on home computers, and Super Sokoban is the first Super Famicom game to follow the same blueprint.

The intro establishes that the eponymous Sokoban, or warehouse worker, must perform enough box-pushing puzzles to earn enough cash for a flashy new car so that he might finally impress the girl of his dreams.

An added wrinkle is that each stage has a fixed move limit, and so the player must not only push the boxes in the right order but do so with maximum efficiency. The game was not released outside of Japan.</desc>

	<name>Super Tetris 2 + Bombliss</name>
	<desc>Super Tetris 2 + Bombliss is one of the many versions of the famous soviet puzzle game, the first one available for the Super Nintendo, and an updated version of Tetris 2 + Bombliss.

As the title would suggest, the game features both standard Tetris as well as another similar game called Bombliss. Tetris offers three game modes: standard marathon (A-type), start with garbage (B-type), and rising garbage (C-type). There is also a two-player versus mode where clearing rows sends garbage to the other player.

Bombliss is slightly different from normal Tetris. Arranged on the board and in some dropped pieces are bomb squares. Completing a row does not clear the blocks in the row, but will trigger any bombs in the row which will destroy blocks. Different sizes of bombs will generate larger explosions. Bombliss is offered in standard marathon mode, a puzzle mode where a set board must be cleared using set piece drops, and a 2-player versus mode.</desc>

	<name>Super Tetris 3</name>
	<desc>Super Tetris 3 is yet another version of the famous soviet puzzle game. However, despite what the title may suggest, contained within are actually four different versions of Tetris: Tetris Classic, Familiss, Sparkliss, and Magicaliss. Tetris Classic, of course, is the basic version of the game, which comes with an endless mode and a 25-line "standard" mode. Familiss, as the name might suggest, is a family mode for up to four players simultaneously. Sparkliss, meanwhile, is very similar to Bombliss from Super Tetris 2, only with a medieval fantasy theme and different explosion patterns. Sparkliss includes both a stage mode and a puzzle mode.

The most unique mode is Magicaliss, which has never shown up on any other version of Tetris. In Magicaliss, pieces come in three basic colors, and by rotating the piece, the player can choose between them. Creating a line entirely out of one color will clear all blocks on the screen of that color. There are also grey pieces, which can only be cleared by creating a line made entirely from one color, which will cause all grey blocks on screen to become that color. There are also rare rainbow pieces which will act as any color. Besides these additions, the game itself is basic Tetris.

Tetris Classic, Sparkliss, and Magicaliss can also be played in a two-player battle mode, besides the four-player Familiss mode.</desc>

	<name>Tales of Phantasia</name>
	<desc>In "Tales of Phantasia", you play a young boy named Cless, who lives together with his parents in a quiet village. It was a day like all the others when Cless decided to go hunting with his best friend Chester. Chasing a wild boar, Cless discovered a strange talking tree in the forest who was pleading him for help. But as soon as it stopped speaking, the two friends heard the sound of an alarm. They returned to the village and found it burnt down, and all its inhabitants murdered. Before Cless' mother died in his arms, she told him this terrible massacre had something to do with the pendant she and her husband gave Cless for his birthday... what connection could there be? Cless decides to visit his uncle who lives in another town, but he doesn't realize his journey will take him to much more remote places than that!

"Tales of Phantasia" presents a unique combat system: The battles have a lot in common with fighting games: you fight on a platform that slowly scrolls forward and have to attack your enemy in real time. Other party members are controlled by AI. You can pause the game at any time and use magic, items, or choose an overall strategy for your allies.</desc>

	<name>Tenchi Muyou ! Game-Hen</name>
	<desc>Sasami is kidnapped by a mysterious little girl with magical powers, and Tenchi and his companions must travel to rescue her, battling monsters and other creatures on the way.

Tenchi Muyou! Game-Hen is a strategy game with RPG elements, based on the popular Japanese Tenchi Muyo! cartoon series. The game moves from battle to battle, with the plot being revealed through cutscenes between them. The player fights the computer on turns, controlling the individuals from a party of four. The party members are selected on a separate screen before each battle, and as the game progresses new characters become available.

During the skirmish, selecting the characters brings up a menu with three command options: move, attack or end turn. A fourth transform option becomes available later, after they reach a higher level. When moving or attacking, glowing tiles on the ground show the maximum range of the action. Performing either one costs action points, shown as eight regenerating green dots on the status window, alongside basic statistics like health, defense and attack levels. Characters level up automatically while on the battlefield, increasing their abilities and receiving more powerful attacks. Health powers are also accessed through the attack menu, recovering lost points to an ailing comrade within their range. Characters can transform to a more powerful version when they have the ability to do so, and all the eight green dots are still available. The transformed unit has more powerful attacks and a wider range of movement.

After the battle, a map screen appears where the player can save the game, and choose the next battle from one of the available paths. It is possible to revisit battlegrounds, to level up before tackling stronger enemies.

	<name>Torneko no Daibouken - Fushigi no Dungeon</name>
	<desc>Torneko (aka Taloon) from Dragon Quest IV was a merchant and treasure hunter who always dreamed of owning his own shop. Having defeating the evil along with other heroes, he returned to Endor to work peacefully. Some time has passed and after growing successful in this town, Torneko grew anxious. Hearing rumors one day about a "Mysterious Dungeon", Torneko meets with the king to ask permission to set up a new shop, closer to this Mysterious Dungeon. By exploring this cavern and returning safely with the prizes, Torneko hopes to become the most successful merchant in the world.

Torneko No Daibouken is a overhead view game similar to Hack, what might be called a "dungeon crawl". Torneko must venture into the mysterious dungeon gathering treasure. He may equip any weapons and shields he finds there, as well as gather up items such as spell scrolls, staffs and herbs with a variety of effect. A variety of enemies, familiar to the Dragon Quest series, await him. If Torneko successfully exits the dungeon, he is able to sell any of the items he has collected. This money then goes to improve the quality of his shop and living quarters. As the game progresses, Torneko is able to store special items in the vault, which he is then able to bring with him on subsequent trips to the dungeon.</desc>

	<name>Treasure Hunter G</name>
	<desc>Brothers Red and Blue G. decide to leave their idyllic village in search of their long lost father, who left the kids years ago to go treasure hunting. Unfortunately, as soon as they begin their quest, they become entangled with a mysterious girl on the run from evil monsters who holds the key to the resurrection of a great demon. Now its up to the brothers to save the world if they ever want to find their father.

Treasure Hunter G is a top-down RPG in which you control your party of four characters as they explore the fantasy/sci-fi game world in search for quests and grinding their stats while the plot advances. The game is divided in a world-map screen, a top-down "town" mode and a turn-based fight mode in which the characters are taken to generic tiled top-down arenas in which they select each character and move or attack depending on their action points.

Enemies can be seen on the map instead of jumping at you at random intervals, and you can freely decide whether to engage them or simply circle them around. The game uses a combination of hand-drawn sprites and CGI pre-rendered one (mostly for the main characters) with a distinct cute or Super Deformed design (as usual for most console RPGs).</desc>

	<desc>Uchu no Kishi: Tekkaman Blade's is based on the anime Tekkaman Blade, also known as Teknoman. The game's levels are a mix of scrolling shooter and fighting game. The first part of every level is a scrolling shooter where Tekkaman Blade must survive several waves of Radam before killing two stronger boss-like Radam and meeting another Tekkaman. In scrolling shooter levels Blade can either toss his spear to defeat enemies at range or quickly slash with it to destroy bullets and enemies. One enemy type will drop different colored System Box powerups: green restores health, red destroys all enemies onscreen (except bosses), and blue turns Blade invulnerable and able to destroy all enemies upon contact (including bosses).

The end of every level is a one on one fight with an enemy Tekkaman. Each Tekkaman starts with a weapon, but the weapon will be lost if they take too much damage, forcing them to use punches and kicks. This mode can also be played in 2-player mode, where each player selects their Tekkaman.</desc>

The game's specialty is the detailed physics system that allows Kawase to perform various tricks using the elastic and length variable rope to move around the levels. There are almost 50 fields (levels) but most have multiple exits that allow you to play through the game on different paths without playing every single field in order. You can also record a good game and save it to watch it again at a later time.</desc>

	<path>./Wonder Project J - Kikai no Shounen Pino (Japan) (Translated En).sfc</path>
	<name>Wonder project J</name>
	<desc>There was once a great scientist and inventor named Gepetto, who lived on an island farm together with his creations, his robotic helper, the pixie Tinker, and his pet animals. His greatest creation was an artificial boy named Pino. No, he was not carved from wood, but looked just like a real boy - only he could turn his head 360 degrees. But Gepetto was arrested for an unknown reason. The boy Pino looks like a real boy, but he was completed just a few moments ago, and he knows absolutely nothing. All he can do is wander aimlessly, poking objects and turning his head. It is up to you, the player, to make Pino a real man!

In this simulation/role-playing game, you must use the robotic pixie Tinker to educate Pino. You can move Tinker around, examining objects and collecting them in an adventure-like fashion. Pino will automatically follow you to the direction you are facing, but will continue walking until you stop him. He will also pick objects and make his own "experiments" with them. Your goal is to train PIno in various disciplines. His stats can be raised in a RPG style: reading books increases his intelligence, throwing a ball increases his dexterity, and so on. By praising or scolding Pino you will gradually make him understand what should be done and what not.

To play, you move the randomly placed cookies into rows and columns of cookies with similar patterns. When you successfully assemble a row or column of the same cookies, the line will disappear, and you can begin on a new row or column. The "Yoshi" cookie is very special in both the 1-player and the 2-player game. Since the Yoshi Cookie is the key to both games, you must use it wisely.</desc>

	<desc>After having defeated the ultimate evil in his previous adventure, the great hero Adol stands on a sea shore, thinking about the fate of the once peaceful Utopian land of Ys, while the wind is blowing through his red hair. Suddenly, Adol notices a bottle, thrown onto the shore. It contains a letter, written in a foreign language, in which an unknown person asks Adol to come to his land and save it from a mysterious evil. Adol decides to accept the offer, and thus his adventure begins again...

Ys IV: Mask of the Sun is an action RPG with a combat system like the earlier Ys games. An enemy should be rammed from the sides in order to hurt him. If performed incorrectly, the player will get hurt himself. It's also possible to use magic and position oneself strategically in battle so that the enemy won't be able to inflict any damage.

	<desc>YuYu Hakusho is a Super Famicom game based on the horror-themed manga and anime about a belligerent young man who dies unexpectedly from being hit by a car and is revived as a "spirit detective" by the rulers of the afterlife, and it becomes his job to investigate ghostly matters in the mortal world. The game is a series of set-piece battles where two opponents build up gauges using the D-pad and one of the face buttons: each combination leads to a separate attack and requires a different amount of build-up. The player can go through the story mode, which recounts events from the manga, or they can play a "free" mode against opponents of their choice.</desc>

The biggest addition however is the inclusion of a 4-player royal rumble mode and the ability to perform team-up moves in the tag matches.

The game casts you as a wrestler of your choice in the official Zen Nippon Pro Wrestling league and pits you against the other featured wrestlers in grappling matches. As in the original you get to pick between several game modes including: Tournament, Championship (single or tag) Vs, Team (with the new 4-player variant) and Training.</desc>

	<desc>Zero4 Champ RR is a 1994 racing video game developed by Media Rings for the Super Famicom, about an 18-year-old race car driver who must chase his dreams of drag racing after being turned down for university (and becoming a r?nin due to his joblessness status).

Because the game takes place in the "near future" and it was released in the mid-1990s, the game itself is referring the story of the game to the first decade of the 21st century.

This game received a sequel in the form of Zero4 Champ RR-Z.</desc>

	<path>./Acrobat Mission (Japan).fig</path>
	<name>Acrobat Mission</name>
	<desc>Years ago humanity abandoned the over-polluted Earth to make a new home on Mars. Now, without warning, a mechanical moon has appeared in the skies over Mars, and is raining down destruction on the colonies. A plan is hastily put into action to destroy the moon and its armada of space-craft. Due to the impossible task of surviving a direct assault, the mission is code-named Acrobat Mission.

Your spaceship in Acrobat Mission is capable of firing a single straight ahead shot. By picking up a Wide upgrade, more shots are added that fly off at an angle, and the shot can be charged up to unleash a continuous short range cone of energy. Picking up a Hurricane upgrade will cause bullets to circle you defensively before shooting forward, and charging will store a full round of bullets up to be fired straight ahead all at once. Up to two bombs can be held at once, and if an enemy bullet hits a bomb it will detonate, saving your ship from damage. If your ship is hit, however, then you will have a few seconds to ram it into whatever shot you and take them down with you. Unlike most scrolling shooter games contact with an enemy ship will not kill you, but they can still push you into the path of bullets.

Play takes place over five levels, first of your launch on Mars, then the approach to the moon, and finally infiltrating the base to destroy its core. Each level ends with a unique boss except stage 4, which ends with 3 bosses.</desc>

	<desc>Past and future are connected in a way mortals do not understand...  A star was glowing up in the sky, and the demon god Alcahest appeared, bringing chaos and destruction to the world. A single swordsman stood in defiance. The four powers that protect the world, the Guardians, gave him their power, and with it the swordsman slew the demon and restored peace in the world. 

Thousand years have passed. And a new battle is already on the way. A cruel emperor leads his troops towards conquest. The kingdom of Panakeia is defending itself with the aid of its knights. Once again, the ominous star shines in the sky, indicating the demon's revival. With the help of Alcahest's power, the evil emperor wants to conquer the world. But the new generation also brings the new hero - the brave swordsman Alen. Aided by the Guardians, Alen must stop the Empire's evil plans and to destroy Alcahest once again.

This is an action game with RPG elements. You wander around slaying enemies in real time combat, gathering treasure on the way, and occasionally participating in boss battles. When you gather enough experience from fighting, you gain extra hit points. You can also upgrade your weapons. On the way you'll meet some characters who will join your party for short time, and you'll be able to use their special attacks and magic.</desc>

	<desc>In a future where fossil fuels are limited, major countries and forces of the world are at war with one another over territory. Alliances are made, forming two major sides: The Axis and The Federation.  The elite units in these wars are Assault Suits, man-piloted combat mechs called Assault Suits.  Jake is one such pilot, drafted into the Pacific States' Marine Corp under the Federation. During his training, the war has grown substantially and upon being assigned to a platoon, he is immediately thrown into combat.

Cybernator is a side scrolling mech combat game and platform game. The player controls Jake as he moves his assault suit left and right on the battlefield. The assault suit can jump and use a jetpack for a short time to increase altitude. The assault suit begins with a Shot machine gun weapon that spreads out fire in front, and a Punch weapon for close melee. Additional weapons can be found during the course of the game and existing weapons improved by the gathering of "P" power-ups, left by defeated enemy. Each level contains a variety of enemies and an end boss which must be destroyed to reach the next level. Some levels take place as horizontally scrolling shooters, in which the Assault suit can move up, down, left and right on the screen... but is constantly advancing towards new threats.</desc>

	<desc>The kingdom of Kahna is in great danger. The evil Emperor Sauzer, obsessed by his world domination ideas, is preparing to invade the kingdom. The king sends his best troops of knights and wizards to face the enemy, but in vain - the kingdom is conquered by Sauzer, the king is murdered, and his lovely daughter is kidnapped. You were brave, Leader of the Dragon Squad, but now you will have to become strong. Remember the promise you gave the princess long time ago: always to be at her side. Supported by his friends and by his faithful dragons, you must now free the princess and the kingdom from the enemy's hands. If only the strongest of the dragons, Bahamut, could be awakened...

Bahamut Lagoon, created by the company which gave us the Final Fantasy games, is a mixture of turn-based strategy and RPG. Control several parties of four characters each, and command different dragons at once. The battles start on a top-down screen typical for strategy games, but often switch to a dynamic "platform" view, such as used in early console RPGs. You also can influence the game by other strategic activities, such as, for example, setting a whole forest on fire, to prevent enemies to come through it.</desc>

	<name>Bakutou Dochers</name>
	<desc>Bakutou Dodgers is a Japan-only action game for up to four players. It superficially resembles Hudson's Bomberman series, with its top-down grid stages and chaotic gameplay, but rather than leaving bombs and waiting for them to explode, the player can shoot energy at blocks and each other.

The goal is to sneak up behind the opponent and shoot them before they can reciprocate. Various power-ups may appear after destructible blocks are removed, which can give the player an edge or, in the case of the ? icon, a possible random negative effect like reversed controls. There are also wandering monsters that can cause damage to anyone they come in contact with. Every combatant has a health bar which depletes at a rate dependent on the attacks they are getting hit by.

The single-player mode involves fighting through various worlds and removing all enemy combatants from the field to progress.</desc>

	<desc>In this game, you're either in the foreground or the background, and your opponent is always on the opposite end of the screen. To fight whoever flies thar yonder in the distance, you send out projectiles, in our case fireballs. These behave differently depending on which of the four main buttons you press: if you press the A button, they fly in a curve towards the upper right part of the screen, if you push the Y button, they go left and down and so on and so forth. Sadly, they move so slowly your opponent has a good three seconds to get out of the way, and in so weird curves that aiming is impossible. Also, the screen constantly twists in all directions.</desc>

	<name>Battle Jockey</name>
	<desc>Battle Jockey is a racing game for up to four players that was developed by Nova and published by Virgin Interactive exclusively in Japan for the Super Famicom.It features horseracing, a far more popular pastime in Japan than elsewhere, and presents three separate modes: the first is the standard single-player story mode, in which the player takes a horse and jockey through training and races; the second is a battle mode which pits up to four players against each other in races that have far more power-ups and other unusual additions to the game's courses; and the third is a passive gambling mode in which the player puts money down on horses depending on their odds of winning and subsequent payouts and then watches the race play out with CPU players.The standard mode involves carefully managing the horse's stamina: being too aggressive will cause it to rear up in protest. Falling behind or running into a hedge or jump will cause the horse to lose stamina, and losing all stamina causes it to collapse briefly. The player needs to keep a steady pace, steer carefully around corners, jump at the right times and use the boost sparingly in order to win. In the battle mode stamina is less of a concern and the game more resembles RC Pro-Am: the players have to simply follow the course and avoid the dangers as they show up.</desc>

	<path>./Bishoujo Senshi Sailor Moon - Another Story (Japan) (Translated En).fig</path>
	<name>Sailor Moon : Another Story</name>
	<desc>The game is based on the Japanese manga and animé series Bishoujo Senshi: Sailor Moon - "Bishoujo Senshi" roughly meaning "Pretty Young Girl Warrior". It is set in the 30th century, in a futuristic city Crystal Tokyo. In this city lives a totally ordinary (at first) fourteen-year old girl Usagi. When she meets a magical cat named Luna, she finds out that she is in fact a princess sent to the future in order to fight the minions of Darkness. She discovers within herself the power to transform into the hero of darkness, Sailor Moon, meets other warriors who help her on her quest, and fights the evil Queen Beryl, hostile aliens, and other foes.

The events of this game take place shortly after Bishoujo Senshi Sailor Moon S, the fourth volume of the long-running series. A global peace is established in the universe, but lately suspicious things are happening. A strange meteorite is seen approaching the Earth. Street gangs and spies who work for a mysterious person called Apsu are seen in Crystal Tokyo. And the Mystic Silver Crystal, the Ginzuishou, which protects the city, is shaking! Usagi and her friends must now investigate the strange events and face the forces of Darkness once again.

The game is a console-style RPG in Final Fantasy style (battles with your party to the right and the enemies to the left), with a battle system somewhat similar to that of Chrono Trigger: you must form a party out of several available characters, make them participate in battles together, and learn powerful combo attacks.

	<desc>The game is based on the animé series Sailor Moon. The main character of the series is Tsukino Usagi, a 14-year-old schoolgirl who unexpectedly gets involved in an epic adventure. Luna, a magical talking cat, contacts her and tells her she is in fact a Sailor Moon, one of the legendary Pretty Fighters - girls who fight the forces of darkness and protect the Kingdom of Moon. 

The game is based on the events of the animé that follow the victory of Usagi and her friends over the Queen Beryl. Peace has returned to the Moon Kingdom. But suddenly, a little girl named Chibiusa arrives from the future and says the future kingdom is threatened by the forces of the evil Prince Diamond. Looks like you are the only ones who can defeat him, and save the future Sailor Moon, Chibiusa's mother.

This is a beat-'em up game. You can play as either Usagi or any of her girlfriends, including Chibiusa. You move on a platform and fight the enemies by punching, kicking, and throwing them, and by using special abilities unique to each character. You can advance only after you have cleared an area from enemies.

	<name>Sailor Moon S : Kondo wa Puzzle de Oshioki yo</name>
	<desc>Bishoujo Senshi Sailor Moon S: Kondoha Puzzle de Oshiokiyo is a falling block competitive puzzle game. Players begin by choosing from a selection of Sailor Moon licensed characters, each with a unique special attack. The player is presented with a board filled with colored blocks in three colors: red, blue and green. The goal is to remove all the blocks from play. Clicking on a block that touches several adjacent blocks of the same color will remove them all from play. As each player successfully clears blocks, they drop "black blocks" on their opponent as well as increase their power bar. Black blocks cannot be removed by normal means and disappear only when large ammounts of blocks are removed adjacent to them. As the power bar charges, players can unleash their special ability, often an attack on the other player.

This puzzle game is based on the "S" series of Sailor Moon and includes characters from there: Sailor Moon, Sailor Mars, Sailor Venus, Sailor Mercury, Sailor Jupiter, Chibiusa, Tuxedo Mask, Sailor Uranus, Sailor Neptune and Sailor Pluto.

	<name>Sailor Moon S : Kurukkurin</name>
	<desc>Bishoujo Senshi Sailor Moon S: Kurukkurin is a competitive puzzle game featuring Sailor Moon licensed characters. Upon choosing a character (each with unique "special moves"), the player competes against an opponent. Each player controls a grid of 10x6 sections (represented by hearts) initially made up of clear hearts. The player moves their cursor over the clear hearts to turn them into one of four colors: red, yellow, blue and green. Sometimes "treasures" will show up on the board. When several hearts of the same color are adjacent to one another, the player can clear them... which pushes all the hearts (and treasures) down towards the bottom. The goal is to be the player with the most treasures to end the round.

Sailor Moon characters featured are primarily from the "S" Series and includes: Sailor Moon, Sailor Mars, Sailor Mercury, Sailor Venus, Sailor Jupiter, Chibius, Tuxedo Mask, Sailor Neptune, Sailor Uranus and Sailor Pluto.

	<name>Brandish 2 : The Planet Buster</name>
	<desc>The Planet Buster continues the story that was told in the first Brandish game, and depicts the events that happened three years after the evil demonic king was defeated in his lost kingdom, sunken deep underground. You take control of a young warrior named Ares, who wields a magical weapon, a powerful sword called the Planet Buster. One day, while traveling through a desert, Ares is captured by a warlock named Karl, who is after the powers hidden within the magical sword. Suspecting Ares might have some valuable information, Karl doesn't execute him, but takes away the Planet Buster and throws Ares into his underground prison. Now your primary goal is to guide Ares out of the huge prison full of various dangers, and to get your mighty weapon back.

The game is an action RPG with a heavy emphasis on dungeon crawling. You guide Ares through rotating dungeons, fighting enemies in real-time combat, casting spells, and solving an occasional puzzle. You have the ability to jump forwards and to attack inanimate objects such as doors to cause damage and to break the object.

	<name>Captain Tsubasa J</name>
	<desc>A 1995 Japan-exclusive Captain Tsubasa video game developed and published by Bandai and was the final Captain Tsubasa game for the Super Famicom.
This game suffered lots of changes from previous games made by Tecmo, this time you will be playing in a real soccer field and in real time, which means that you need to press certain keys even without having the chance of stopping the time (like in previous games), When a certain player is confronted with a one that he considers his rival (like Misugi and Schneider or Tsubasa and *any other player*, for example) they will have a fight, which is mainly a button smashing sequence. The same goes for the sequence in which a goalkeeper tries to stop any of the special shots.
This game has almost the same story as the Captain Tsubasa J anime, except that this one will finish with a special match against an extra team. So, you'll play across various chapters, playing with Aoi Shingo in Italy or controlling the mythic Ozora Tsubasa in his match against the brazillian prodigy, Carlos Santana (nope, he isn't the singer). You'll also play with Japan national team against the same opponents as they did in the anime version..</desc>

The game would then be available for sale shortly before or after the competition, which helped raise its profile.</desc>

	<desc>CB Chara Wars, sometimes written with the subtitle Ushinawareta Gag, is an RPG that features a crossover of sorts of Go Nagai's various manga franchises. These include Devilman and Mazinger Z, among others. The "CB" in the title refers to the term "chibi", which depicts characters as smaller and cuter than usual. In that sense, it is similar to the term SD (super deformation) found in several Super Famicokm Gundam game titles.CB Chara Wars began as an original video animation which first aired in 1991. A manga adaptation followed the following year, as did this game. Banpresto published the game in Japan, a company known for creating games with anime crossovers such as the Super Robot Taisen/Wars series.</desc>

	<name>Chinhai</name>
	<desc>Chinhai is a puzzle game for the Super Famicom and a variant on Mahjong Solitaire, or Shanghai. Instead of pairing and removing any two tiles that match as long as one of their sides is clear, as is the case in Shanghai, the rules of Chinhai require that the two tiles can only be removed if it's possible to draw a line between the two that doesn't make a 90 degree turn more than twice. Two tiles on opposite sides of the board, for instance, can't be paired because it would take three 90 degree turns to draw a line between them. To account for this added difficulty, the game lacks the "stacks" of tiles that frequently appear in Shanghai, instead presenting a flat board of tiles.Chinhai is named for the municipality of Chinhai in China, maintaining the theme of naming mahjong solitaire variants after territories in China. Chinhai has long since been renamed Zhenhai, which is situated in the Ningpo Prefecture and now part of a much larger city. This mahjong solitaire variant is perhaps best known as Sichuan or Shisenshou, also named for a province in China.</desc>

	<desc>The Cho Aniki series makes it's debut on the SNES with all of it's homo-erotic, pseudo humorous, bizarre, sweaty bodybuilding charm, but with one major gameplay change. Instead of being another side-scrolling shooter, Bakuretsu Rantouden is actually a one-on-one 2D fighter a la Street Fighter in which the most recognizable characters from the Cho Aniki series (yes the speedo wearing bodybuilders included) fight each other for ultimate supremacy using special attacks and moves.

An interesting feature is that the game honors it's shooter roots, therefore instead of being restricted to walking backwards and forwards in the 2D plane and jumping around as in other fighting games, in this game all the characters can fly meaning the fights actually occur in mid-air allowing the players to dash all over the screen. Includes single player and 2-player vs modes.

	<desc>?In this sidescrolling action-platformer, Bonk is once again trying to save his world from the evil clutches of the reptilian king, who once more is threatening the prehistoric era.  Boy, you'd think that after being defeated four times prior that he would take a hint.  This time, you also get to face his five best soldiers, who will try to stop you in your tracks.  Bonk controls rather smoothly, and he is really fun to control.  To those of you that are not familiar with the series, Bonk is a caveman who attacks his enemies with his noggin; after jumping down, from below, while swimming, and while in the air.  He can even bounce off walls with his head, skip on the water like a stone if his head is facing down, climb certain walls with his teeth, scale up waterfalls, flip in the air (so long as the attack button is repeatedly being tapped), and so forth.  As is the case with the series, you start with a regular amount of health, but if you find a translucent heart icon, you'll increase your capacity.  What's neat is how collecting the food not only scores you some points but how it also replenishes a little bit of your health, too.  This time Bonk can also run if you hold down the A button, and the X button is used if you have a special ability on you.  If you find a power-up, whether it be piece of meat, or a different icon, then you will be given a power-up ability that will be taken out the moment you're hit once (damn).  Among the power-ups are the one where the fire will be spreading if Bonk hits his head on the ground (you know, the one where he looks freaky), one where Bonk turns into a bird and gains the ability to fly, one where Bonk becomes tiny and can make platforms made out of Japanese characters, and there is one where Bonk has the ability to double-jump as a girl.  Yes, Bonk becomes a girl if he eats the pink-colored meat.  I'm dead serious.</desc>

	<desc>The legend of the Valkyrie pilots is not yet over. Hikaru, Max, and Millia take flight to defend the earth from Zentraedi, robots, more robots, and giant space crab-bees. Now is the time to scramble Valkyrie again. 

When starting a game or continuing the player picks from either Hikaru, Max, or Millia. Each flies a custom Valkyrie with its own set weapon load-out. A Valkyrie changes its weapon and movement speed by switching between its three forms: Fighter, Gerwalk, and Battroid. Typically the Valkyrie weapon shoots straight and quickly, the Gerwalk weapon shoots around or through obstacles, and the Battroid weapon does higher damage in exchange for reduced firing rate. Each weapon can be upgraded up to twice by picking up power up items dropped by special enemy ships, but one level of power up will be lost any time the Valkyrie is shot. If a Valkyrie's entire life bar is depleted then the full stage must be repeated, provided the player still has enough continues.

In a nod to Galaga the player is able to capture some enemy craft to increase their firepower. If the player does not shoot any weapons for a few seconds a field of electricity will cover the Valkyrie. Touching some enemy ships will then cause their targeting to be shorted out and make them friendly to the player, following along and shooting or ramming onscreen enemies.

	<name>Chou Mahou Tairiku Wozz </name>
	<desc>The magic world of Wozz, populated by magicians, alchemists, and other kinds of people - including simple town and village inhabitants - was a seemingly peaceful place, until one day, a poisonous rain started turning its inhabitants into monsters. The chief wizard realizes that the demon Balaam is trying to link the world of Wozz with the world of humans. Only a human hero can stop Balaam, and the wizard's teleporting magic brings... three young humans: the Japanese girl Reona Kitazato, and two boys: the American Shot Phoenix and the Chinese Chun Chingtao. Will those youngsters be able to stop Balaam?

The game is a traditional console-style RPG similar to Breath of Fire: turn-based battles are viewed from an isometric perspective. You control all three characters as a party, but in the beginning of the game you choose one of them as the main character, and therefore will see the game from his/her perspective. In case the characters split up, you'll be able to control only the one you chose.

	<desc>Cosmo Gang: The Puzzle is a puzzle game from Namco and the second game to feature their Cosmo Gang characters. The Cosmo Gang were originally attached to a group of redemption games (like pachinko or claw machines) from Namco, but would eventually star in two Arcade games: Cosmo Gang: The Video, a Galaga clone, and Cosmo Gang: The Puzzle.

This game would become the basis of Namco's more well-known puzzle game Pac-Attack, featuring Pac-Man. As with Pac-Attack, the idea is to stack up a lot of the animated face icons (members of the Cosmo Gang) in an unbroken chain and then drop a bomb (shaped like an arrow) that goes down the chain and eliminates them all at once.</desc>

Galivan and company don't have time to find items or level up weapons as in Galivan's previous outing; this is a no holds barred slugfest. Three characters are playable, each with varying stats but basically the same moveset. Each character has a standard straight ahead punch or kick, a sweeping kick, an uppercut, and a ranged attack that must be charged up. At the start of the game and the end of every level the player can add stat points to their character to increase their HP, defense, jump height, and strength of normal and special attacks.

A 2 player versus mode is included as well. Both players can choose from the three main characters, and the second player can additionally choose from one of the four normal enemy types.</desc>

	<name>Crayon Shin Chan</name>
	<desc>Five-year-old Shinnosuke Nohara is the epitome of noisy children: loud and inappropriate, infuriating to his parents, and hilarious to onlookers. Shin-chan is always getting in trouble with his parents and saying bizarre or offensive things to everyone he meets. Every so often, though, he'll try to do what his mom wants him to, but more often than not, he'll misunderstand and simply confound his parents further.

Arashi o Yobu Enji ("A Kindergartner Called Tempest") is one of many games based on the manga and anime created by Yoshito Usui. In four stages, each made up of five areas, Shin-chan must explore his neighborhood looking for a specific object. He can enter houses to ask people for information, but will often end up simply insulting them. He must also avoid or knock over the other children in the neighborhood, and has various ability cards that he can use to assist him, which might give him a water pistol or refill his health. After finding what he's looking for, Shin-chan will move on to the next area.

Also included is a minigame mode with eight different minigames, such as a bubble-blowing contest, a three-legged race, and a desperate search for clothing before school. The entire game, including the minigames, is filled with dialogue containing the same humor as the source material.

The player, as the mischievous kindergartner Shin-chan, must rescue his favorite super hero Action Kamen ("Action Mask") from his prison before Action Kamen's supervillain nemesis Haiguremaou can take over both Action Kamen's and Shin-chan's worlds. Many of the bosses are transformed versions of Shin-chan's friends and family.

The game is a standard side-scrolling 2D platformer - common with licensed games - though it is notable for letting players decide which order they want to tackle stages, not to mention the franchise's penchant for weird/gross-out humor.</desc>

	<desc>There was once a prosperous kingdom, a peaceful kingdom, ruled by a wise old king, where all peopled lived happily together, protected by the power of a magical crystal. But one day, several dark clouds appeared over the kingdom and poured down a devastating rain. And then one of the clouds turned into a demon, and, reaching its hands to the treasure room in the palace, took the crystal away. The demon lord, still in a form of a menacing dark cloud, started spawning monsters and sending them to attack the now helpless kingdom. The king called to the heavens for help. Eight magical weapons fell on the ground, and eight warriors rose to protect their country. Your task now is to cleanse the land of the monsters and to defeat the evil demon lord.

"Crystal Beans" is an action RPG based on fighting and dungeon crawling. You can play as either of the eight initial character classes: Fighter, Warrior, Bow-man, Wizard, Priest, Kage (a kind of a ninja), Monk, or Witch. In addition, there are four secret classes you discover during your journey. Each class has its own strength and weaknesses, and two unique attack types.</desc>

	<desc>Cu-On-Pa SFC is the Super Famicom version of Cu-On-Pa.Cu-On-Pa is an original puzzle game that was developed by a little-known group called Onesong Partners. This group originally released an obscure game similar to this but with a wider audience in mind, various enhancements and alternate modes for PCs called "Endorfun" in 1995 in the U.S and Europe.Japanese developers seemed to like the concept and got permission to make something like it based on the original principals of Endorfun for the obscure Satellaview (or BS-X) and then later as a standalone release for the Super Famicom, where the game was called BS Cu-On-Pa and Cu-On-Pa, respectively. It would also get released later for Playstation.Published by T&amp;E Soft for the SFC late in 1996, Cu-On-Pa was also fan-translated sometime later for the emulation community, though the game comes with a rather straightforward tutorial and the game is very easy to understand, but difficult to master. This game is difficult to describe and in a league of its own.You play as a three-dimensional cube that must destroy all the "Life Panels" on a level. To do so, you have to rotate your cube and roll over the colored squares on the transparent field. Panels come in a variety of colors and the main way to elimate them is by having the color on the top of the cube match the color of the tile beneath you.The other way is for more skilled players and comes in the form of "Lightning Panels", which are generated when you destroy panels other than Life Panels. Destroy enough of them and you'll have lots of them. Then go and destroy a life panel! What will happen is, all lightning panels will explode that match the color of the life panel you rolled over. Moreover, the explosion spreads and detonates other tiles in the vicinity, which can spread and create a chain reaction. It's up to you how you wish to rack up points, either by time, chains, or both.Ken Kojima was the music composer.</desc>

	<name>Cyber Knight</name>
	<desc>In the 24th century, mankind has gone into space. The crew of the starship Swordfish are in an engagement with space pirates when the battle takes a turn for the worse. In desperation, the crew activate their jump drive without a destination... and end up flung across the galaxy to the galactic core. The Swordfish however is badly damaged with many casualties including the captain. Only 26 of the crew survive, and of them only 6 are qualified for combat: The commander, two soldiers, a mechanic and a doctor and six giant "Module" mechanized suits available for them. These survivors locate planet Farworld, apparently colonized by humans. There they discover the colony is under attack by a relentless mechanical aliens dubbed "Berserkers". The crew of the swordfish must fight back against the Berserkers and explore the galaxy for some means to return home.

Cyber Knight is an RPG with a science-fiction theme of being lost in an alien galaxy. The game takes place in a top-down view for movement on planets and areas, a side-view for combat sequences and a first person menu system when aboard the Swordfish starship. The Swordfish can travel between stars, scanning worlds for information. If the ship is able to land on a planet, three crew members piloting three Modules (giant robots) can be selected to debark and explore the planet. Many planets will have towns or people living on them which can be talked to in order to uncover information. Different quests are assigned in order to find the items necessary to progress. There is no system of currency or buying items. Instead, many defeated Berserkers leave behind "NeoParts", which can be brought back to the Swordfish's lab. Analysis of these Neo parts unlocks enhances statistics (endurance, agility, accuracy, etc) for the Modules and new weapons for them to carry. The six modules are unique in statistics, and also the six pilots each carry different skills.

Combat takes place in turn-based combat on a 6x6 squares field. Seen from the side view, the three modules can be positioned in relation to enemies in order to attack, using a variety of melee and long-ranged weaponry. Ammunition is unlimited, but each module also carries a number of "options" that are consumable attacks. Each Module has two sets of hitpoints: one for the pilot and one for the module itself. If either one of these reaches zero, the module is destroyed. In order to heal, the party carries 10 each of repair kits and first aid kits, which must when not in combat. These kits, as well as options and defeated pilots or modules can be restored by returning to the Swordfish.</desc>

	<desc>Following the events of the first Cyber Knight in the 24th century, the crew of the Swordfish have returned to Earth after defeating the mechanical "Berzerkers" far across space. However during their time away, the Earth Federation has been taken over by the ambitious General Forrest, who seeks to wage war on the independent systems and conquer them. Recognizing the potential weapons that could be made from the Berzerker science data, Forrest impounds the Swordfish and jails it's crew. The Berzerker data is used to create "Overtech" and bring to life "Metalliforms", self-replicating war machines. The Swordfish crew manages to escape, thanks to a mysterious agent "CJ", and are recruited into the resistance against the Earth Federation. Given a new spaceship, the Galvodirge, they must travel the galaxy to different human civilizations and devise a plan to stop Earth's attack.

Cyber Knight II is an RPG with science-fiction themes. As in the first game, much of the game takes place in a top-down view for movement on planets and areas, a side-view for combat sequences and a first person menu system when aboard the Galvodirge starship. The Galvodirge can travel between stars, scanning worlds for information. If the ship is able to land on a planet, the crew can debark either on foot or using combat modules (mechs). Some areas are only accessible using modules and others (such as towns) do not allow the use of these war machines. Many planets will have towns or people living on them which can be talked to in order to uncover information. Different quests are assigned in order to find the items necessary to progress. There is no system of currency or buying items. Instead, many defeated enemies leave behind "NeoParts", which can be brought back to the Swordfish's lab. Analysis of these Neo parts unlocks enhances statistics (endurance, agility, accuracy, etc) for the Modules and new weapons for them to carry. 

The crew are divided into a three person "combat team" and a three person "support team". If modules are used, they can be assigned from the ship's hanger. Unlike the first game, modules only perform a combat or a support role, and each is unique in statistics and the type of weaponry it can carry. When combat occurs on the main map, the support team will often deliver the first strike by firing missiles into the enemies. When searching facilities, caves or other locations, the support team is not available. Following either case, the combat team engages the enemy in turn-based combat on a 6x6 squares field. Seen from the side view, the three modules can be positioned in relation to enemies in order to attack, using a variety of melee and long-ranged weaponry. Ammunition is unlimited, but each module also carries a number of "options" that are consumable attacks. Each Module has two sets of hitpoints: one for the pilot and one for the module itself. If either one of these reaches zero, the module is destroyed. In order to heal, the party carries 10 each of repair kits and first aid kits, which must when not in combat. These kits, as well as options and defeated pilots or modules can be restored by returning to the Galvodirge.</desc>

	<name>Cyborg 009</name>
	<desc>Nine young people were turned into cyborgs by a company trying to take over the world. They have defeated this company and are now using their super powers to protect the world.

Based on the manga/anime by the same name, Cyborg 009 is a side-scrolling platformer in which the player takes control of 8 different cyborgs, using their special abilities to complete several missions. 

Their special abilities are as follows:
002 can fly and hover in the air; 003 can see in the dark; 004 can fire bullets from his fingers and rockets from his knees; 005 can break rocks with his fists; 006 can blow fire that also melts rocks; 007 can take on different shapes including those of enemies; 008 can swim underwater for extended periods of time; 009 can move at very high speeds. (001 is a baby and can't be taken on missions). Using these special abilities consumes SP that slowly regenerate. 

In addition to their special abilities, the cyborgs also have four attributes that govern their attack and defensive powers, their amount of SP and SP regeneration speed. 

Before every mission, one cyborg is assigned leader and two more can be selected by the player. Only one cyborg can be controlled at a time, but it is possible to switch between cyborgs at any time. All cyborgs share the same HP and SP-bar. Throughout the levels, experience points can be collected and used to increase a cyborg's attributes after a completed mission.</desc>

	<desc>Six months after the DC War (as chronicled in Super Robot Wars 2), the DC seems to be regaining their former combat strength thanks to the Zabi family. In response, the United Nations has decided to reorganize itself into the Earth Federation.

The heroes of the last war are formed into a unit known as Londo Bell; however, the Earth Federation distrusts them due to their immense power, and provides them with as few resources as they can...</desc>

	<name>Dark Half</name>
	<desc>Through the Light came the Darkness, and through the Darkness came the Light. They were inseparable in the beginning, and gave birth to each other. Rukyu appeared before all the other creatures, the great demon of darkness, later to be known as the Satan. The divine hero-god Roda went up to his dark realm to defeat him, but was struck down, and presumed dead. But the hero couldn't die so easily: he swore to defeat Rukyu once and for all. Meanwhile, Rukyu doesn't just stay in his realm, waiting for Roda: he goes out to the world as a death-bringing sorcerer, and he is out for Roda...

The game is quite different from most other RPGs, because it lets you play as both the "good" hero and the villain. The game is divided into chapters, and each chapter is played by either Roda or Rukyu. You switch the two heroes chapter-after-chapter, and lead them to their ultimate battle from two opposite sides. The entire game, including the battles, is viewed from an isometric perspective. The battles are random and turn-based, and the battle field is divided into squares you can position and move your characters on. Both Roda and Rukyu can have party members join them, and both attack mostly with magic. Rukyu uses a special energy called "Soul Power", while Roda cast one-time spells from scrolls he receives after battles.</desc>

	<name>Dark Law: The Meaning of Death</name>
	<desc>Three-hundred years ago, there were two kingdoms on the earth -Reyfore, ruled by the benevolent and mighty king Reynard, and Amugnon, ruled by king Daruk. The two kingdoms could have lived in peace, but pride took over king Daruk, he didn't respect the Goddess any more, and as a result his mind became obsessed by the idea of destruction. Daruk attacked Reyfore, and for decades war was embracing the two kingdoms, setting the Earth in flames. After a prolonged battle, king Reynard defeated king Daruk, and a reign of prosperity began once again.

But can evil be truly defeated? The hero of the game, a young adventurer, falls down from a cliff while taking a stroll near the ancient Sophia Temple. He is saved by an old man who lives with his daughter Refia in a small country house. But one day, a demonic-looking knight appears, accompanied by monsters, kills the old man, and kidnaps Refia. The old man recognized the knight - it was king Daruk! Now the hero must bring Refia back and defeat Daruk once and for all.

The game has a less linear structure than a standard console-style RPG: together with the main story there are many missions, or "scenarios", which are not obligatory to complete, but which occupy a large portion of the game. In the beginning of the game you create a party of four characters, the hero and his three companions. The battles are pre-determined and take place on the same screen as the gameworld itself. Your party and the enemies can move freely around the screen and attack with melee and ranged weapons, and their actions depend on the amount of action points they have. Navigation in town is menu-based.</desc>

	<desc>Dear Boys is a 1994 Super Famicom basketball game based on the manga of the same name. The game features both a story mode, which follows the plot of the manga, and an exhibition mode that allows the player to go straight into a match.

The game features a "dramatic" perspective that is also slightly turn-based, similar to the Captain Tsubasa games. A window demonstrates what is happening - a ball is passed, a shot is thrown, the tip-off - in dramatic comic book style that is reminiscent of the manga. While a player's athlete has the ball, the player can pull up a menu that allows them to choose to pass, shoot or look at the present characters stats - each character has their own strengths and weaknesses that the player should keep in mind.</desc>

	<desc>Dharma Doujou was originally released in the arcades by Metro3D in 1994 (picture on the left). While the original version provides the same gameplay as the Super Famicom version tested here, the game does have some noticeable differences. First of all, it has more enemies and features colorful backgrounds borrowed from traditional Japanese themes and myths (well, in the Korean version of the game, Metro3D apparently threw in a couple of bikini girls for good measure). Additionally, the arcade game only contains a story mode and there is no progress map or alternate game modes like in the Super Famicom port. But, most importantly, the gameplay is slightly different - the player has to move the character around the screen in order to hit a block with the mallet. The Super Famicon version, on the contrary, automatically aligns the player with the furthest most block, and this apparently minor difference makes the gameplay of the home conversion more fast-paced and enjoyable than the original.</desc>

	<name>Doraemon</name>
	<desc>The game is based on the animé series "Doraemon". Doraemon is a blue robotic cat who has the ability to enter dream world and to help the people who live there. In this game, Nobita, a bespectacled friend of Doraemon's, suddenly meets a little fairy. Long ago, humans and fairies lived together in peace, but since the humans started developing their technology, the fairies have no place any more. Nobita and Doraemon travel to the dream world to find out how can they help.

The game is divided into adventure and platform action modes. In adventure mode, you navigate Doraemon from a top-down view, talking to people and entering houses. When you have gathered enough information, a place on the map will be highlighted. If Doraemon (or other characters, later in the game) enters this place, a platform action section begins. In platform mode, Doraemon must overcome the obstacles and defeat enemies by jumping on them or by throwing magic dusk at them, in order to retrieve important items.

It is based on the manga "Doraemon", that tells the story of a Japanese boy named Nobita, who always gets bullied by stronger kids in the school. In the future, his grandson uses a time machine and send the cat-like robot Doraemon to protect Nobita. In this adventure, Nobita, Doraemon, and their friends travel to the Toys Land. Some evil toys are threatening this country, and it's up to our heroes to help its inhabitants.

The game is divided into adventure and platform action modes. In adventure mode, Doraemon walks around towns, talking to people and entering houses. Key locations lead to platform levels, which must be completed to advance the story. Platform levels include plenty of obstacles (pits, spikes, self-destructing platforms etc.), as well as various enemies who try to stop the heroes. You can choose one of the six available characters to play through the platform level. They all can jump and defeat enemies either by jumping on their heads or by using long-ranged weapons.

Nobita's future grandson constructs a cat-like blue robot named Doraemon, and sends him to the past to protect Nobita. In this game, a friend of Nobita's finds a fossil.

This is an action platform game with adventure elements. You can control Doraemon, Nobita, and other characters, traveling through platform levels, defeating or avoiding enemies. Each character has his own weapon and possesses a special ability (for example, Suneo can crawl through narrow spaces, etc.) which is often required to complete a stage. In present time, you travel through Nobita's town in top down view, talking to characters and entering houses. There is also a slight RPG element in the game, as you can buy items and upgrade your weapons.

	<desc>A young boy named Milon sets off to save Alis, his fairy friend, after she was captured by the evil sorcerer Amon. He later learns that the only way to defeat Amon is by collecting five legendary instruments which Amon has stolen.  The sorcerer placed a curse on these instruments so that their true powers cannot be used and then left them in the hands of his minions.  The only way to lift the curse is by collecting five stars.

Armed with only his bubble shooter, Milon must retrieve the legendary instruments, lift their curses and use their powers to defeat Amon and rescue Alis.

Traveling through many different worlds starting with the forest, Milon will be confronted by many enemies. Milon can either shoot bubbles to trap and send his enemies away, or he can jump and flatten his enemies temporarily turning them into a platform for him to walk across. 

Milon has three different "outfits": red, blue, and green. With the green outfit, Milon can withstand three hits. Each time he gets hit, he will be downgraded a color - green to blue, blue to red. If he gets hit with the red outfit, he will die and have to start the level over.

By collecting 100 music notes, Milon will get an extra life. There are also other useful items to get like bubble gum that will save Milon once if he were to fall, a special bubble shooter that let's him shoot multiple bubbles at once and a star that makes Milon temporarily invincible so that he can defeat enemies simply by running at them.</desc>

	<name>Dossun ! Ganseki Battle</name>
	<desc>A falling block puzzle game  in a pseudo-medieval fantasy setting that pits two characters against each other in an abstract form of combat that is quite similar to games like Columns. Combining at least three matching symbols in a vertical, horizontal or diagonal line does not only clear them off the screen, but also deals damage to an opponent. This means that players do not only have to keep their game area clear, but also pay attention to their characters health bar. Once a block touches the top of the screen or the health bar is diminished the game ends.

There are four different icons that have different effects when combined:
Books, swords and rocks deal damage to an opponent by attacking with fireballs, dragons or swords.
Bottles heal a certain amount of health.
Purple blocks have no effect, but clog up the screen nonetheless.

Chain reactions result in particularly powerful attacks or place one or more grey blocks inside the opponents area. They can be destroyed just like ordinary blocks, but they always stay in the same spot and do not fall down.

More complex chain reactions give access to special attacks, up to three of which can be held and activated with the shoulder buttons. Special attacks have different effects that include clearing all purple blocks, using all potions and clearing the bottom three lines.

The game features a single play, Vs and Tournament/story mode. The gameplay itself is similar to other baseball games in the sense that it subdivides the different stages of baseball (batting, pitching, running bases, etc.) in different "mini games" with their own camera angles and interfaces.

As expected of a Nekketsu game you can play it rough by sneaking punches and kicks to "bend" the rules a bit, you can also use the "ki" or willpower of your players to trigger special moves and strategic management is limited to specifying different base strategies and behaviors for each player.</desc>

	<name>Dragon Ball Z Super Gokuden : Kakusei Hen</name>
	<desc>This is a direct sequel to the  first "interactive fighter" for SNES, based on the popular manga/animé series Dragon Ball. The game picks up the story where it ended in the previous game, and continues through Piccolo, Saiyajin, and Freezer sagas of the manga. After the battle with the Demon King (Daimaou) Piccolo, the twenty-third World Martial Arts Tournament is about to begin. But to the amazement of the hero Son Goku and his friends, their archrival Piccolo appears during the tournament, so that it quickly turns into a genuine battle.

You control Son Goku and his son Son Gohan, switching between them as the game progresses. The game is basically an interactive comic book in which you can influence the story by choosing to press a button when the game prompts you to make a choice. You'll also participate in battles. The battle system is similar to rock-paper-scissors game, where one kind of move always beats or always loses to another. You can dash into your enemies, attack physically, and perform special moves, pressing the buttons in real time (although the battles are divided into turns).

	<path>./Dragon Ball Z - Super Saiya Densetsu (Japan) (Translated En).fig</path>
	<name>Dragon Ball Z : Legend of the Super Saiyan</name>
	<desc>Cho Saiya Densetsu is based on the popular manga/animé series Dragon Ball. It follows the events described in the beginning of Dragon Ball Z, the second story block, which tells about the connection of the hero Son Goku with a powerful alien race, and new mighty foes from far away planets. The game starts just where the tale of Dragon Ball begins. Son Goku goes to meet his friends, but is stopped by a mysterious stranger named Raditz who tells Son Goku they are relatives. Raditz demands from him to destroy humanity, and as Son Goku refuses, takes his son Son Gohan hostage. To rescue his son, Son Goku joins forces with his arch-rival, the Demon King Piccolo, who obviously has his own plans concerning Raditz. And thus begins the story during which Son Goku will learn of his true origin...

The game is a RPG similar to the card-based Dragon Ball Z RPGs for NES. During battles, you choose cards from your card inventory, which determine the nature and the strength of your characters' attacks. You can also train your characters in training houses and upgrade their special Ki power. Unlike early DBZ RPGs, you can move around freely in Cho Saiya Densetsu, and your movements are not determined by cards. You can also fly around the world and use your special Dragon Radar to discover location of magical Dragon Balls.

	<name>Dragon Quest I.II</name>
	<desc>This is a remake of two classic NES RPGs - an exclusively Japanese release of the two first Dragon Quest titles on one cartridge.

In Dragon Quest (known as Dragon Warrior in the US), you play as the descendant of the legendary warrior Erdrick, and your goal is to recover the magical Ball of Light from Erdrick's and the humanity's arch-enemy, the Dragon Lord. In Dragon Quest II, you assume the role of the descendant of the hero of the first game, and must join forces with two other characters in order to defeat a demon lord who destroyed a nearby city and killed its inhabitants. 

Both RPGs feature random battles and turn-based combat viewed from first-person perspective. In Dragon Quest you fight alone, while in the sequel two other characters can join your party, and you also fight against multiple enemies at once.

The remake includes updated graphics (although they still retain the original NES look), sound of SNES quality, and some changes in the gameplay and in the game world. Certain locations are larger, some menu commands (such as "Stairs") are omitted, and there is a larger variety of items.

	<name>Dragon Quest III</name>
	<desc>Dragon Warrior III is the concluding game of the first Dragon Quest/Dragon Warrior trilogy, and its story takes us back to the time period of the legendary Erdrick (also known as Loto), the ancestor of the first game's hero. You are the son of a powerful warrior Ortega, skillful in physical combat and spellcasting. Your father went out to fight the evil Baramos, who is responsible for the appearance of monsters in your region, and never returned. You are sent by the king on a quest to continue your father's brave deeds and to defeat Baramos.

Dragon Warrior III is a top-down role-playing game where you travel around the overworld, caves, castles, cities and other locations while battling random encounters, buying equipment, and talking to people. You and your party members receive experience when they beat up monsters and level up with enough experience, increasing their stats. The game features a day/night cycle - as you travel, day slowly changes to night and vice versa; shops are typically closed at night. 

You begin with control of just the main character but can quickly recruit three more members to your party. During the game you can choose to drop your current characters and recruit others at any time. The recruitable characters are divided into six classes: soldier, fighter, merchant, goof-off, pilgrim and wizard.

The game has a unique job system, giving you the ability to switch your hired characters' classes after they have achieved at least level 20 in their base class. Characters can switch to the other beginning classes, as well as the sage class, which is not available at the beginning. When a character switches classes, they lose all earned experience points, and half of their stats, but retain all of the abilities of the previous class. In this way, you can create powerful combination characters that are able to cast spells and fight effectively.

	<name>Dragon Quest V</name>
	<desc>You are the son of the brave warrior, Lord Papas. It appears that your mother died just after giving birth to you, and your father took you on a long journey when you were a little baby, and all you know is that he was searching for something. Now you are six years old, and Lord Papas brings you to your home village. After some time, you learn that His Highness Prince Henry was kidnapped by bandits. Your father attempts to rescue him, and during this action you discover that perhaps your mother is still alive... The game follows the story of Papas' son, and this story is stretched over years, as the hero grows and becomes a man of courage and virtue. During the game, the hero will discover the truth about his mother, and will have to make some crucial decisions, such as which girl to marry (the decisions affect the course of the game and its ending).

"Dragon Quest V" is a party RPG with turn-based combat, and battles viewed from 1st person perspective, just like all its predecessors. Your party roams about the world, fighting random enemies, performing quests, and defeating bosses. The novelty is in the game's unusual story, which spans almost a lifetime of the hero. 

"Dragon Quest V" was not available outside of Japan until 2009, when the DS version was released in the United States.

Was this just a dream? You have just fallen out of your bed dreaming! It's time to go to the village elder, to get a seemingly simple assignment - to sell some goods at a bazaar in the nearest town. But soon the hero will discover his dream was not so far away from reality...

"Dragon Quest VI" is the last SNES game of the Dragon Quest series (called "Dragon Warrior" in US). It is a party RPG with turn-based combat and battles viewed from 1st person perspective. Not much has changed since the NES days of Dragon Quest - gameplay style, setting, and even menu layout seem almost identical to those of the early classics. Like its immediate predecessor Dragon Quest V, this game was never released outside Japan.

	<desc>Long time ago, a flourishing civilization was destroyed by the rage of a mighty dragon. The Earth was set in flames, and no one escaped the destruction - no one except one man, who managed to launch himself forward, thousand years into the future. There, he was found by people of Kardosa Empire, who soon understood they have in their hands a human who possesses the secret of a superior ancient technology, that was unknown to the primitive civilization of the present...

You play the role of Aleth, the son of the High Priest in the small kingdom of Garade, whom leads a peaceful life with his friend Lagnus, Prince of Garade. One day Aleth accidentally gains possession of a precious artifact which is sought after by the Kardosa Empire. Aleth and Lagnus get involve in a conflict which will soon lead them to great discoveries of the secrets of the ancient civilization, of the great destruction that occurred thousand years ago, and of their own true identities...

The game is a console-style RPG: your party meets randomly encountered enemies and bosses, and fights them in turn-based combat viewed from isometric perspective. You upgrade armor by buying it, and also can buy weapons, but weapons can also be upgraded for money to different levels, to create powerful attacks called "techs".</desc>

While adopting the same behind-the-batter perspective as Namco's Famista series, Dynamic Stadium presents its athletes as comic book heroes rather than chibi figures, making them absurdly buff and frequently featuring action shots of them catching fly-balls and narrowly making it to base before being caught out. "Safe!" and "Out!" calls are presented as spiky word balloons.

Dynamic Stadium does not feature an official NPB license, so all the team names are fictitious. The game was published in Japan by Sammy Corporation and was never localized for overseas territories.</desc>

In Edo no Kiba you are always moving forward, either running or walking (or, in some levels, flying), although you can still move around the screen as in most belt-scrolling games. Your avatar attacks by slashing to the right with his energy sword, and he can also hold his sword defensively to deflect some bullets. By then holding forward and releasing attack he can throw the sword like a boomerang. He can also jump. A bomb follows the avatar around on any on-foot level that can be used to destroy all enemies onscreen at any time, and it will be replaced whenever a life is lost. Environments range from city streets to sewers and a flying battleship. Each level ends with a boss fight against an enemy that can withstand many attacks.</desc>

	<desc>In "Emerald Dragon", you play as Atrushan, a blue dragon who lives in the Dragon World. One day, he and his friends discover a ship wreck near a mountain. After examining the wreck, the dragons find a human child - a little girl. The wise White Dragon, the leader of the dragons, tells them that her name is Tamryn and that she will play an important role in their lives. The girl doesn't remember anything, and grows up together with the dragons. But when she turns fifteen, she decides to go back to her homeland - the Human World. Soon after Tamryn has left, Atrushan realizes he can't bear the separation, and asks the White Dragon to allow him to go and find Tamryn in the Human World. But a mysterious evil curse has been placed on the dragons - they can't appear among the humans in their true form. Atrushan agrees to become a human and goes to the Human World - to find Tamryn, and also a way to remove the curse...

The game features traditional Japanese-style RPG gameplay - Atrushan and his party travel over world map, visiting towns and descending into dungeons. The battle system is somewhat unusual - you can control only Atrushan, while other party members are controlled by the AI. You have a special bar for your actions in battle: once it is depleted, you can't perform any action and must wait for your next turn. You can move freely over the battle field, position yourself strategically near or far away from the enemy, attack from different sides, and assign general strategies to your non-controllable party members.</desc>

The objective is to solve two cases; the murder of a schoolgirl investigating her school's ghost story, and an older murder nearing legal expiration. Like the previous game in the series, the game progresses as the player chooses from a set of commands displayed on a menu. These commands are used to interact with other characters and the game's environment, examine clues, or review facts. The results of choosing each command are displayed in the text.</desc>

	<name>FEDA: The Emblem of Justice</name>
	<desc>In a fantasy world, a soldier from the imperial forces deserts after witnessing the massacre of innocent villagers by his unit. He is sent to jail to be executed, but manages to escape with the help of two former unit colleagues. The group flees through the country-side, while being pursued by imperial soldiers. On their way, they join forces with other rebels to fight against the enemy, while uncovering hidden secrets and evil plots by the Empire.

FEDA: Emblem of Justice is a strategy RPG similar to Shining Force and other titles with preset characters and linear gameplay. The player commands a party of varying size and characters with diverse skills.

In the main battle sections, the player and the CPU-controlled enemy take turns moving the troops and giving orders. A menu at the bottom of the screen shows all the possible actions, where soldiers can defend, move, attack, or use an inventory item on each turn. The range of their movements and weapons vary according to their nature. A crossbow character can shoot from the back, while most sword and knife users have to be adjacent to their targets. Magic offensive powers have different ranges as well, reaching enemies that are far away from the attacking character. Health points can be recovered by eating rations or by magic, where a healer can restore points to several characters at once.

Each party member has separate health and magic points, as well as other statistics like defense and attack power. They receive experience points after slaying an enemy or casting a spell, and extra points at the end of the battle. Their skills increase after surpassing 100 points.

The map screen shows the party and groups of enemies traveling through the landscape in turns. The menu has options for moving the group or camping. In the encampment, one of the characters around the fire pit saves the game, while another inside the tent provides system options to change the interface color, adjust sound volume and rename the party members.

In some locations like temples, villages and towns, the party has to explore the place and talk to the citizens to move on to the next section. In later battles, the player has to make a moral choice about attacking mutated humans. At the end of each battle, the party is assigned a dark or light emblem, and certain party members choose to leave or stay in the group based on its alignment.</desc>

	<name>Final Fantasy II</name>
	<desc>This is the fourth entry in the  Final Fantasy series. It was known as Final Fantasy II internationally, because the  second and third games were never released outside of Japan.

The military country of Baron is one of the strongest in the land, with a proud army and a majestic air force known as the Red Wings. But, while their armies are kind and loyal, the recent actions of the King are anything but. The young Captain of the Red Wings, Cecil, is ordered to steal a crystal from a village of innocent magicians, and when he questions the actions of his King, Cecil is immediately thrown out of the country and sent off to kill strange monsters. Little does he realize the price the King's actions will pay, and what the true secret of the crystals, and their powers, truly is...

This is the first Final Fantasy game that introduced the famous ATB (active-time battle) system: during the battles, you have a time indicator for each party member that tells you when this character is able to act. If it takes you too long to select a command for this character, the enemy will act without waiting for your turn. The game abandons the job system that was implemented in the first and the third game in favor of pre-set character classes (paladin, white mage, ninja, etc.) assigned to each party member.

The PlayStation version adds a new rendered intro and ending.</desc>

	<name>Final Fantasy V</name>
	<desc>The Elemental Crystals...the life source of the planet. With them, gentle winds blow, the seas are active, fire burns bright, and the earth is full of life. All seems well in the world, until the wind suddenly stops, the sea begin to grow stagnant, the heat of fire becomes scarce, and the earth begins to wither. King Tycoon, sensing a premonition of evil, hurries off to check on the Wind Crystal, only to witness it destroy itself.

Meanwhile, a young traveler named Butz is camping in a field when a giant meteor strikes the planet. When he heads out to examine the meteor, he is shocked to find a young girl named Lenna, who is the princess of Tycoon, and a old man named Galuf, who is on a critical mission. Later, joined by Faris, a pirate captain, the foursome must travel the land in search of the destructor of the Crystals, and save the planet at any cost!

Final Fantasy V featured many new gameplay options and tactics, including an improved Job/Ability system (like in Final Fantasy Tactics), the return of the ATB (Active Time Battle) turn system, and all of the classic FF gameplay you've come to know and love!

Final Fantasy V was released as a stand-alone game in Japan, and again in Final Fantasy Collection. Its U.S. debut was as part of Final Fantasy Anthology. It was also later ported to the Gameboy Advance, adding 4 new Jobs, a new 30-floor dungeon, a bestiary, a music player, the ability to quick save anywhere, a few extra pieces of equipment, and a newly update translation.</desc>

	<name>Final Fantasy III</name>
	<desc>This is the sixth entry in the  Final Fantasy series. It was called Final Fantasy III because three of the five previous installments of the series were never released outside of Japan.

1,000 years ago, the War of the Magi occurred. People remember it as one of the most horrible tragedies in history. Since the War of the Magi, magic has been all but forgotten, technology began to grow, and people returned to seemingly normal lives. The only true worry people had was the Empire, whose leaders were looking to revive the great force once known as "magic".

But then...something happened that would change the course of history forever...

The Empire had heard word of the remains of a mystical being, known as an "Esper", being found in the mining town of Narshe. Quickly, three soldiers were dispatched to find this Esper and bring it to the Emperor. One of the soldiers, a young girl, triggers a power in the Esper that will begin one of the most dangerous series of events ever. And the only ones who can help her are a rag-tag band of rebels and heroes, whose very hearts and souls are the only ones that can save the world from the mad plans of the Empire.

The game maintains the ATB (active time battle) system of the two previous Final Fantasy games, spicing classic turn-based combat engine with a real-time element. The customization system combines character-specific classes with free-flowing character development. By finding various Espers and equipping them on characters, you can improve their parameters in different ways and choose the magic spells you want to learn for each character.</desc>

	<desc>A remake and expansion of the first NES/Famicom Fire Emblem, Marth must face the betrayal if Hardin and an old enemy he thought long vanquished, the Dragon King Medeus.

Book 1 of the game is essentially a remake of the first NES game. Book 2 continues the story with the same characters.

This game expands the series, however it drops explorable towns and the navigation through a world map which was introduced in Fire Emblem: Gaiden. New features include the ability to dismount the horse and pegasus mounted units, to allow the riders to fight indoors if needed.

At its most simple the story is of Prince Leaf of Lenster's struggle to free his native land from two forces, the Grandbell Empire and the Loptus religion.

Features introduced into this part of the series include fog of war and night maps with limited vision, this requires characters to use torches and wands to light their way. Also the capture command which allowed enemies to be subdued and their weapons taken.

	<name>From TV animation - Slam Dunk SD Heat Up!!</name>
	<desc>Among the most famous Japanese comics of the 90s are definitely Slam Dunk. The manga tells of the running track that will make the young hoodlum Hanamichi Sakuragi who joined the basketball club in Shohoku high school just because initially interested in the sister of the captain Akagi but later this sport will conquer him so much that he becomes a real basketman.

The game is essentially an arcade sports title basketball basically. The main screen there will be little choice given the presence of only three modes: Story mode and classic friendly tournament. In the first we follow the events of the television series whose plot differs slightly from the original one: using Shohoku then we will qualify for the national championship. The second and third but I think there is a need for further explanation.

Executable field operations would also be different, you can also feint shots and blow up their opponents markers. Then successfully accumulating a sequence of 'affirmative action' row (steps succeeded, baskets made or avoided), will fill a horizontal bar at the top of the screen and, as he did a little 'in the playroom with the SNK Street Hoop, pressing simultaneously the three keys will not dorsal (except B), you can make a super nice shooting with supplemental animations depending on the player used.

	<path>./Front Mission (Japan) [T-En by FH v1.0b].fig</path>
	<name>Front Mission</name>
	<desc>In the future, many military forces are dependent on huge mech robots, called Wanzers (Walking Panzers) for combat. At Huffman Island, located in the the pacific ocean, wanzers are deployed by both the USN (United States of the New Continent) and the OCU (Oceana Community Union), who dispute ownership over the island.  One night, the OCU forces stage a covert recon mission on a facility located in Larcus, a USN-held territory and weapons facility. Lead by a soldier named Roid, this mission was entirely unofficial and violated the peace treaty. During the mission, USN forces lead by Commander Driscoll appeared and ambushed the OCU soldiers. During the combat, Roid's fiance, Karen is killed and the USN facility is blown up; placing the blame on the OCU. This became known as the &amp;quot;Larcus Incident&amp;quot; and the OCU denied all knowledge of it's soldiers actions. Ultimately it would be a leading cause to the second Huffman War. 

One year later, the war is underway and Huffman island is under provisional control of the OCU, but with a weakened military unable to defend against USN attacks. The soldiers involved involved in the Larcus Incident have all been discharged and disgraced. Roid spends his time fighting as a gladiator in the Wanzer fighting arena before being approached by a mysterious man. Colonel Olson has found out about Roid's history and wants him to command a mercenary unit he is assembling on behalf of the OCU, dubbed &amp;quot;Carrion Crow&amp;quot;. Convincing Roid that Driscoll is still out there on the island, Roid agrees.

Front Mission is a turn-based strategy RPG played from an isometric perspective. Players progress in the story through large strategic battles involving multiple units and cutscenes between them. At certain places, usually towns, the player can visit multiple locations including bars and shops, and talk to people. Shops are also found to purchase new weaponry, parts and make repairs. In combat, each Wanzer robot is a seperate unit and, has a large variety of weapons and attack styles depending on what's equipped. Units get experience for defeating enemies and also for using various techniques. The more an attack is used, the more powerful it becomes.</desc>

	<path>./Front Mission Series - Gun Hazard (Japan) [T-En by Aeon Genesis v1.01].fig</path>
	<name>Front Mission - Gun Hazard</name>
	<desc>The year is 2064, when the great solar power satellite, ATLAS is overshadowed by the invention of fusion power. The government alliance that had supported the building of ATLAS now find themselves facing economic crisis as the balance of power shifts. In this world of conflict and change, the Walking Panzer, or Wanzer, (a form of mecha) becomes the standard armored unit for wars and petty battles across the globe. For the small nation of Bergen, a coup d'etat is underway, staged by Colonel Ark. Seeking to establish complete control over the government and the NORAD units stationed there, Ark's first step involves the capture of President Orwen. Tipped off to the rebellion, Orwen seeks to flee from Bergen, looking for safe passage out of the seaport of Port Ertothal. A young Wanzer pilot, Albert Grabner, is assigned escort duty to the president by loyal elements of the army stationed there...

Gun Hazard is a side-scrolling version of the Front Mission series. Gameplay is more than a little similar to Cybernator or Metal Warriors. The player moves between different stages on an area map. Once inside a level, the player controls Albert and his wanzer as it moves left, right across the screen. The wanzer is able to jump, and attack with a primary and a special weapon. At any time during a level, Albert can eject from his heavily armed wanzer to explore. Although vulnerable when outside, Albert is able to reach areas the wanzer cannot, in addition to being a smaller target and being able to jetpack indefinitely.

Additionally, Albert can recruit other characters through the normal course of the story, some of whom can be designated to support roles. These support characters when set can provide a variety of different cover fire abilities for Albert during his missions. They too gain experience and levels. Different weapons and armor can be found or bought. Essential components include the Booster ability which allows the wanzer to hover and increase it's jumps, as well as the Dash ability which allows quick left-right movement by the wanzer. Money and experience are earned through the completion of level objectives as well as the kill count of enemy wanzers.</desc>

	<name>Fushigi no Dungeon 2 - Fuurai no Shiren</name>
	<desc>The legend of the Golden Condor... from village to village and  from town to town, everybody speak of it - somewhere, beyond forests and mountains, there lies an idyllic Golden Land, the land of eternal happiness. Many adventurers have tried to find their way to the mysterious land of the Golden Condor, but how many of them have survived the impassable mountain paths, the dark forests and caves, and the vicious monsters? You are the wanderer Shiren, and the goal of your life is to find the Golden Land. Together with your best buddy Koppa, a talking weasel, you decide to venture deep into the dungeons that lead to the land, and to try your luck there.

Furai no Shiren (The Wanderer Shiren) is a roguelike, hack-and-slash game with randomly generated dungeon areas, items, and monsters. Despite being named Fushigi no Dungeon 2 it has no relation to the storyline or characters of the first game in the series, it does however share the same style of gameplay. The movement is turn-based. You visit towns and villages where you can buy and sell supplies. The dungeons are full of various traps and monsters, and sometimes non-playable characters you can talk to, some of which can join you on your quest.

	<path>./Galaxy Wars (Japan).fig</path>
	<name>Galaxy Wars</name>
	<desc>Home version of the 1979 arcade game of the same name. The aim is to launch missiles from the bottom of the screen at enemy spacecraft located at the top. To get there, the missile must pass through a asteroid belt flying across the screen and avoid the shots being fired down from the spacecraft. It is the players job to control the missile. Once launched it can be moved left and right and can be sped up by using the boost to speed it's way out of trouble. Points scored depend on the location of the hit on the enemy spacecraft. The speed at which enemy spacecraft move increases as the number of them decreases. Once all spacecraft have been destroyed, another wave starts, the speed decreases again and the process repeats. A life is lost when a missile is hit by a shot or collides with an asteroid.

Three game modes are available, B&amp;W and Color recreate the graphics and behaviour of the original arcade game in black &amp; white and color respectively whilst Neo mode updates the game with improved graphics and slightly different behaviour. There's also a turn-based two player mode. Other options include changing the number of lives available at the start of a game and the number of points needed for an extra ship.</desc>

	<desc>As you may have guessed from the number 2 in the title, this is the second SNES game in the popular blend of the adventure and jump and run genres which is the Goemon series. Again, you (and your partner, in 2 player mode) control Goemon, his friend Ebisu-Maru and, new to the bunch, robot Sasuke, through loads of action stages and villages. Another new feature comes with 3D boss fights, featuring the giant mech type robot called "Goemon Impact".

	<name>Ganbare Goemon 3</name>
	<desc>Third title in the Ganbare Goemon series of platform/adventure games which cast you as the heroic Goemon as he attempts to save feudal Japan from all sorts of wacky evildoers. This time around, a time-travelling machine threatens all of Japan and thus Goemon and co. must jump into the future to stop the machine.

The game alternates between a top-down world map view in which your characters explore the gameworld and side-scrolling stages in which the main action lies. As in most games of the series there are also loads of mini-games and unique gameplay sequences such as maneuvering Goemon's giant mecha.

The game continues the tradition of bizarre humor unique to the series, you can play as either Goemon or any of his 3 companions, Ebisumaru, Sasuke or Yae with each sporting unique weapons and abilities and also with their own dialogue options and cutscenes, which feature sitcom-like pre-recorded laughs for added wackiness.

	<desc>Fourth title in the Ganbare Goemon series of platform/adventure games which cast you as the heroic Goemon and his gang of wacky adventurers as he fights evil all over Japan. This sequel however, takes the action to outer space as the gang attempts to rescue Goemon Impact (Goemon's giant mecha) from a strange planet.

The game is based around a stage-select hub from which you select which character you want to play as and then attempt to clear the game's many side scrolling stages in standard action platformer fashion, navigating the obstacles and defeating all enemies you run into with your weapons. Since each one of Goemon's allies got stranded on a different planet, you must take control of each one of them in order to clear the stages and recover the special ability unique to each character that must be later put to use to release Goemon Impact. As in other games of the series there are also loads of mini-games and unique gameplay sequences triggered in boss fights, bonus stages and special situations. These involve shooter sequences, racing &amp; sport games and other assorted diversions.</desc>

In Ganbare Daiku no Gensan, you must go through five stages (with two areas each), destroying workers that get in your way using your mallet. You can use it to perform two special attacks. One that sends fireballs going in all directions, and a more powerful one that sends shockwaves, destroying everything on screen.

	<path>./Ganpuru - Gunman's Proof (Japan) (Translated En).fig</path>
	<name>Gunple: Gunman's Proof</name>
	<desc>The year is 1880. Two meteors fell on Earth on a small island near North American Pacific Coast. In the middle of the island there is a small town governed by a sheriff. At first, the town's inhabitants didn't pay attention to the meteors. But then, strange things started happening. Monsters attacked people, and left on the victims' bodies a mysterious crest with one word: demiseed. One day you, a young boy who lives in the town, are contacted by two aliens who came in a miniature space ship. One of the aliens introduces himself as Zero, the Space Sheriff, and explains that an intergalactic criminal named Demi has escaped from justice and is hiding somewhere on the island, being the cause of all the troubles lately. Zero then possesses your body, lends you his powers, and commands you on the quest to destroy Demi and to bring peace to your island and to the alien world alike!

The game is an action/adventure with slight RPG elements (buying and upgrading weapons, etc.) set in Wild West. While featuring traditional dungeon-crawling and many enemies to dispose of in real time combat, the game doesn't equip you with standard medieval swords, but with pistols, shotgun, machine gun, and even a flamethrower. Your weapons have infinite ammo. You can duck to avoid the alien monsters' fire, and perform special attacks with various types of weapons.</desc>

	<desc>One year ago they took from you your wife. Now it's time to pay them back, with interest.

Gekitotsu Dangan Jidousha Kessen: Battle Mobile plays similarly to Spyhunter in both perspective and objective, but your car in Battle Mobile isn't quite as high tech an instrument as that other game's vehicle. You can launch unlimited missiles, but they can only hit helicopters. For ground based targets you must dash into them to ram them off the road. Your car's health is constantly dwindling, even when you're not being attacked by enemies, so picking up the occasionally appearing energy refill items is essential. Shields can be picked up and stored that will make your car invulnerable to all damage for a short while.</desc>

	<name>Genocide 2</name>
	<desc>The world is still recovering from war. The mega-corporation CONEX has been spearheading the rebuilding process, but their true intentions are far from altruistic. By gobbling up their competition, and with the help of new weapons technology, CONEX is on the cusp of controlling the world. Only a hero from the last war can defy them and stop their plans of conquest.

Genocide 2 is a modified version of the PC release. The player takes control of a ten meter tall robotic ninja: the Tracer. Its only form of attack is a sword, but it can hold several extra weapons, and always has access to the Betty. The Betty can be fired in eight directions, returns to the Tracer after being fired, and can block enemy bullets. The objective of each stage is to reach the end, and some stages require you to destroy targets along the way. Any items picked up by the player, or damage done to the Tracer, carries over between stages, and each stage records your fastest time for beating them.

Aside from the visual downgrade, Genocide 2 also lost many minor enemy types and one mid-boss in the transition to the Super Famicom. The first stage was removed, and the first two levels of stage 2 were reversed. The Betty now can only be used for a limited time, and must recharge when its time has run out.</desc>

	<desc>Ghost Chaser Densei doesn't take any dramatic departures from the standard scrolling-brawler plot-line. A city twenty minutes in the future must be saved from a terrorist organization, and between salvation and you is a long, straight line full of goons who must be punched. Aside from receiving orders from your boss before each level, and the quick conversation with a boss or rare NPC, the story won't attempt to get in the way of beat-downs.

There are three playable characters in Ghost Chaser Densei: the martial artist Makai, the mace wielding cat-girl Iyo, and the autonomous robot Belva. Each has unique moves as well as the basic abilities of attacking, jumping, blocking, throwing, and using a special if attack and jump are pressed together. Unlike most brawlers these special moves deplete a recharging special bar, not your health. Makai can throw fireballs and do a flying kick in midair, Iyo can triangle jump and preform a spinning piledriver, and Belva can double jump and preform a grapple special. Characters also have a team up special if playing in two player mode. Enemies range from armored soldiers to lizard men to robots, but most break down into the same hierarchy: weaker types will rush at you while stronger types will shoot projectiles then rush at you. Each level ends with a unique boss with multiple short and long range attacks.</desc>

	<desc>Ackman is not what one would call a good person. His job is to murder and steal souls for the Demon Lord. The angel Tenshi has taken it upon himself to put an end to Ackman's nefarious ways, and sends an army of angels and hired assassins to take out Ackman for good. It's just as well, because Ackman was getting bored without anyone to kill.

Go Go Ackman is a scrolling platformer starring the titular Ackman. Ackman can punch and charge up a ranged wave of energy, and he can also jump on some enemies to stun them before running into them and turning them into a sliding projectile. Ackman can hold up to three bombs that can clear the screen of enemies, and can also hold a weapon, either a sword, boomerang, or pistol, but it will be lost if Ackman is hit. Levels are linear, but do allow some exploration to find weapons and items hidden off the beaten road.</desc>

The angel Tenshi is still determined to end Ackman's nefarious ways, and this time he has enlisted the help of the angelic rock band Metal Angel. Ackman still murders at whim and has his companion Godon collect the souls of his slain, but this time Ackman can keep the weapons he finds, either sword, boomerang, or gun. Each weapon can be upgraded twice, but upgrades will be lost if Ackman is hit or finds a new weapon. Ackman can also now throw smaller enemies, although he can't move while holding them.

But, what's this, it seems there's been a shake up in the chain of command, and now Tenshi is wanted by the Angel Police! Will Tenshi be able to clear his good name? Who's really pulling the strings here? And, most importantly, does Ackman care about any of this at all?

The last of the Ackman games, Go Go Ackman 3 makes very few changes from Go Go Ackman 2, although Tenshi is now a playable character. Both Ackman and Tenshi can be switched between at special points in a level, but they share the same health meter and weapon. Unlike Ackman Tenshi can fly, but as he is an angel he can not collect the souls of enemies he kills. Souls have changed too, and are now used as currency in shops where Ackman can buy temporary powerups or healing. Finally Ackman has lost the ability to slide enemies along the ground, but he can now move while holding a stunned enemy.</desc>

	<name>Gokujou Parodius</name>
	<desc>Konami's Gradius and space-shooter parody series continues with this second installment.  Gameplay is similar to the Gradius series in that you control a ship that can move anywhere on the screen while the screen itself scrolls from left to right. Enemies appear in waves and destroying all the fighters in a single wave releases power-ups which may be used to choose your ships upgrade. The Upgrade bar too is lifted from Gradius, however each character has different names and functions for their upgrades.

In Gokujyou Parodius, you are now able to now choose from 11 different characters... many of whom appear from other Konami games. They include:

1. Vic Viper: a ship from Gradius

2. Takosuke: the "octopus" of the previous Parodius game, and also seen in at least one Goemon

3. Twinbee: making his appearance from the Twinbee side scrolling games, Twinbee is a squat round robot with a jetpack and a disproportionately big punching glove

4. Pentaro: the original "joke character", Pentaro made an appearence in a previous Gradius title as a flying penguin. However he does star in his own games as well, Konami's Penguin Adventure

5. Hikaru: Hikaru is a girl in a tight fighting "bunny suit" who is riding on top of a missile

6. Mambo: Mambo is a strange looking fish with two horns on the top of his head and on his underside

7. Michael: some kind of fat angel pig. He has wings and a golden halo over his head

8. Koitsu: A blue stick man riding on a surfboard. He's probably one of the more 'normal' characters

9. Goemon: star of the Goemon series of games. Goemon is a ninja warrior equipped with wooden pipes. He flies around in a superman pose for his appearance in Parodius

10. Dracula: star of Konami's Kid Dracula, this white haired squat character retains his vampiric abilities including that of being able to change into a bat

11. Upa: a flying baby. Upa is actually from a Konami game by the name of Bokutte Upa but is probably just more recognizable as "the flying baby" of this crazy shooter

In addition to your player-character, the levels themselves will be full of a strange mix of Konami references, bright colors and the just plain zany. it's not uncommon to have to fly your ship underneath a woman's legs for example or chased by a giant walrus or having enemies shooting cute pink hearts at you.</desc>

	<desc>In Gourmet Sentai: Bara Yarou the player picks from three characters: Bonjour, Mademoiselle, and Très Bien. Each has slightly different movesets to use on downed or stunned opponents, but each posses the punch, throw, and jump usual for belt-scrolling brawlers. The characters must get past several minor enemies on each level before fighting a stronger boss at the end. Each enemy will drop a cooking ingredient when defeated, and at the end of each level two ingredients can be combined to make a meal that will restore some health based on if the chosen character likes it or not. Environments range from slums and palaces to high speed trains and space ships, but in general there is not much continuity between different areas.</desc>

Reiko is armed with a magic baton that can be used to perform several types of melee attacks. The baton can be powered up to shoot various types of projectiles, though these powerups are lost if Reiko takes any damage. It can also be used as a type of grappling hook to access certain platforms. There are also limited uses of magic attacks that hit all enemies on the screen.</desc>

	<path>./GT Racing (Japan).fig</path>
	<name>GT Racing</name>
	<desc>GT Racing is a Super Famicom racing video game where the player gets to drive a Gran Turismo car in either championship or practice mode.  The game is based on the 1996 Super GT racing season using the horsepower standards and rules of the era.  

During championship mode, the player is asked enter a number, his or her driver's name, and the team name that he or she will use during the championship. The driver's name and team can be entered using either English or Japanese letters. When a player beats a record, he or she is asked to insert his or her number, name or initials (up to four characters and two digits for the number). Championship mode can last for multiple seasons. Playing ninety-nine seasons in a single racing career is theoretically possible due to the double-digit nature of the season information. There are eight different tracks, including the Suzuka Circuit that has been shown in video games since Pole Position II and Fuji Speedway (complete with a virtually photorealistic Mount Fuji in the background).

Versus mode is for two human players only and the record options allows the players to look at his or her previous records. In a race, there are up to fifteen opponents to race against. The player gets rewarded with an opportunity to upgrade his or her equipment after a top five finish on any race course. Bonus equipment includes a faster engine, better tires, and a special dose of nitrous oxide created specifically for Gran Turismo vehicles. All of the bonus automobile parts are automatically installed in the appropriate parts for supercharging the vehicle. Once all the special parts are earned, the automobile is considered to be fully upgraded. The ultimate goal is to win the Gran Turismo championship for his or her team in addition for him/herself.

The "free practice" is essentially a time trial mode where the player races by him/herself for up to ten laps. Acquiring damage is still possible either crashing into walls or through normal wear and tear. The fastest lap time gets captured for the record book just like in the other modes of the game. Before being able to practice freely, the player can also choose the weather condition and the setup of his vehicle</desc>

	<name>Hameln no Violin Hiki</name>
	<desc>In Violinist of Hameln you play the role of Hamel, a sort of wanderer / adventurer whose weapon is a violin. His music can cover enemies in fear, or even control their minds. Hamel and his mascot Oboe arrives at Staccato, a small town attacked by monsters, and drives them away with his power. Impressed, a cute little girl named Flute decides to go with Hamel in order to find and destroy the evil power behind the attacks.

The game is typical platform. You play as Hamel, and with your violin can shoot musical notes to beat your enemies. However, you count with Flutes aid. Flute follows you (although you can order her to stop and stay), but also can be grabbed and thrown at the enemies (yes, thrown at the enemies). Flute can also collect through all the stages some costumes that, when worn, give her special abilities, such as flying, leaping, breaking walls or even explode and kill all in screen. At the end of each stage, of course, youll find the typical boss, all named as musical instruments.

	<name>Hat Trick Hero 2</name>
	<desc>Hat Trick Hero 2 is the follow up to Hat Trick Hero, and it is loosely based on the arcade game Hat Trick Hero '93. One or two players can play in a exhibition game (one single match) or in a world league. The game scrolls horizontally uses mode 7 graphics to give the playing field some perspective.

There are 18 countries to select from, each with different running, kicking and technical abilities. You can use 5 different formations, which are 4-4-2, 4-3-3, 3-5-2, WM and libero. You also select a team captain from 8 different characters.

You can perform a foul tackle on the opponent, but when the referee is close enough to notice it you risk getting a yellow or red card. By holding down a direction after shooting the players can shoot the ball with curve effect. During the game a power-up bar is charged which can be used for special abilities. Holding down R allows you to run faster, but this slowly drains the power-up bar. With a fully charged power-up bar you can perform an unstoppable hyper shoot by pressing a special combination, and this drains the power-up bar entirely.</desc>

Cast into the role of a young boy from a remote village, you live a peaceful life until one day the pigs in your village go crazy, and as a result you are thrown underground, only to be saved by mysterious fairies. Something goes wrong, and the world as you knew it doesn't exist any more. You must establish contact to the great gods and other famous characters from the Greek mythology in order to restore the balance.

Like the previous games of the series, this is a standard console-style RPG with turn-based combat viewed from first-person perspective. There is a day/night cycle, which influences not only the appearance of the world map and the towns, but also the schedules of the world's inhabitants.</desc>

	<desc>The three RPGs (Hokuto no Ken 3-5) seemed to symbolize a genre change after the first two platformers, but the series changes the genre once again in the sixth installment, which is a fighting game similar to  Street Fighter II or  Mortal Kombat. The background story is based on the manga/animé of the same name. The years is 199X, and the world lies in ruins. Technology can no longer be used, and the land is controlled by fighters of rivaling styles. In this game, you can choose one of the fighter characters of the series: the main hero Kenshiro, his brother and rival Raou, Nanto Seiken fighters Rei and Souther, the assassin Heart, and others. You fight one-on-one, filling an energy bar and performing various attacks and techniques. There is a free fight mode where you choose your opponent yourself, and a two-player mode.

	<desc>Similar to the  sixth installment of the series, this is a fighting game along the lines of Street Fighter or Mortal Kombat. It is based on the main storyline of the manga/animé series Hokuto no Ken, also known as Fist of the North Star. 

After a terrible disaster mankind has stopped advancing the technology, and the world became a huge wasteland, controlled by fighter organizations. The main hero, Kenshirou of the Hokuto Shinken school, falls in love with a girl named Julia, who is abducted by one of the Nanto Seiken fighters, Shin. 

In the game, the player can choose to fight as various characters from the series, including Kenshirou, his brother Raou, the Emperor Souther, the leader of Nanto Seiken Rei, and others. There are three modes in the game: story mode, battle mode, and free fight mode.

1. In story mode, the player fights as Kenshirou in pre-determined battles that reflect the story of the series (like facing the assassin Heart). 
In battle mode, the player participates in a tournament by choosing one of the characters. 
In free fight mode, the player choses characters as well as the opponents. During battles, the player must first accumulate energy in order to unleash devastating techniques unique to each character.

	<name>Holy Umbrella: Dondera no Mubo</name>
	<desc>In "Holy Umbrella", you control a schoolboy who lives in modern-day Japan. One day, the sky suddenly turns dark blue, a heavy rain falls onto the city, and the boy finds, halfway between his house and the school, an umbrella which seems to have fallen from the sky. What he does not know is that the umbrella is magical! The moment he touches it, he is transfered to a parallel universe. Immediately, he is attacked by a huge tank, but a strange old man with a talking bird saves him. It seems that an evil creature named Dondera is threatening the country with the terrible monsters she created. But is it really so? You visit the capital town, talk to the emperor, and decide to investigate the matter...

"Holy Umbrella" is essentially a platform action game, but unlike most other games of this genre, it allows you to visit towns, where you control your hero in a standard RPG-like top-down fashion. You can enter houses, talk to townspeople, etc. On platform levels, which are the main part of the game, you have to switch between the hero, the talking bird Bonto who accompanies you on your quest, and the girl Saki, whom you meet later in the game. Every character has his/her own special abilities and own ways of fighting: the hero can slide through air by using the umbrella, Bonto can double-jump on high ledges, Saki can jump on walls, etc. You use your umbrella as a weapon, as well as elemental stones you can collect on your way and throw at enemies. You also find various power-ups and items you can equip on the hero.</desc>

	<name>The Iron Commando</name>
	<desc>Iron commando is a brawler beat-em-up like Final Fight or Streets of Rage with lots of weapons and big end bosses.

The B-movie story is cheesy and does nothing more than accommodate for the action. From the introduction sequence: "The peril came from outer space. A meteorite entered the earth's atmosphere bringing chaos. After observation, the scientists found that the meteorite was radioactive and had to be destroyed. Unfortunately, terrorists from g.h.o.s.t. want the meteorite too. The Iron Commando's mission is to retrieve the deadly body and avoid genetic mutation."

The player or players walk along the levels beating up enemies. On some levels you ride a motorcycle or jeep, even a mine kart, and shoot your way through hordes of enemies. There are several end bosses, some are screen filling like a helicopter and a giant robot.

Some enemies will drop food, grenades or weapons as you beat them into a bloody pulp. There are lots of different Weapons: 9mm guns, shotguns, machine guns, knives, baseball bats. The weird thing is, enemies that use a sword and even dogs will occasionally drop a machine gun or baseball bat.

	<desc>Jaleco Rally: Big Run: The Supreme 4WD Challenge is a rally racing game and sim in which the player takes part in the Paris-Dakar rally. The game actually begins in Tripoli, Libya and passes through around 2,500 miles of African desert, swamp and jungle on the way to Dakar.Jaleco originally developed the game for the Arcades before porting it to the Super Famicom. This home version was never released outside of Japan. The game was also ported to the Amiga and Atari ST, where it is known simply as Big Run.GameplayIn addition to passing each checkpoint under the required time - the checkpoint system ubiquitous in solo racing games of the era - the player must also be aware of environmental dangers along the course and needs to select a sponsor, navigator and engineer team before starting. They must also balance the weight of their car, as too few replacement parts might cause a problem further into the race yet having too many will greatly reduce the car's top speed.</desc>

	<desc>The game involves going through 8 stages (broken up into two parts each) of side-scrolling action. At the end of each stage is a boss monster that must be disposed of.

Jerry moves by sliding across the ground and can latch on to walls and climb them. Jerry can also jump, stretch out to cling to ceilings, and also move at a faster pace. Jerry can consume balls that he finds during a stage and can then fire them out of his body at enemies blocking his path. Enemies can also be defeated by jumping on them and then flattening Jerry's body on them. Also, there are flowers that contain items for Jerry to collect. Items include life, which refills health, a 1-up that adds an extra life, and a seed, which will grow a climbable beanstalk when planted. If the player collects the scattered letters that appear in every stage that spell out the name Jerry, the player will earn two extra lives.</desc>

	<path>./Jikkyou Oshaberi Parodius (Japan).fig</path>
	<name>Jikkyou Oshaberi Parodius</name>
	<desc>The third in the Paroidus series, it's the same gameplay and zaniness that substantiated the first two games. Gameplay itself is a copy (a parody rather) of Konami's famous Gradius series in that the screen scrolls from left to right (most times) and you maneuver around the screen destroying waves of enemies and avoiding obstacles. Unlike previous Parodius titles, this game contains a difficulty adjustment option, allowing the player to make things easier... or harder. Also unique to this parodius title is a bit of japanese digital voice that shouts out various things at you while you play. Survival throughout the level earns you a boss fight, which frequently includes some of the strangest characters in the game. Make no mistake, this *is* Gradius,  but with all sorts of strange graphics, music and references to other Konami games... So in other words, it's Parodius!

There are now more power-ups than ever including the standard power-up (red, used to upgrade weapons), the shield power-up (blue) and a variety of different coloured bells. Green Bells will make you huge on the screen, Yellow Bells are worth points (points in turn are worth extra lives), Blue Bells are "big bombs" that clear the screen of enemies/shots and can be saved until you need them, White Bells will give your character a megaphone that will shout out japanese phrases, the characters of the phrases themselves can be used to damage enemies (the power of words!), The Red Bell stockpiles you with three point-defense lasers... only one of which can be activated at a time and disappear after a short while. Finally the purple bell will clear the screen of all but the strongest enemies... and will turn them into power-ups.

This time around there are 16 different characters to chose from and the power-ups and weapons that they use are more unique than ever. Several familiar "faces" return and they've brought along friends to share in the party:
Vic Viper: The "gradius ship" appears once again in this gradius parody, equipped with it's traditional gradius weapons
2. Lord British: The "other" Gradius ship and arguably the more famous of the two. Lord British has weapons similar to Vic but quite different also.Missiles and shields work differently for instance. And Lord British uses a Ripple gun instead of a double shot.
3. Pentaro: It just wouldn't be a Parodius game if Pentaro wasn't involved. Originally from Konami's Penguin Adventure, Pentaro retains the same abilities from previous Parodius games... however his Potion weapon may now hit multiple enemies and his normal weapon shots explode against obstacles
4. Hanako: Also from Penguin Adventure, Hanako the penguin is Pentaro's girlfriend. While Pentaro is blue, she is the red penguin. She plays nearly identical to Pentaro with the exception of her S. Bomb weapon
5. Twinbee: Twinbee, from the Twinbee games is another returning Parodius star. Unfortunately he hasn't been upgraded since previous games, so his weapons are nearly identical; Punching Glove Rocket and all...
6. Winbee: Winbee, also from Twinbee is red and has moves identical to Twinbee, except for one difference... when she has 3 Options available, she can power them up to harm enemies that touch them.
7. Tako: Again, it just wouldn't be a parodius game without a flying octopus. And here he is, still wearing a baseball cap, but otherwise unchanged from previous Parodius games.
8. Belial: A yellow female octopus with a bow in her hair, she is identical to Tako with the exception of her Missile and Double weapons... which are instead identical to the Vic Viper.
9. Soitsu: A stickman (now green) surfing aboard a paper airplane, Soitsu plays similar to Koitsu from the previous game, aside from his colour. His laser weapon is able to charge up to deliver more power and he drops little stickmen onto the ground which occasionally dance around rather than attacking. Additionally he has an "upgrade power" (S. Power) that make all his other abilities stronger
10. Doitsu: Similar to Soitsu but with a Double Laser ability. He is an orange stickman riding on a paper airplane and no "upgrade" power, using normal options instead
11. Upa: Upa aka The Flying Baby is back from the previous Parodius game (as well as his original game, Bokutte Upa) and plays nearly the same. Instead of a shield, he has a Mega Crush power that damages all on-screen enemies... and also has an "Upgrade Power" in the form of Grade Up that makes his other abilities stronger.
12. Rupa: Another flying baby (presumably also from Bokutte Upa), Rupa plays similar tot Upa but with a Multi Spread gun which fires missiles in multiple directions (with each upgrade) and a S.Vulcan gun which automatically aims towards enemies.
13. Mike: A cute little kitten who happens to to have a very powerful wave weapon which can travel through obstacles and enemies. Additionally he has a multiple bomb ability which requires his "upgrade ability" (Grade Up) to get really powerful
14. Rani: Another cute kitten (this one rolled onto his bottom facing forward) with very power weaponry. Some of the highlights include a Reflect weapon wherein the shots bounce off of obstacles. Another is the S laser which travels forward but then homes in Up or Down to hit the enemy. And finally, Rani's missile weapon is two homing bells. Rani also has an "upgrade ability" in the form of Grade Up, however it only upgrades the Reflect Shot.
15. Memim: One of the fairy characters, Memim is a female flying girl with standard female bikini clothing. She carries some unique missile weapons however, whose direction is determined by Memim's current location on the screen when fired.
16. Sue: The other fairy with tight clothing, Sue is unique in that her weapons are upgraded/displayed in a different order from everybody else's in the game. For instance her Option is the 4th weapon on the list rather than the 6th... requiring less power-ups to activate it. However aside from that... all of her weapons are the exact same as the Vic Viper's.</desc>

Select your character with his unique stats and movesets, and go at it against any opponent from four fictional leagues with dozens of moves, submission holds and rope maneuvers in or out of the ring.

The game uses pre-rendered 2D sprites and features Vs, Tournament, and League play for up to four players. Also included is a career mode where you create a wrestler and control each aspect of his career up to his final victory in the inter-league tournament. And you can also configure matches to be standard, tag (with 4 or 6 wrestlers), submission or death-matches which adds such features as live wires and explosives to the ring.</desc>

	<name>Jojo no Kimy na Bken</name>
	<desc>One of the earliest titles based on the animé series Jojo's Bizarre Adventures, this game is not a pure fighter, like Capcom's more known title, but an adventure/RPG hybrid with turn-based fights.

In a futuristic world, there lives a young man named Jojo who holds a terrible power within: the power to drain life from enemies. This power is somehow connected to the evil vampire Dio who is terrorizing the world. Jojo must find faithful companions on his quest to restore peace and to master the power within himself.

In this game, you navigate Jojo in an adventure-like fashion, viewing the hero from third-person perspective. You can call up a menu at any time to choose a command such as "Look", "Talk", etc. Being a Japanese adventure, the game doesn't contain puzzles. from time to time, you'll be attacked by enemies and will fight them in turn-based combat viewed from first-person perspective. Jojo and his party members possess the so-called "stands", super-powerful creatures you summon during fights. before each fight, you'll have to choose one of fice available tarot cards to determine the amount of luck and compatibility of the stands you'll have in the game.</desc>

	<desc>Jutei Senki is a turn-based strategy game, never released outside of Japan. The game takes place in an alternate universe where centuries ago humanity and their tree soldiers called Junei fight against Letum, a race of robots powered by magic.

The player commands the human army. The mission in each battle is to defeat the enemy army or take their headquarters in a limited amount of turns. In the human army's main building, the player can recruit new soldiers, but their number is limited. Each unit has its own statistics, including range, speed and attack power. Battles are carried out automatically, with animations on a separate screen.

There are three mission modes which include Campaign, Tutorial, and Expert modes and there is also a two-player versus mode.</desc>

	<desc>Kikou Keisatsu Metal Jack is a scrolling brawler based on the anime of the same name. At the start of the game the player can choose from Red Jack, Silver Jack, or Blue Jack. Red and Silver both have weapons they can find ammo for in levels (a gun and baton, respectively), and all three can do a multiple hit combo or a jumping attack. At the end of a level the Jack will be met by his vehicle which will then merge with his armor. In this form the Jack's attacks are strengthened and he can charge up an attack that hits every enemy onscreen.

There is no story told at any point in the game, so if you want to know what's going on you'll have to track down the anime.</desc>

	<name>Kishin Douji ZENKI: Battle Raiden</name>
	<desc>Once already Chiaki and her reluctant demon servant Zenki have saved the world from the forces of darkness, but apparently once is never enough. Chiaki has a vision of five cloaked figures and knows that only she and Zenki can stop them. At once they set off to track down the demon leaders.

In Kishin Douji ZENKI: Battle Raiden the player takes the role of Zenki. At first, and occasionally through the game, Zenki will be in his powered down form where he can only punch, jump, and dash. After Chiaki recovers her bracelet, or regains her concentration, or whatever she needs to do at the time, she can transform Zenki into his powered up form. In this form Zenki deals more damage and has a much longer list of attacks that get added to as the game progresses, such as a pillar of energy, an electrified punch, and a dashing attack. By picking up scrolls Zenki can do a powerful Rudora attack to all enemies on screen, but this attack damages Zenki as well.

To complete platforming levels Zenki will have to make it to the end of the level while occasionally finding hidden stone monuments that, when destroyed, will drop items as well as alter the level or remove obstacles, allowing Zenki to pass. After a stage's first platforming level is a midboss fight, and after the second platforming level is the boss fight proper.</desc>

	<name>Kouryuu Densetsu Villgust - Kieta Shoujo</name>
	<desc>This game is based on the animé series Villgust. The main hero of the game is Shun, a teenager who lives in modern-day Japan. One day, when he was going back from school with his girlfriend Michiko, Shun noticed a strange red-eyed rabbit. When he tried to follow him, Shun suddenly found himself all alone in a forest clearing. He was immediately approached by a group of four adventurers who said they were members of a group called R.A.G.E. (Resistance Against God of Evil). Apparently, Shun was transported into a parallel medieval world, and an evil organization known as Vile was the one behind Michiko's kidnapping. Shun and his friends will now do anything to help Michiko and to destroy Vile!

This is a traditional console-style RPG. You travel on the world map, visit towns, buy equipment and items, descend into dungeons, and fight random enemies in turn-based combat viewed from a third-person "over-the-shoulder" perspective. The party can hold up to five characters. The characters level up in a standard way, and also get experience and new levels for their magical spells.

	<name>Kunio no Oden</name>
	<desc>Another tournament rocks the streets around the Nekketsu High area, and you know Kunio and his gang aren't going to let an opportunity to prove how baddass they are pass them by.

The tournament this time is an eating contest, and the game itself plays like a block-lining puzzle game in the grand tradition of Tetris and Puyo Puyo. You must line-up blocks of the same type as they fall in the classic rectangular play area, clearing them before time runs up or they fill the entire screen. Features a 1P tournament mode, and a 2P competitive Vs mode in which you can chain blocks and send them to your opponent as "attacks" in hopes of causing him/her to lose.</desc>

	<name>Kunio-kun no Dodge Ball da yo: Zenin Shgo</name>
	<desc>16-bit sequel to the cult-classic Super Dodge Ball which unfortunately only saw a Japanese release.

The game continues the "Worldwide Dodge Ball tournament" motif of the original in which several teams from around the world compete in side scrolling dodge ball matches to see which one is the best. Gameplay is similar to other sport games in which you control the character that has the ball at the time (although a lead character always marks the formations and generally controls the team), and special moves can be executed to try and eliminate your opponents (such as homing throws and other esoteric moves). 

This sequel also adds more comprehensive tournament mechanics, for instance your performance in each match allows you to buy power-ups and special moves to enhance your players, you can also create a custom team and manage them throughout the tournament by adding or removing members as you see fit (you can even try to lure players from opposing teams). You can also choose among a series of formations and AI profiles in case you play alone, although you can use a multi-tap to play with up to 4 players.

Available game modes include Tournament, Vs and Mechabutsuke mode which is a variation on Vs that involves a free-roaming court and no outfielders.</desc>

	<desc>You are a boy named Gulliver, who lives together with his two best friends - the girl Misty and the young inventor Edison - in Venice, Italy. The evil Prince of Spain, Judou, is after the mysterious Blue Crystals who grant immense power to those who possess them. Gulliver's father was apparently connected to the secret of the Crystals, and was mercilessly killed by Judou. Now Gulliver swears revenge and embarks, together with Misty and Edison, on a grand journey that will take him to several cities and countries all over the world, from Rome to Himalaya.

The game is an action RPG in which you can switch characters. Each one of the three heroes has his/her own attacks: Gulliver is a melee-style fighter, Edison can throw expendable bombs at enemies, and Misty can attack with magical spells. Whenever you switch to a different characters, the inactive characters in your party gradually regain their hit points. There are no weapons and armor to buy or to find in the game, but the character level up and become stronger from defeating enemies, and collect items those enemies drop.

	<name>Laplace no Ma</name>
	<desc>1924, the town Newcam, Massachusetts. On the outskirts of the town stands the Weathertop mansion. It was just an ordinary place until the last owner, Benedict Weathertop, started practicing black magic. He killed his parents and populated the mansion with all kinds of undead. Since then, nobody dared to approach the mansion. But a short while ago, two boys were found dead near this horrible place. Apparently, the boys had tried to enter the mansion. Another evidence pointed out that a girl followed them - but her body hasn't been found yet, and there is a slight hope she might be alive. 
This is where you, the hero of the game, decide to investigate the mystery, and to venture into the mansion...

"Devil of Laplace" is a hybrid between survival horror and traditional Japanese RPG, similar to the pioneer of this genre, Sweet Home for NES. Unlike "Sweet Home", this game has less puzzles and is more oriented towards RPG elements. You are not stuck in the mansion, but can leave it, visit the town, and buy supplies. Later you also visit other locations such as a castle, etc. The battles are random, turn-based, and are viewed from first-person perspective. The hero of the game can recruit three other characters to the party of five available. Each character (including the hero, to whom you assign gender and class) belongs to one of the five character classes: Dilettante, Medium, Detective, Scientist, or Journalist. Dilettante is an all-around character with defensive magic, Medium is a kind of a black mage, Detective is a melee fighter, Scientist can construct powerful machines to perform various techniques, and the Journalist can take pictures of the monsters, which is the only way to gain money in the game.</desc>

	<name>Lennus II: Fin no Shito</name>
	<desc>This is a follow-up to the game "Lennus", which is know outside of Japan as  Paladin's Quest. The game is set in a world of Andell - a floating continent where ancient prophecies and highly advanced technology co-exist. A curse has fallen onto Andell - its four island, once united, are now separated, and are floating away from the heart of the continent, the temple of Andell. The sages of the temple summon a great hero named Farse, who must find a special magic orb for each one of the islands, which is the only way to re-unite them. Farse embarks on his journey, aided by three Terranos, the big-eared inhabitants of Andell.

This is a console-style RPG where you control a party containing the main hero Farse and three Terranos you select out of the available five. You encounter random enemies and bosses and fight them in turn-based combat viewed from first-person perspective. You can use special attacks and magical spells, which don't consume magic points, but take away a certain amount of your hit points. Instead of healing items, you have mini-bottles you can refill with potions in special places in towns. You can equip various magical artifacts which will allow you to use magic spells belonging to eight different elements.</desc>

	<name>Little Magic</name>
	<desc>May is an apprentice mage at Magic School and must pass the final exam.

A puzzle game seen from a top-down perspective. The goal of each level is to open the exit by pushing a magic stone on a designated spot. May can also push objects one tile ahead without moving herself. This is often used to get the stone over water that she can't cross herself. May's other ability is to create magic bubbles. She can create bubbles in three different sizes. Bubbles will pop after a certain amount of time, depending on their size. If they pop while next to the stone or another bubble, the stone or bubble will be moved one space. Since May can create several bubbles simultaneously, it is possible, and often necessary, to create chain reactions to maneuver the stone into the desired position.

As the game progresses, levels become increasingly difficult and new hazards and enemies are introduced. Enemies follow a set movement pattern and can sometimes be stopped, but not destroyed by magic bubbles. Later levels are made more complicated by different types of tiles including: grass that slows down May, ice that May and the magic stone will slip over, spikes that destroy the stone if it is pushed into them, collapsing tiles that can only be walked over once, rune tiles on which May cannot create magic bubbles, teleporters and others.</desc>

	<desc>In "Live a Live", you control seven main characters and play through seven different stories set in seven different time periods: prehistoric age, medieval Europe, feudal Japan, a futuristic world with robots and weird machines, etc. Those stories appear to have no common points, yet after completing all of them, you'll see they are in fact connected - the worlds of all those characters are threatened by the same ultimate evil force.

The combat features many innovations compared to traditional console RPGs: your position on the battle field is important, and certain techniques can be used only from certain positions, and enemy attacks also affect only specific parts of the field. Out of the seven chapters, some have more battle-oriented gameplay, while others are more devoted to puzzle-solving and information-gathering.

The game is one of the least known Squaresoft products, and was never released outside of Japan.</desc>

	<desc>All the king's candy has been stolen by invaders who live down in the dungeon. The king summons twin heroes: Justy and Liberty to try to get it back.

Lode Runner Twin: Justy to Liberty no Daibouken is a side-scrolling platform game, adapted for the SNES from the original Lode Runner. However the atmosphere has changed to a lot more cartoonish and happy. Controlling either Justy or Liberty, the player is able to move back and forth, climb ladders, cross ropes and dig holes in some types of surface. The enemies then fall into these holes and the player can walk over them. The goal in each level is to get all the candy.

There is also a battle mode that puts Justy versus Liberty to see who can fetch the most candy.

	<desc>The game is set in the same universe and shares characters and storyline with  Puyo Puyo puzzle games. Unlike Puyo Puyo, Mado Monogatari is a Japanese-style RPG. You play Arle, a five-year old apprentice magician. She is attending a special kindergarten, and it is time for the Final Exam. At the same time, Arle receives a mysterious letter that tells her that if she finds eight magical gems and takes them to the Wizard Mountain, she'll be granted one wish. Arle decides to search for the gems which are scattered all over the world, and to overcome all the obstacles with her great magic power!

The game features random enemy encounters and turn-based combat, which takes place on a platform (Arle to the left, the enemies to the right). You can't perform physical attacks at all, and your only way of harming enemies is through magic. During the game, you learn a variety of magic spells, which can be upgraded later. In battles you can't see your own and the enemies' hit points, and have to act according to your intuition.

And those Magic Knights are three young girls from Earth. Hikaru Shidou, Umi Ryuuzaki, and Fuu Hououjii have been plucked from modern-day Tokyo and brought to Cephiro by Emauraude, and they're the only ones who can defeat Zagato...as the Magic Knights!

This interpretation of the manga story is a traditional Japanese-style RPG. The player controls the three main heroines as a party; each one uses different weapons and learns various skills. Typically for the genre, the party roams the top-down world, visits towns, descends into dungeons, chats with non-playable characters, and fights randomly appearing enemies in turn-based style.</desc>

	<desc>Abel's daughter has been kidnapped by his former friend, Bayer.  Bayer has sold his soul to the devil, and sacrificed Abel's wife, in an attempt to resurrect the King of Demons.  With no other choice, Abel vows to save his daughter, no matter what the cost - even if it is his own humanity...

Majyuuou is a side-scrolling platformer for the Super Nintendo, taking influences from Castlevania and Contra. You play as Abel, intent on rescuing his daughter from the depths of Hell. As you defeat certain bosses, they will drop large, color changing gems. Pick up the gem, and you'll transform into either a red Harpy, a blue Dragon, or a green Lizard, depending on what color it is when you pick it up. Each demon type has its own special attacks.</desc>

Peach and Yoshi should have been together with Luigi......but alas, the visage of Luigi was missing. Mario's group of three have separated to find lost little Luigi.

At once, the suspicious sound of an engine was in the air. I wonder what it could be? It was Wario riding his personal plane, the Bulldog, and it dropped a bucket from the sky.

"Whew, woosh!"

And suddenly, the bucket was a snug fit on Mario's head.

"Uwagh, I can't see in this thing!"

The sprite of the woods, Wanda, witnessed it. The petite pixie did not have the strength to remove the bucket on her own, but she desired to help somehow. Thus, Wanda sends Mario a signal with her magic wand, determined to reunite him with Luigi......</desc>

	<desc>Dr. Hell's robot army has destroyed Tokyo, and now only Kouji Kabuto, and the giant robot Mazinger Z, can stop them from taking over the entire world. Animated cutscenes between levels tell the story of the game.

The Mazinger Z comes with a full armory of anti-robot weaponry, from super-powered karate moves to missiles, Breast Fire, and its signature Rocket Punch. Special moves deplete a regenerating energy meter, while Rocket Punches can be preformed at any time, although Mazinger will be unable to punch until its arms return. Each level contains several varieties of enemies, all of them from the show and unique to each level, that must be defeated to progress. Some enemy robots will fire projectiles from a distance while others will rush in attempt to grapple the Mazinger, and sometimes more than one enemy must be fought at once. Enemies will drop healing items and occasionally an item that upgrades Mazinger's Rocket Punch to the Iron Cutter for a limited time. At the end of each level is a fight with a stronger boss robot with more dangerous attacks.</desc>

	<desc>This is a remake of the game Metal Max, originally for NES. You are a little boy who lives with his father in a town in a futuristic world dominated by machines. Your wish is to become a "hunter" - to kill monsters that roam the world and to receive rewards for that. The storyline and the gameplay basics remained unchanged in this remake. You fight enemies in turn-based combat, and use vehicles, such as your own personal tank Mosquito, to transport yourself through different areas, and to participate in battles. You can also buy equipment and upgrade your vehicles.

The remake features enhanced graphics and sound, background pictures for battles (they were black in the original), slightly different locations (more houses in towns, sometimes different layout of the towns and of the world map), and reduced difficulty level.</desc>

Miracle Girls is based on the characters of the manga and anime of the same name. The player starts the game by picking either Tomomi or Mikage, although they both have the same abilities. Either can jump or toss candy, which will render enemies harmless for a few seconds as they eat it. Enemies incapacitated in this way can be used as platforms. Hidden in levels are bombs that fill the screen with candy, turning any onscreen enemies into heart rings, fruit that increase health, and doors that lead to a celestial slot machine that can reward additional lives. At the end of each level is a different challenge with a boss, such as a top-down squirt-gun fight or a game of matching cards.</desc>

	<name>Monstania</name>
	<desc>The hero of the game is Fron, a sixteen-year old boy who lives on the island of Monstania. One day, strolling in the forest, he notices a strange light. The light lead him to a clearing, and then suddenly disappeared. But Fron realized what was the meaning of that light - it was a fairy! Of course, everybody knew that fairies had been long extinct, but Fron never believed in that. All his life he wanted to meet a real fairy, and now, when the opportunity has come, he firmly decides to find her. His girlfriend Tia helps him on the dangerous journey, during which they meet a mysterious little girl named Chitta, and get involved in a grand adventure, that will ultimately lead them to the battle against the dark force that threatens the whole Monstania!

"Monstania" has a somewhat unusual gameplay within the frames of console RPGs. You don't explore the world in the game: it is entirely linear and takes you to the next destination by itself (only at a few points you can choose where to go next by selecting an appropriate answer). Once within the location, you cannot leave it until you complete all your objectives there, which then take you to the next location. The objective is usually a large strategic battle. You navigate your party members on the battle field, attack with melee and long-ranged weapons, and use special technique which require action points. Unlike most other turn-based strategy games, an enemy makes a move immediately after you did the same with one of your characters, without waiting for the "enemy turn". The RPG element is not very significant: your characters level up automatically after each battle. There are also some puzzles to solve in certain locations.</desc>

	<name>Mystic Ark</name>
	<desc>Seven heroes from seven different Worlds. Seven heroes who were brought to a mysterious temple on a remote island and transformed into statues. Seven heroes who are chosen to bring harmony back to the universe: Miriene the witch (wizard), Lux the tetsujin (a race of iron people), Reeshina the grappler (monk), Tokio the ninja, Kamio the ogre, and Mesia the priestess. The seventh hero is you, the protagonist of the game - the knight Remeer or the female warrior Ferris. Your first task will be to release your companions from the statues they are locked in. You must travel to the Cat World and to retrieve an important artifact. But your main objective is to visit all the seven Worlds and to find seven mystic arks - the items that will re-unite those Worlds and bring peace to them.

"Mystic Ark" is a RPG closely connected to 7th Saga. You travel on overworld map, visit towns, buy equipment, and descend into dungeons. The combat is turn-based and viewed from a third-person "over-the-shoulder" perspective. The battles are not random: the enemies can be seen as white dots on your radar, and if you don't want to fight, you can sometimes outrun or avoid them. The game also contains elements of pure adventure: often you must investigate objects closely and use items from your inventory on them.</desc>

	<name>Nekketsu Tairiku: Burning Heroes</name>
	<desc>The young fighter Ryu was thrown out of his father's home, and this childhood trauma has been dominating his life ever since. His only wish is to surpass his father and to show him he has become a better fighter than him. Laila is a cheerful treasure hunter. She dreams only of valuable things, adventure, travels, and life in the capital city.  Gaou is experiencing a personal tragedy: he wants to discover the mystery of the disappearance of a woman he loved, Asuka, aided by his best friend Froz. Naaga is a girl who wears a heavy armor, which - as she thinks - will prevent her from losing any battle. At present, she has problems since she owes a million gold pieces to her guild. What do those heroes have in common? As their ways cross, they will find out they are in fact pursuing one and the same goal...

"Burning Heroes" lets you start as either one of the four characters. Each one starts in a different place and is seemingly absorbed in his/her personal quest, but as the game progresses, the four heroes meet each other. You should also find and "unlock" four other playable characters as you advance in the game. The gameplay system of "Burning Heroes" is similar to other console-style RPGs: you fight random enemies and bosses in turn-based combat, viewed from third-person perspective, like in Final Fantasy games. As you get hit in a battle, your "passion" (literally "hot blood", nekketsu in Japanese) level rises, and the more damage you take, the quicker you reach 100%. Once the passion bar is full, you can summon a powerful monster and to unleash a devastating attack on the entire enemy party.</desc>

	<name>Neugier: Umi to Kaze no Kodo</name>
	<desc>You play a man named Duke, the son of Count Wein of Neugier. Long time ago, Duke was exiled from the country by his father. Traveling in faraway lands, Duke heard that his homeland was under attack. He decided to return to Neugier. On the way his ship was attacked by pirates, lead by a mysterious demon named Ord. After he barely escaped the ship, Duke found his way into his father's castle. He realized now that the pirates' attack and the monsters roaming the castle are connected. Although his father doesn't trust him, Duke is determined to save Neugier.

"Neugier" is an action adventure game in which you fight enemies in real-time, slashing them with your melee weapon. You have a "throw chain" ability, which allows you to press objects to the walls, destroying them. You can also push enemies to the walls this way. Duke can also jump and equip armor you find sometimes in dungeons.

	<name>Ou-chan no Oekaki Logic</name>
	<desc>Ou-chan no Oekaki Logic is a digital conversion, with anime mascots, of the classic Japanese newspaper puzzle nonograms. A nonogram is a puzzle on a square or rectangular grid the object of which is to reveal a hidden picture. Along each row and column there is a number or series of numbers which indicate how many squares will be colored in that row or grid. Example; &amp;quot;5 9 4&amp;quot; would mean there would be sets of five, nine, and four colored squares in the grid, in that order, with at least one blank in between. 

Ou-chan no Oekaki Logic adds a story mode where Ou-Chan, representing the player, competes with other blobby anime characters in finding hidden images in the nonogram grids.</desc>

	<name>Tetris Attack</name>
	<desc>All is not well on Yoshi's Island! The devious king Bowser has cast a spell on the island's inhabitants, turning them into his mindless slaves. Only Yoshi has escaped its effects, and so he must set off to free his friends, and to defeat Bowser and break the spell.

Tetris Attack is a fact-paced action puzzler featuring the colorful cast of characters from Yoshi's Island. A stack of blocks continually rises from the bottom of the screen, and the player controls a cursor which can swap any two blocks horizontally. Make a row or column of three or more and they'll clear, potentially creating combos from new blocks falling to take their place. Combos will send large garbage blocks to your opponent, which must be eliminated by clearing a piece that is touching it, turning it into normal blocks.

The game offers a story mode against the computer, as well as a 2-player versus mode, an endless mode, a timed mode where a certain number of blocks must be cleared, and a puzzle mode where a set arrangement of blocks must be cleared in a specific number of moves. The game is based on the Japan-only title Panel de Pon.</desc>

	<path>./Pipe Dream (Japan).fig</path>
	<name>Pipe Dream</name>
	<desc>Each level of this abstract puzzler challenges the player to set up a network of pipes to allow an unspecified substance known as 'flooz' to flow through as many of those as possible. The pieces are offered in random order, and there are seven different types - straight lines going horizontally or vertically, corners rotating in each of the four directions, and cross-over pieces which carry the flooz straight across horizontally and vertically. Each of these can be entered from either side. When the flooz hits a gap, or a piece which the previous piece can't flow into, the pipe is finished.

Before the flooz starts flowing from its randomly-selected starting position, the player has several seconds to start placing pieces. They can be put down anywhere. However a situation that can often occur is there will be a long and complex piping arrangement set up, yet a gap somewhere remains to be filled. Players are able to replace a piece with another in the same square (to make it easier to flow the flooz that way), but for a slight scoring penalty.

Bonuses are awarded for looping the flooz through both sides of at least 5 cross-over pieces, or passing the flooz through every square on the screen. Later levels have some squares on the grid blocked off, a few gaps in the side-wall (allowing flooz to thread to the other side of the screen). After every four levels there is a bonus game for points, in which the player can only place the pieces in the lowest open space in each column, similarly to the board game of "Connect 4".</desc>

	<name>Popful Mail</name>
	<desc>In this platform action game, you play as a cute bounty hunter known as Popful Mail. While you might think that a cute Anime chick would have no trouble making a living slashing bad guys with her sword, Popful is having a hard time making ends meet.  One day, however, Popful learns about a magician who has gone rogue and has a hefty bounty on his head. So, her adventure begins as Popful fights her way through a new adventure, and makes new friends along the way.

Primarily this is an action game with very slight RPG elements. As you make your way through the plethora of levels, you will have to collect money from slain foes. You use this money in the shops to buy weapons, armor, health, and so on. Also, this game features interaction with many, many characters through both on-screen dialog and fully animated sequences. Some of these characters become playable as you progress through the game.

This release has the same story and general gameplay style as the earlier version, but otherwise was made from scratch, having entirely different graphics, locations, enemies, challenges, etc.</desc>

	<path>./Ranma 1-2 - Akanekodan Teki Hihou (Japan) (Translated En).fig</path>
	<name>Ranma 1/2 : Hidden Treasure of the Crimson Cats</name>
	<desc>The game is based on the animÃ© series Ranma 1/2. It tells the story of the young martial artist Ranma Saotome. Traveling with his father Genma across China, Ranma discovered a cursed spring. When he and his father fell into that spring, they were both transformed: Ranma into a little girl, Genma into a panda bear. Hot water restored them to their original appearance, but whenever they are splashed with cold water, they turn into their "cursed" forms. 

The story of the game begins as Ranma and Genma are having breakfast by their friends. Suddenly, several cat-like creatures burst in and kidnap Genma. Ranma finds out that the cats belonged to Akaneko (Crimson Cat) Gang, who kidnaps strong fighters for some reason. Soon Ranma discovers that Kamusaru, the leader of the Crimson Cat Gang, is looking for an ancient treasure that will allow him to turn into a Nekomaou (Cat Demon King), and take over the world. Ranma and his friends will do anything to rescue Genma and to stop Kamusaru's evil plans!

The game features many characters from the animÃ©, including Ranma's fiancee Akane, the fighter Ryouga, the amazon warrior Shampoo who is in love with Ranma, and others. The game is built like a traditional Japanese RPG: your party fights random enemies in turn-based combat viewed from a third-person, Final Fantasy-like perspective. In battles, you can attack physically, or use various offensive and defensive techniques, which consume "ki" (an equivalent of magic points). Not only Ranma and Genma, but also the other characters in your parties can take a different shape. You carry around a bucket of cold water, and every time you use it on one of your characters, he/she is transformed into a "cursed" form. This is sometimes required to advance the story of the game (for example, Ranma can enter a certain location only as a girl).

	<name>Ranma 1/2 : Hard Battle</name>
	<desc>Another fighting game based on the Ranma 1/2 manga series set around the misadventures of a martial artist that gets cursed and magically transforms into a female version of himself whenever he's splashed with water.

As in previous games the premise simply involves the cast of the series going at each other's throats for ultimate supremacy, although this time you can select any character in either the single player or Vs gameplay modes.

The gameplay itself involves controlling your character in a side-scrolling arena and trying to defeat your opponent either with your basic attacks, special moves (triggered by specific controller motions) or super moves that require you to charge buttons and can only be dealt under specific situations (ie, when your life-bar starts flashing), while avoiding your opponent's attacks in turn.

	<name>Ranma 1/2 : Chougi Ranbu Hen</name>
	<desc>A 2D one-on-one fighting game based on the Ranma 1/2 manga series dealing with the adventures of a male martial artist cursed to transform into a female version of himself when splashed with water.

Ranma 1/2 : Chougi Ranbu Hen pits 12 characters from the series (including the male and female versions of Ranma) against each other in best 2-out-of-3 rounds matches, with the goal being to defeat all the opponents and thus claim a magical lucky cat that will grant the champion whatever he wishes.

Gameplay involves controlling your character in a 2D scrolling arena, in which you attempt to defeat your opponent by using your basic attacks and special moves, all the while avoiding your opponent's strikes. You can also charge up your character until he reaches "super" mode, which allows you to unleash super moves for extra damage, but performing any basic attack negates the super mode.

Features the standard single player and Vs modes along with a Tag Team Vs mode in which two players select a pair of characters and can exchange them in mid-fight for strategic advantage.</desc>

	<name>Ranma 1/2 : Ougi Jaanken</name>
	<desc>The game involves falling blocks of hands displaying the rock, paper, and scissors signs, which fall three at a time. In a similar manner to Tetris, the player can rotate the blocks to stack them, using pieces that defeat other pieces (e.g. paper over rock) to eliminate stacks. Doing so adds garbage pieces onto the opponent's screen to make it more difficult for them to eliminate their stacks of blocks. The objective is to fill up the opponent's screen up with blocks so that additional ones can no longer fit. Each character has two special attacks which can be used when large combinations are completed. Once in each round each player can also use a bucket of water that can transform a cursed character into their alternate form, which weakens their attacks until the effect wears off. This does not affect Akane or the Gambling King.</desc>

	<desc>Multidirectionally scrolling action shooter. The main character runs through science fiction scenarios blasting away everything that moves. Starting with only a single shot,  5 different upgradable weapon systems can be collected as extras. Upon death, the last activated system loses one increment of its current upgrade status, but can be refueled by additional extras collected. Every weapon has also a massive 'smart' bomb feature, wiping out mostly everything on screen at once if invoked. There are also some R-Type style space shooter levels thrown in for good measurement. Very arcady with tons of action. Several boss monsters per level. Level progress is saved via password feature.

But remember, Dr. Wily is mad, but he's not stupid. He had a backup plan...and all he had to do was just wait...

6 months had passed, and somewhere from deep within Wily's abandoned lab, 4 hidden capsules activated and opened. His backup plan was in action...he had hidden 4 new Wily Robots that would spring him out of jail so he could continue his mad reign.

When Mega Man hears the word that Wily was busting out of prison, he rushes onto the scene, only to encounter a strange robot he had never seen before named Bass. Bass tells Mega Man to back off, that he would stop Wily, and that Mega Man was no longer needed.

Think that's gonna stop Mega Man? No way! Mega Man takes off to put a stop to Dr. Wily and find out exactly whose side Bass is on...</desc>

	<path>./Romancing SaGa (Japan) [En by Trans Dimension v0.40] (Incomplete).fig</path>
	<name>Romancing SaGa</name>
	<desc>Once upon a time, three evil gods fought against the holy gods, and the holy God-Father chose a human warrior to help them. Finally, after a prolonged, terrible war, the leader of the three evil gods - Death, the eldest of them - surrendered. The youngest evil god, Schirach, became a human and has lost her powers. The middle one, Saruin, was sealed away in the dark world. Now, after thousand years have passed, and the seal of Saruin has weakened, it is time for you, the hero of the new generation, to defeat him.

Romancing SaGa is the fourth installment in the long SaGa series - non-linear role-playing games with several main heroes. It is the first of three Super Nintendo entries. The first three games in the series were on the Gameboy and were known as "Final Fantasy Legend" outside of Japan. In this game, you play the stories of eight characters, which will later unite to face the ultimate evil. The eight characters belong to different classes and have different abilities. There are four male characters (noble son, thief, adventurer, and pirate), and four female ones (nomad, ranger, dancer, and savage). The combat is turn-based, with enemies visible on screen. Taking a cue from Final Fantasy II on the NES, instead of "Leveling" your character as a whole you level specific abilities such as a type of weapon or magic, as well as, stats such as HP and Strength and Intelligence. New to this entry abilities are randomly unlocked during battle as a light-bulb appears over the characters head and the new ability is unleashed to the surprise of friend and foe. This serendipitous element of gameplay along with the multiple heroes to choose from greatly enhance the replay value as no two playthroughs are alike. Which is good considering the steep learning curve of the SaGa games which require multiple playthroughs to truly master the system.

"Romancing SaGa" was never released outside of Japan until the Playstation 2 remake "Romancing SaGa: Minstrel Song"</desc>

	<desc>Every 300 years the Death Eclipse kills all newly born creatures. Men, women, and children, animals and plants, even ferocious monsters - no one can survive the devastation caused by the Eclipse. No one except a child chosen by the destiny. 600 years ago, such a child survived the Death Eclipse, only to become a demon king. During the next Eclipse, a chosen child became a holy king, and he defeated the evil demon king. Now, when the next Eclipse is nearing, nobody knows who the next fortunate survivor will become - a demon or a holy man?

In "Romancing SaGa 3", you can play through the story controling any one of the eight main characters - Julian, Monica, Mikhael, Harid, Katarina, Thomas, Elena, and Sarah. The story is common for all eight characters, and they often join together and share the same piece of a story. The princess Monica learns about a rebellion planned by a treacherous Baron to dethrone her brother, Marquis Mikhael. She goes to warn him, but on her way, she loses her horse, and has to stop in an inn of the town Shinnon. There, she meets travelers who agree to lend her a horse and accompany her to see her brother. When they finally reach Mikhael, a war begins...

"Romancing SaGa 3" has a refined upgrading system: you can upgrade your weapons and your spells by using them continuously. The party combat is turn-based, and there are also strategic army-vs.-army battles you'll have to command.</desc>

	<name>Rudra no Hihou</name>
	<desc>The Earth is ruled by heavenly powers, who destroy it and create it again every 4000 years, to end the live of powerful races and to let new ones appear. Many years ago, four great races dominated the Earth: the wise Danans, the beautiful Mermaids, the proud Reptiles, and the strong Giants. But those races had to give place to a newly born race: the humans. During the era of the humans, the planet's air has become filled with smog and the water dirty with pollutants. The cult of the Rudra have appeared and begun fortelling the end of the world. As the 4000 year deadline approaches, three characters each embark on their separate yet intertwined quests.

Sion is a young warrior who wants to take part in a ritual tournament and become the strongest of the kingdom. However a capture of one of the Cultists of Rudras soon complicates his training.

Surlet is a wise magician who is interested in archeology and history of the Earth. He is also a pupil of the famous professor Muench who recently made a very important discovery regarding ancient ruins

Riza is a young druid who lives with her grandfather in a quiet village. She was born with a mysterious jade on her forehead, and now feels the urge to save the world from an inevitable, yet unknown disaster.

Rundra no Hiho is a turn-based RPG, similar in gameplay and graphics to the better known Final Fantasy VI. Whenever players load the game cartridge, they are able to choose which of the three characters they wish to play. This allows any one of these quests to be saved and put aside for any amount of time, allowing the player to change between characters as they so desire. Regardless of which character is chosen, the game is displayed as a top-view on the overworld and in towns. Players can move around to different locations, search treasure chests and talk to townspeople. On the overworld and in dungeons, random encounters can occur. During battles the game is displayed from a side-view and is turn-based between the player's characters and monsters. Players are able to Fight with their weapon, use mantras (magic), use items, defend or run away. Defeat of monsters will result in the party earning experience points and money, which can be spent to buy new weapons, armor and items.

The game's mantra (magic) system is unique in that all spells are formed up of syllables, each with it's own effect (for instance, the syllable "Ig" represents fire and the syllable "ga" augments any mantra's power over it's basic form. Therefore "Igga" is a more powerful version than "Ig" alone). Syllables must be arranged in proper combinations in order to form effective magic spells. Hints towards some of these combinations can be found inside treasure chests or by talking to townspeople.

	<name>Art of Fighting 2</name>
	<desc>In this sequel to the original Art of Fighting, and prequel to the original Fatal Fury, we learn that Mr. Karate, the final boss of the original game, behind the mask, is really Takuma Sakazaki, Ryo and Yuri's father, that Takuma was being used by Geese Howard for his own evil intentions, and that Mr. Big was the one who had originally kidnapped Yuri.

Many of the problems that existed in the first game have been fixed in this installment (it is easier to execute special moves, you no longer have only Ryo or Robert to choose from in 1 player mode, etc.).

The entire cast from the first Art of Fighting is here (with the exceptions of Todo and Mr. Karate), along with a few new characters: Takuma Sakazaki, Ryo and Yuri's father; Yuri Sakazaki, Takuma's daughter and Ryo's sister; Eiji Kisaragi, a sworn enemy of the Sakazakis; Temjin, a Mongolian trucker; and a younger version of Geese Howard, whom you face as the last boss if you beat the game without losing a round.</desc>

	<path>./Seiken Densetsu 3 (Japan) (Translated En).fig</path>
	<name>Seiken Densetsu 3</name>
	<desc>Seiken Densetsu 3 is set in the same world as the two previous Seiken Densetsu games (the first is Final Fantasy Adventure, and the second is most known as Secret of Mana). The mysterious power of Mana is also the center of all events in Seiken Densetsu 3. Years have passed, and all the destructive powers of Mana have been securely sealed by Mana Swords into eight seeds, all placed in eight different kingdoms. But some people know about those sealed powers, and they don't want to free them for the sake of humanity, but for their own gain - such as the kingdom of Altena, which is slowly freezing and which can be saved only by the legendary powers.

The game features several plot lines connected to each other by their common background. In the beginning of the game, you are offered to choose a group of three among six different characters of different classes: Duran the Fighter, Angela the Magic User, Lisa the Amazon, Carlie the Cleric, Kevin the Grappler and Hawk the Thief. Each one of them has her/his own background story and dwells in a different land. Gradually, the connections between those different characters become apparent, and the seemingly loose story lines are connected into a whole.

Seiken Densetsu 3, like the previous game of the series, is an action RPG, with real time combat.</desc>

	<name>Sengoku Denshou</name>
	<desc>A 2D side-scrolling beat 'em up, Sengoku casts you and a friend as two renegade fighters out to beat the crap out of the many assorted gangs that threaten the post-apocalyptic cities of the future. Unfortunately for them they also get caught in a time-warping scheme caused by the evil Nobunaga who attempts to invade the time period with mythical warriors and evil creatures from the Japanese sengoku period.

The game thus takes you from the city to a spirit-realm from time to time, in which you must fight all sorts of Japanese mythical figures, and release three haunted spirits that can aid you in your battle. Collecting orbs from defeated enemies allows you heal up, gain weapons and even energy attacks and also summon the warrior forms of the spirits you released, which change your character's form and give you a new collection of attacks and powers.

	<name>Shin Megami Tensei</name>
	<desc>A young man lives together with his mother in Kichijoji, a district in modern Tokyo. One day, he has a strange dream: he is being sucked into another dimension, a strange maze-like structure. A spirit appears in front of him and asks him his name. As he proceeds further, he meets a man who is hanging on a cross, another one who is being tormented by a demon, and a mysterious young woman who is bathing in a pool...

"Wake up!" - the voice of his mother cuts through the dream. The young man wakes up and checks his computer. Suddenly, a message arrives: the world is headed towards destruction. Only he who can summon demons through a virtual space will be able to prevent a disaster. What could that mean? The young man goes outside and finds out a murder has occurred in the nearby park. The district must be cut off from the rest of the city until the murderer is found. This was the beginning of the demon summoner's story...

"Shin Megami Tensei" is a first-person RPG set in modern-day and futuristic Tokyo. The hero of the game can summon demons, who use a mysterious energy called Magnetite. The demons can fight for you and perform other useful tasks. The first-person combat is turn-based. In the beginning of the game, you can set the statistics of your party members, determining their strength, stamina, intelligence, etc. You'll need to make some crucial decisions during the game, that will also influence the outcome of its events.</desc>

	<name>Shin Megami Tensei II</name>
	<desc>Shin Megami Tensei II is a direct sequel to the  first game. The events of this game take place 20 or 30 years after the hero of the first game followed the neutral path, defeated the Asura Lord and the seraph Michael at the Cathedral, and founded a state where followers of both Law and Chaos ideals could live freely. But his reign of freedom doesn't last long. The Mesia faith gains power, expanding the Cathedral into a new enclosed environment named Millenium. The Gaians rise up, but their rebellion is repressed by the Mesians' elite warrior class, the Temple Knights. Some years later, a retired arena fighter Okamoto discovers a man fighting for his life against a demon. He rescues the man, who doesn't even remember his own name, and trains him to fight in the arena so they might both go on to a better living in one of the upper-class areas of Millenium. And thus the new battle for a better future begins...

"Shin Megami Tensei II" features all the gameplay innovations of the previous game. You can summon demons, fuse them, make them battle for you, talk to random enemies and receive information from them, etc. The combat is turn-based, and you explore the dungeons from a first-person perspective view.</desc>

	<name>Shin Nekketsu Kouha Kunio-kun: Kunio-tachi no Bank</name>
	<desc>Another beat 'em up in the Nekketsu Kouha Kunio-Kun series. 
The eternal rebel Kunio and his pal Riki finally get to face the long arm of the law when they get both arrested for killing a couple of bystanders in a hit-and-run incident. Problem is they are innocent and the lookalike killers are still out there! Kunio and his pal now have to break out of the prison and go kick some butt in the name of justice (and to clear their names of course).

Gameplay involves defeating all opponents using your arsenal of attacks and special moves (as well as any weapons you may find around) and completing the many side scrolling stages that make up the game, usually after beating an end level boss.

Kunio and Riki are not alone in their quest, as their hard boiled girlfriends, Misako and Kyouko, can join up and provide their unique collection of special moves to the mix. Biking sequences in which you try to get to another part of town while fending-off opponents Road Rash-style are also added for additional gameplay and the game uses several non-interactive cutscenes and dialogues to carry the plot forward.</desc>

	<name>Shounen Ashibe</name>
	<desc>Shounen Ashibe: Goma-chan no Yuuenchi Daibouken (lit: "Boy Ashibe: Goma-chan's Great Amusement Park Adventure") is a Super Famicom platformer from Nova Co. and Takara. The player alternates between controlling the human Ashibe, as he escorts his friends across a world map while talking to NPCs and following the game's story, and the seal Goma-chan in 2D platformer stages where he must track down eight items by investigating his surroundings thoroughly. While Goma-chan can't be hurt by enemies, colliding with them causes him to lose one of the eight items he's already found - as the stages have a strict time limit, it's best to avoid this situation whenever possible.

Shounen Ashibe was originally a Shounen Jump serialized manga before becoming an anime TV series in 1991, a year before this game was released.</desc>

	<desc>Shounen Ninja Sasuke ("Boy Ninja Sasuke") is a comedic brawler published by SunSoft exclusively for the Super Famicom. The player, as the eponymous ninja, must rescue the daughter of a local lord by fighting his way through hordes of masked bandits led by a mysterious warlord. A second player can join in as Sasuke's monk friend Chin-nan. The game has a distinct sense of speed and verticality, and it's recommended that the player(s) try running and jumping around performing aerial attacks rather than staying on the ground and getting quickly swarmed by enemies.The game was published by SunSoft and developed by an unknown developer, though Mint is thought to have contributed to its sound design. A US SNES localization, with the title Boy Ninja Sasuke, was briefly considered but then axed.</desc>

	<name>Slayers</name>
	<desc>"Slayers" is based on an manga series of the same name (also known as Lina the Teenage Sorceress). The heroine of the manga (and of the game) is Lina Inverse, a seventeen-year-old girl who can use magic and is also proficient with the sword. Lina particularly likes money, and often robs rich people and hunts for treasure. She also has a sense for justice - if a village or a town is in trouble, Lina will do anything to protect it and to fight the bad guys! In the game, Lina is knocked down after a fight against mysterious attackers, and is found by the inhabitants of the nearby village. The trouble is, she can't remember anything! When she meets her long-time companion Naga, their first objective become to investigate the goblin attacks on the population, but Lina's ultimate quest is to regain her memory and to find out who or what has attacked her.

The game is a traditional console-style RPG with towns, dungeons, random enemies, and turn-based combat viewed from first-person perspective, in a Dragon Warrior fashion. The characters can attack physically or use special attacks. Lina can also cast various magical spells. You cannot travel on the world map, but "jump" to various locations instead. The game features animé-style cut scenes.</desc>

	<desc>The game is a less of a self-contained game and more a collection of four smaller ones; including a point-and-click segment featuring Schroeder. The player controls Woodstock and direct Snoopy as he performs all sorts of errands for different Peanuts characters. The player does a separate game for each character; some of them require him to do a little detective work, or to direct Snoopy to win a race, or to get a character to some place. The ultimate goal in the game is to get everyone in shape for Snoopy's concert. Games can either be played using stereo or monoaural sound.

The music was composed by Hirokazu Tanaka (?????)[2] and Minako Hamano (??????),[2] in addition to arrangements of the familiar works of Vince Guaraldi known to longtime Peanuts fans. Many years later the game has been translated to English (by Aeon Genesis) and Portuguese.</desc>

The game is played from an isometric perspective from which you can get a good view of the mazes and Ebisumaru. You have no direct control of Ebisumaru per se, but instead switch special blocks around the mazes that can change Ebisumaru's direction of travel and such. You must reach the end of each stage before time runs out, and get all the power-ups and items laid in each maze in hopes of getting to Goemon alive.</desc>

They belong to respectable families of warriors and healers, and excel in battles kills. One day, a letter from a neighbor town arrives. A strange disease has plagued the town and its inhabitants plead the healers of Clatos to help them. Milly's father decides to go, but he himself catches the disease.

	<desc>The fourth addition to the Bomberman series for the SNES.  This game is almost identical to Super Bomberman 3 only with new levels and a new story.

A small twist in this game is that instead of choosing the traditional bomberman or a country specific character players get to choose between bosses from the previous game when playing battle mode. Each character has a special power from a jet pack to throwing abilities.</desc>

	<name>Super Fire Pro Wrestling - Queen's Special</name>
	<desc>Long before the WWE introduced the Divas wrestling matches, in Japan there was a more serious affair, where wrestling skill was more important than breast implants, and matches were "real" (as far as wrestling goes) instead of pillow-fighting or bra and panties fights.

In this game in the Fire Pro Series, the cast of the All Japan Women's Pro-Wrestling promotion are available, all fighting to win the Red belt, the highest prize of the federation. It's also possible to fight in single matches, tournaments, Battle Royal and Elimination matches. The usual array of options in CAW is present, being possible to create 16 new Wrestlers.

Gameplay, as usual is the series, is dramatically different than in most western games. Each wrestler has a bunch of moves, ranked from weak to strong. While it's possible to connect any of them from open situations, while grappling only when the opponent is already beaten the most powerful moves can be successfully used.

	<name>Super Fire Pro Wrestling Premium X</name>
	<desc>In this final appearance of Fire Pro series on 16-bit consoles, the usual roster of over 150 wrestlers from several wresting promotions worldwide including several styles from Shoot or Pancrase to American and Lucha are joined by 80 Create-a-wrestler slots, plus secret wrestlers such as legends Gotch or Thesz or the roster of Blazing Tornado. While all fighters have fictional names, a lot of them are perfectly recognizable by their attire, stance and style. The CAW mode allows the player to create a wrestler from scratch, setting how they look (choosing face, size, clothing and setting colours) and fight, with several styles and stances available, as well as over 500 moves, each more suitable for certain styles and skills. To make them fight more realistically when controlled by the AI, the CAW mode also allows one to set move priorities.

Five game modes are available, including World Championship (single and tag), Battle Royale, 5-man Elimination Mode, League Battle and the One Night Dream Match. There are several referees available (each with their own quirks) and variant rules, from allowing fighting outside the ring without count-out (or disallowing it) to the disabling of disqualifications from illegal moves.</desc>

	<path>./Super Nazo Puyo - Rulue no Roux (Japan).fig</path>
	<name>Super Nazo Puyo - Rulue no Roux</name>
	<desc>A spin-off of the successful action puzzle series Puyo Puyo with a twist. Whereas the main Puyo Puyo games are aimed at defeating AI or human controlled opponents in puzzle duels (where each player has his own play area in which color-coded "puyos" fall and must clear them out faster than his opponent). Nazo Puyo instead challenges the player with different single-player scenarios in which a specific objective must be completed (such as clearing only the red Puyos, or performing a specific sequence of combos, etc.).

The game uses the mold of a top-down RPG in which you control the young magician Arle as she explores towns and dungeons in her search for adventure. Each quest involves finding an NPC who will trigger one of the aforementioned scenarios and rewards Arle with experience points and unique items that increase her stats.

	<desc>Sequel to the original Super Nazo Puyo, SNP2 is a Puyo Puyo spin-off which combines arcade puzzle elements with RPG gameplay.

You play as the young magician Arle as she sets out looking for adventure all over the land, chatting with NPCs and exploring the game world via a standard top-down RPG interface. Quests involve careful exploration and solving Nazo Puyo challenges which involve specific scenarios of puzzle-based gameplay which the player must solve under a specific timeframe. These sequences give the player a play area in which color-coded "puyos" are pre-arranged in different patterns, and the player must position and arrange the ones that start to fall in order to fullfil the objective at hand (clear only a certain row or color of puyos, reach a certain number of combos, etc.). Additionally, running into specific monsters can trigger standard Puyo Puyo duels, in which both players have their own play areas and the objective is to clear the screen faster than the opponent.

As in the original, the game features a Competition (free tournament) or Conquest (clear each table in succession) modes, but the hotseat multiplayer component has been reduced to two-players. Graphics are 2D representations of the tables viewed from a tilted 3D view, which manages to fit the entire tables on the screen without scrolling.</desc>

	<desc>Super Sokoban (or Soukoban) is a puzzle game in which the player must push crates around a maze to their designated storage area, ensuring they do not accidentally push a crate into a position where it cannot be recovered. Thinking Rabbit created the original game in 1982 on home computers, and Super Sokoban is the first Super Famicom game to follow the same blueprint.

The intro establishes that the eponymous Sokoban, or warehouse worker, must perform enough box-pushing puzzles to earn enough cash for a flashy new car so that he might finally impress the girl of his dreams.

An added wrinkle is that each stage has a fixed move limit, and so the player must not only push the boxes in the right order but do so with maximum efficiency. The game was not released outside of Japan.</desc>

	<name>Super Tetris 2 + Bombliss</name>
	<desc>Super Tetris 2 + Bombliss is one of the many versions of the famous soviet puzzle game, the first one available for the Super Nintendo, and an updated version of Tetris 2 + Bombliss.

As the title would suggest, the game features both standard Tetris as well as another similar game called Bombliss. Tetris offers three game modes: standard marathon (A-type), start with garbage (B-type), and rising garbage (C-type). There is also a two-player versus mode where clearing rows sends garbage to the other player.

Bombliss is slightly different from normal Tetris. Arranged on the board and in some dropped pieces are bomb squares. Completing a row does not clear the blocks in the row, but will trigger any bombs in the row which will destroy blocks. Different sizes of bombs will generate larger explosions. Bombliss is offered in standard marathon mode, a puzzle mode where a set board must be cleared using set piece drops, and a 2-player versus mode.</desc>

	<name>Super Tetris 3</name>
	<desc>Super Tetris 3 is yet another version of the famous soviet puzzle game. However, despite what the title may suggest, contained within are actually four different versions of Tetris: Tetris Classic, Familiss, Sparkliss, and Magicaliss. Tetris Classic, of course, is the basic version of the game, which comes with an endless mode and a 25-line "standard" mode. Familiss, as the name might suggest, is a family mode for up to four players simultaneously. Sparkliss, meanwhile, is very similar to Bombliss from Super Tetris 2, only with a medieval fantasy theme and different explosion patterns. Sparkliss includes both a stage mode and a puzzle mode.

The most unique mode is Magicaliss, which has never shown up on any other version of Tetris. In Magicaliss, pieces come in three basic colors, and by rotating the piece, the player can choose between them. Creating a line entirely out of one color will clear all blocks on the screen of that color. There are also grey pieces, which can only be cleared by creating a line made entirely from one color, which will cause all grey blocks on screen to become that color. There are also rare rainbow pieces which will act as any color. Besides these additions, the game itself is basic Tetris.

Tetris Classic, Sparkliss, and Magicaliss can also be played in a two-player battle mode, besides the four-player Familiss mode.</desc>

	<name>Tales of Phantasia</name>
	<desc>In "Tales of Phantasia", you play a young boy named Cless, who lives together with his parents in a quiet village. It was a day like all the others when Cless decided to go hunting with his best friend Chester. Chasing a wild boar, Cless discovered a strange talking tree in the forest who was pleading him for help. But as soon as it stopped speaking, the two friends heard the sound of an alarm. They returned to the village and found it burnt down, and all its inhabitants murdered. Before Cless' mother died in his arms, she told him this terrible massacre had something to do with the pendant she and her husband gave Cless for his birthday... what connection could there be? Cless decides to visit his uncle who lives in another town, but he doesn't realize his journey will take him to much more remote places than that!

"Tales of Phantasia" presents a unique combat system: The battles have a lot in common with fighting games: you fight on a platform that slowly scrolls forward and have to attack your enemy in real time. Other party members are controlled by AI. You can pause the game at any time and use magic, items, or choose an overall strategy for your allies.</desc>

	<name>Tenchi Muyou ! Game-Hen</name>
	<desc>Sasami is kidnapped by a mysterious little girl with magical powers, and Tenchi and his companions must travel to rescue her, battling monsters and other creatures on the way.

Tenchi Muyou! Game-Hen is a strategy game with RPG elements, based on the popular Japanese Tenchi Muyo! cartoon series. The game moves from battle to battle, with the plot being revealed through cutscenes between them. The player fights the computer on turns, controlling the individuals from a party of four. The party members are selected on a separate screen before each battle, and as the game progresses new characters become available.

During the skirmish, selecting the characters brings up a menu with three command options: move, attack or end turn. A fourth transform option becomes available later, after they reach a higher level. When moving or attacking, glowing tiles on the ground show the maximum range of the action. Performing either one costs action points, shown as eight regenerating green dots on the status window, alongside basic statistics like health, defense and attack levels. Characters level up automatically while on the battlefield, increasing their abilities and receiving more powerful attacks. Health powers are also accessed through the attack menu, recovering lost points to an ailing comrade within their range. Characters can transform to a more powerful version when they have the ability to do so, and all the eight green dots are still available. The transformed unit has more powerful attacks and a wider range of movement.

After the battle, a map screen appears where the player can save the game, and choose the next battle from one of the available paths. It is possible to revisit battlegrounds, to level up before tackling stronger enemies.

	<name>Torneko no Daibouken - Fushigi no Dungeon</name>
	<desc>Torneko (aka Taloon) from Dragon Quest IV was a merchant and treasure hunter who always dreamed of owning his own shop. Having defeating the evil along with other heroes, he returned to Endor to work peacefully. Some time has passed and after growing successful in this town, Torneko grew anxious. Hearing rumors one day about a "Mysterious Dungeon", Torneko meets with the king to ask permission to set up a new shop, closer to this Mysterious Dungeon. By exploring this cavern and returning safely with the prizes, Torneko hopes to become the most successful merchant in the world.

Torneko No Daibouken is a overhead view game similar to Hack, what might be called a "dungeon crawl". Torneko must venture into the mysterious dungeon gathering treasure. He may equip any weapons and shields he finds there, as well as gather up items such as spell scrolls, staffs and herbs with a variety of effect. A variety of enemies, familiar to the Dragon Quest series, await him. If Torneko successfully exits the dungeon, he is able to sell any of the items he has collected. This money then goes to improve the quality of his shop and living quarters. As the game progresses, Torneko is able to store special items in the vault, which he is then able to bring with him on subsequent trips to the dungeon.</desc>

	<name>Treasure Hunter G</name>
	<desc>Brothers Red and Blue G. decide to leave their idyllic village in search of their long lost father, who left the kids years ago to go treasure hunting. Unfortunately, as soon as they begin their quest, they become entangled with a mysterious girl on the run from evil monsters who holds the key to the resurrection of a great demon. Now its up to the brothers to save the world if they ever want to find their father.

Treasure Hunter G is a top-down RPG in which you control your party of four characters as they explore the fantasy/sci-fi game world in search for quests and grinding their stats while the plot advances. The game is divided in a world-map screen, a top-down "town" mode and a turn-based fight mode in which the characters are taken to generic tiled top-down arenas in which they select each character and move or attack depending on their action points.

Enemies can be seen on the map instead of jumping at you at random intervals, and you can freely decide whether to engage them or simply circle them around. The game uses a combination of hand-drawn sprites and CGI pre-rendered one (mostly for the main characters) with a distinct cute or Super Deformed design (as usual for most console RPGs).</desc>

	<name>Uch no Kishi: Tekkaman Blade</name>
	<desc>Uchu no Kishi: Tekkaman Blade's is based on the anime Tekkaman Blade, also known as Teknoman. The game's levels are a mix of scrolling shooter and fighting game. The first part of every level is a scrolling shooter where Tekkaman Blade must survive several waves of Radam before killing two stronger boss-like Radam and meeting another Tekkaman. In scrolling shooter levels Blade can either toss his spear to defeat enemies at range or quickly slash with it to destroy bullets and enemies. One enemy type will drop different colored System Box powerups: green restores health, red destroys all enemies onscreen (except bosses), and blue turns Blade invulnerable and able to destroy all enemies upon contact (including bosses).

The end of every level is a one on one fight with an enemy Tekkaman. Each Tekkaman starts with a weapon, but the weapon will be lost if they take too much damage, forcing them to use punches and kicks. This mode can also be played in 2-player mode, where each player selects their Tekkaman.</desc>

	<desc>Ultra Seven is a 2D one-on-one fighting game that uses characters from the tokusatsu TV show of the same name. The Ultra Seven series is based on the original Ultraman TV show, but updated for a modern audience with a different protagonist who hails from the same planet as Ultraman.

Ultra Seven features a single-player story mode in which the player can sometimes choose which of Ultra Seven's capsule monsters (Agira, Micras or Windom) to fight as, and a versus mode in which two players can duke it out.</desc>

	<desc>Umihara Kawase is an unusual platformer featuring a girl that is captured in a bizarre dream world full of walking fish. Equipped with a fishing line she can swing and abseil from platform to platform using it as a grappling hook. The game's specialty is the detailed physics system that allows Kawase to perform various tricks using the elastic and length variable rope to move around the levels. There are almost 50 fields (levels) but most have multiple exits that allow you to play through the game on different paths without playing every single field in order. You can also record a good game and save it to watch it again at a later time.</desc>

	<path>./Wonder Project J - Kikai no Shounen Pino (Japan) (Translated En).fig</path>
	<name>Wonder project J</name>
	<desc>There was once a great scientist and inventor named Gepetto, who lived on an island farm together with his creations, his robotic helper, the pixie Tinker, and his pet animals. His greatest creation was an artificial boy named Pino. No, he was not carved from wood, but looked just like a real boy - only he could turn his head 360 degrees. But Gepetto was arrested for an unknown reason. The boy Pino looks like a real boy, but he was completed just a few moments ago, and he knows absolutely nothing. All he can do is wander aimlessly, poking objects and turning his head. It is up to you, the player, to make Pino a real man!

In this simulation/role-playing game, you must use the robotic pixie Tinker to educate Pino. You can move Tinker around, examining objects and collecting them in an adventure-like fashion. Pino will automatically follow you to the direction you are facing, but will continue walking until you stop him. He will also pick objects and make his own "experiments" with them. Your goal is to train PIno in various disciplines. His stats can be raised in a RPG style: reading books increases his intelligence, throwing a ball increases his dexterity, and so on. By praising or scolding Pino you will gradually make him understand what should be done and what not.

The "Yoshi" cookie is very special in both the 1-player and the 2-player game. Since the Yoshi Cookie is the key to both games, you must use it wisely.</desc>

	<desc>After having defeated the ultimate evil in his previous adventure, the great hero Adol stands on a sea shore, thinking about the fate of the once peaceful Utopian land of Ys, while the wind is blowing through his red hair. Suddenly, Adol notices a bottle, thrown onto the shore. It contains a letter, written in a foreign language, in which an unknown person asks Adol to come to his land and save it from a mysterious evil. Adol decides to accept the offer, and thus his adventure begins again...

Ys IV: Mask of the Sun is an action RPG with a combat system like the earlier Ys games. An enemy should be rammed from the sides in order to hurt him. If performed incorrectly, the player will get hurt himself. It's also possible to use magic and position oneself strategically in battle so that the enemy won't be able to inflict any damage.

The game is a series of set-piece battles where two opponents build up gauges using the D-pad and one of the face buttons: each combination leads to a separate attack and requires a different amount of build-up. The player can go through the story mode, which recounts events from the manga, or they can play a "free" mode against opponents of their choice.</desc>

The game casts you as a wrestler of your choice in the official Zen Nippon Pro Wrestling league and pits you against the other featured wrestlers in grappling matches. As in the original you get to pick between several game modes including: Tournament, Championship (single or tag) Vs, Team (with the new 4-player variant) and Training.</desc>

	<name>Zero 4 Champ RR</name>
	<desc>Zero4 Champ RR is a 1994 racing video game developed by Media Rings for the Super Famicom, about an 18-year-old race car driver who must chase his dreams of drag racing after being turned down for university (and becoming a r?nin due to his joblessness status).

Because the game takes place in the "near future" and it was released in the mid-1990s, the game itself is referring the story of the game to the first decade of the 21st century.

This game received a sequel in the form of Zero4 Champ RR-Z.</desc>

	<name>Acrobat Mission</name>
	<desc>Years ago humanity abandoned the over-polluted Earth to make a new home on Mars. Now, without warning, a mechanical moon has appeared in the skies over Mars, and is raining down destruction on the colonies. A plan is hastily put into action to destroy the moon and its armada of space-craft. Due to the impossible task of surviving a direct assault, the mission is code-named Acrobat Mission.

Your spaceship in Acrobat Mission is capable of firing a single straight ahead shot. By picking up a Wide upgrade, more shots are added that fly off at an angle, and the shot can be charged up to unleash a continuous short range cone of energy. Picking up a Hurricane upgrade will cause bullets to circle you defensively before shooting forward, and charging will store a full round of bullets up to be fired straight ahead all at once. Up to two bombs can be held at once, and if an enemy bullet hits a bomb it will detonate, saving your ship from damage. If your ship is hit, however, then you will have a few seconds to ram it into whatever shot you and take them down with you. Unlike most scrolling shooter games contact with an enemy ship will not kill you, but they can still push you into the path of bullets.

Play takes place over five levels, first of your launch on Mars, then the approach to the moon, and finally infiltrating the base to destroy its core. Each level ends with a unique boss except stage 4, which ends with 3 bosses.</desc>

	<desc>Past and future are connected in a way mortals do not understand...  A star was glowing up in the sky, and the demon god Alcahest appeared, bringing chaos and destruction to the world. A single swordsman stood in defiance. The four powers that protect the world, the Guardians, gave him their power, and with it the swordsman slew the demon and restored peace in the world. 

Thousand years have passed. And a new battle is already on the way. A cruel emperor leads his troops towards conquest. The kingdom of Panakeia is defending itself with the aid of its knights. Once again, the ominous star shines in the sky, indicating the demon's revival. With the help of Alcahest's power, the evil emperor wants to conquer the world. But the new generation also brings the new hero - the brave swordsman Alen. Aided by the Guardians, Alen must stop the Empire's evil plans and to destroy Alcahest once again.

This is an action game with RPG elements. You wander around slaying enemies in real time combat, gathering treasure on the way, and occasionally participating in boss battles. When you gather enough experience from fighting, you gain extra hit points. You can also upgrade your weapons. On the way you'll meet some characters who will join your party for short time, and you'll be able to use their special attacks and magic.</desc>

Alliances are made, forming two major sides: The Axis and The Federation.  The elite units in these wars are Assault Suits, man-piloted combat mechs called Assault Suits.  Jake is one such pilot, drafted into the Pacific States' Marine Corp under the Federation.

Cybernator is a side scrolling mech combat game and platform game. The player controls Jake as he moves his assault suit left and right on the battlefield. The assault suit can jump and use a jetpack for a short time to increase altitude. The assault suit begins with a Shot machine gun weapon that spreads out fire in front, and a Punch weapon for close melee. Additional weapons can be found during the course of the game and existing weapons improved by the gathering of "P" power-ups, left by defeated enemy. Each level contains a variety of enemies and an end boss which must be destroyed to reach the next level. Some levels take place as horizontally scrolling shooters, in which the Assault suit can move up, down, left and right on the screen... but is constantly advancing towards new threats.</desc>

	<name>Bahamut Lagoon</name>
	<desc>The kingdom of Kahna is in great danger. The evil Emperor Sauzer, obsessed by his world domination ideas, is preparing to invade the kingdom. The king sends his best troops of knights and wizards to face the enemy, but in vain - the kingdom is conquered by Sauzer, the king is murdered, and his lovely daughter is kidnapped. You were brave, Leader of the Dragon Squad, but now you will have to become strong. Remember the promise you gave the princess long time ago: always to be at her side. Supported by his friends and by his faithful dragons, you must now free the princess and the kingdom from the enemy's hands. If only the strongest of the dragons, Bahamut, could be awakened...

Bahamut Lagoon, created by the company which gave us the Final Fantasy games, is a mixture of turn-based strategy and RPG. Control several parties of four characters each, and command different dragons at once. The battles start on a top-down screen typical for strategy games, but often switch to a dynamic "platform" view, such as used in early console RPGs. You also can influence the game by other strategic activities, such as, for example, setting a whole forest on fire, to prevent enemies to come through it.</desc>

	<name>Bakutou Dochers</name>
	<desc>Bakutou Dodgers is a Japan-only action game for up to four players. It superficially resembles Hudson's Bomberman series, with its top-down grid stages and chaotic gameplay, but rather than leaving bombs and waiting for them to explode, the player can shoot energy at blocks and each other.

The goal is to sneak up behind the opponent and shoot them before they can reciprocate. Various power-ups may appear after destructible blocks are removed, which can give the player an edge or, in the case of the ? icon, a possible random negative effect like reversed controls. There are also wandering monsters that can cause damage to anyone they come in contact with. Every combatant has a health bar which depletes at a rate dependent on the attacks they are getting hit by.

The single-player mode involves fighting through various worlds and removing all enemy combatants from the field to progress.</desc>

To fight whoever flies thar yonder in the distance, you send out projectiles, in our case fireballs. These behave differently depending on which of the four main buttons you press: if you press the A button, they fly in a curve towards the upper right part of the screen, if you push the Y button, they go left and down and so on and so forth. Sadly, they move so slowly your opponent has a good three seconds to get out of the way, and in so weird curves that aiming is impossible. Also, the screen constantly twists in all directions.</desc>

	<name>Battle Jockey</name>
	<desc>Battle Jockey is a racing game for up to four players that was developed by Nova and published by Virgin Interactive exclusively in Japan for the Super Famicom.It features horseracing, a far more popular pastime in Japan than elsewhere, and presents three separate modes: the first is the standard single-player story mode, in which the player takes a horse and jockey through training and races; the second is a battle mode which pits up to four players against each other in races that have far more power-ups and other unusual additions to the game's courses; and the third is a passive gambling mode in which the player puts money down on horses depending on their odds of winning and subsequent payouts and then watches the race play out with CPU players.The standard mode involves carefully managing the horse's stamina: being too aggressive will cause it to rear up in protest. Falling behind or running into a hedge or jump will cause the horse to lose stamina, and losing all stamina causes it to collapse briefly. The player needs to keep a steady pace, steer carefully around corners, jump at the right times and use the boost sparingly in order to win. In the battle mode stamina is less of a concern and the game more resembles RC Pro-Am: the players have to simply follow the course and avoid the dangers as they show up.</desc>

	<name>Sailor Moon : Another Story</name>
	<desc>The game is based on the Japanese manga and animé series Bishoujo Senshi: Sailor Moon - "Bishoujo Senshi" roughly meaning "Pretty Young Girl Warrior". It is set in the 30th century, in a futuristic city Crystal Tokyo. In this city lives a totally ordinary (at first) fourteen-year old girl Usagi. When she meets a magical cat named Luna, she finds out that she is in fact a princess sent to the future in order to fight the minions of Darkness. She discovers within herself the power to transform into the hero of darkness, Sailor Moon, meets other warriors who help her on her quest, and fights the evil Queen Beryl, hostile aliens, and other foes.

The events of this game take place shortly after Bishoujo Senshi Sailor Moon S, the fourth volume of the long-running series. A global peace is established in the universe, but lately suspicious things are happening. A strange meteorite is seen approaching the Earth. Street gangs and spies who work for a mysterious person called Apsu are seen in Crystal Tokyo. And the Mystic Silver Crystal, the Ginzuishou, which protects the city, is shaking! Usagi and her friends must now investigate the strange events and face the forces of Darkness once again.

The game is a console-style RPG in Final Fantasy style (battles with your party to the right and the enemies to the left), with a battle system somewhat similar to that of Chrono Trigger: you must form a party out of several available characters, make them participate in battles together, and learn powerful combo attacks.

	<desc>The game is based on the animé series Sailor Moon. The main character of the series is Tsukino Usagi, a 14-year-old schoolgirl who unexpectedly gets involved in an epic adventure. Luna, a magical talking cat, contacts her and tells her she is in fact a Sailor Moon, one of the legendary Pretty Fighters - girls who fight the forces of darkness and protect the Kingdom of Moon. 

The game is based on the events of the animé that follow the victory of Usagi and her friends over the Queen Beryl. Peace has returned to the Moon Kingdom. But suddenly, a little girl named Chibiusa arrives from the future and says the future kingdom is threatened by the forces of the evil Prince Diamond. Looks like you are the only ones who can defeat him, and save the future Sailor Moon, Chibiusa's mother.

This is a beat-'em up game. You can play as either Usagi or any of her girlfriends, including Chibiusa. You move on a platform and fight the enemies by punching, kicking, and throwing them, and by using special abilities unique to each character. You can advance only after you have cleared an area from enemies.

	<name>Sailor Moon S : Kondo wa Puzzle de Oshioki yo</name>
	<desc>Bishoujo Senshi Sailor Moon S: Kondoha Puzzle de Oshiokiyo is a falling block competitive puzzle game. Players begin by choosing from a selection of Sailor Moon licensed characters, each with a unique special attack. The player is presented with a board filled with colored blocks in three colors: red, blue and green. The goal is to remove all the blocks from play. Clicking on a block that touches several adjacent blocks of the same color will remove them all from play. As each player successfully clears blocks, they drop "black blocks" on their opponent as well as increase their power bar. Black blocks cannot be removed by normal means and disappear only when large ammounts of blocks are removed adjacent to them. As the power bar charges, players can unleash their special ability, often an attack on the other player.

This puzzle game is based on the "S" series of Sailor Moon and includes characters from there: Sailor Moon, Sailor Mars, Sailor Venus, Sailor Mercury, Sailor Jupiter, Chibiusa, Tuxedo Mask, Sailor Uranus, Sailor Neptune and Sailor Pluto.

	<name>Sailor Moon S : Kurukkurin</name>
	<desc>Bishoujo Senshi Sailor Moon S: Kurukkurin is a competitive puzzle game featuring Sailor Moon licensed characters. Upon choosing a character (each with unique "special moves"), the player competes against an opponent. Each player controls a grid of 10x6 sections (represented by hearts) initially made up of clear hearts. The player moves their cursor over the clear hearts to turn them into one of four colors: red, yellow, blue and green. Sometimes "treasures" will show up on the board. When several hearts of the same color are adjacent to one another, the player can clear them... which pushes all the hearts (and treasures) down towards the bottom. The goal is to be the player with the most treasures to end the round.

Sailor Moon characters featured are primarily from the "S" Series and includes: Sailor Moon, Sailor Mars, Sailor Mercury, Sailor Venus, Sailor Jupiter, Chibius, Tuxedo Mask, Sailor Neptune, Sailor Uranus and Sailor Pluto.

	<name>Brandish 2 : The Planet Buster</name>
	<desc>The Planet Buster continues the story that was told in the first Brandish game, and depicts the events that happened three years after the evil demonic king was defeated in his lost kingdom, sunken deep underground. You take control of a young warrior named Ares, who wields a magical weapon, a powerful sword called the Planet Buster. One day, while traveling through a desert, Ares is captured by a warlock named Karl, who is after the powers hidden within the magical sword. Suspecting Ares might have some valuable information, Karl doesn't execute him, but takes away the Planet Buster and throws Ares into his underground prison. Now your primary goal is to guide Ares out of the huge prison full of various dangers, and to get your mighty weapon back.

The game is an action RPG with a heavy emphasis on dungeon crawling. You guide Ares through rotating dungeons, fighting enemies in real-time combat, casting spells, and solving an occasional puzzle. You have the ability to jump forwards and to attack inanimate objects such as doors to cause damage and to break the object.

	<name>Captain Tsubasa J</name>
	<desc>A 1995 Japan-exclusive Captain Tsubasa video game developed and published by Bandai and was the final Captain Tsubasa game for the Super Famicom.
This game suffered lots of changes from previous games made by Tecmo, this time you will be playing in a real soccer field and in real time, which means that you need to press certain keys even without having the chance of stopping the time (like in previous games), When a certain player is confronted with a one that he considers his rival (like Misugi and Schneider or Tsubasa and *any other player*, for example) they will have a fight, which is mainly a button smashing sequence. The same goes for the sequence in which a goalkeeper tries to stop any of the special shots.
This game has almost the same story as the Captain Tsubasa J anime, except that this one will finish with a special match against an extra team. So, you'll play across various chapters, playing with Aoi Shingo in Italy or controlling the mythic Ozora Tsubasa in his match against the brazillian prodigy, Carlos Santana (nope, he isn't the singer). You'll also play with Japan national team against the same opponents as they did in the anime version..</desc>

	<desc>CB Chara Wars, sometimes written with the subtitle Ushinawareta Gag, is an RPG that features a crossover of sorts of Go Nagai's various manga franchises. These include Devilman and Mazinger Z, among others. The "CB" in the title refers to the term "chibi", which depicts characters as smaller and cuter than usual. In that sense, it is similar to the term SD (super deformation) found in several Super Famicokm Gundam game titles.CB Chara Wars began as an original video animation which first aired in 1991. A manga adaptation followed the following year, as did this game. Banpresto published the game in Japan, a company known for creating games with anime crossovers such as the Super Robot Taisen/Wars series.</desc>

	<name>Chinhai</name>
	<desc>Chinhai is a puzzle game for the Super Famicom and a variant on Mahjong Solitaire, or Shanghai. Instead of pairing and removing any two tiles that match as long as one of their sides is clear, as is the case in Shanghai, the rules of Chinhai require that the two tiles can only be removed if it's possible to draw a line between the two that doesn't make a 90 degree turn more than twice. Two tiles on opposite sides of the board, for instance, can't be paired because it would take three 90 degree turns to draw a line between them. To account for this added difficulty, the game lacks the "stacks" of tiles that frequently appear in Shanghai, instead presenting a flat board of tiles.Chinhai is named for the municipality of Chinhai in China, maintaining the theme of naming mahjong solitaire variants after territories in China. Chinhai has long since been renamed Zhenhai, which is situated in the Ningpo Prefecture and now part of a much larger city. This mahjong solitaire variant is perhaps best known as Sichuan or Shisenshou, also named for a province in China.</desc>

	<desc>The Cho Aniki series makes it's debut on the SNES with all of it's homo-erotic, pseudo humorous, bizarre, sweaty bodybuilding charm, but with one major gameplay change. Instead of being another side-scrolling shooter, Bakuretsu Rantouden is actually a one-on-one 2D fighter a la Street Fighter in which the most recognizable characters from the Cho Aniki series (yes the speedo wearing bodybuilders included) fight each other for ultimate supremacy using special attacks and moves.

An interesting feature is that the game honors it's shooter roots, therefore instead of being restricted to walking backwards and forwards in the 2D plane and jumping around as in other fighting games, in this game all the characters can fly meaning the fights actually occur in mid-air allowing the players to dash all over the screen. Includes single player and 2-player vs modes.

	<name>Super B.C. Kid 2</name>
	<desc>?In this sidescrolling action-platformer, Bonk is once again trying to save his world from the evil clutches of the reptilian king, who once more is threatening the prehistoric era.  Boy, you'd think that after being defeated four times prior that he would take a hint.  This time, you also get to face his five best soldiers, who will try to stop you in your tracks.  Bonk controls rather smoothly, and he is really fun to control.  To those of you that are not familiar with the series, Bonk is a caveman who attacks his enemies with his noggin; after jumping down, from below, while swimming, and while in the air.  He can even bounce off walls with his head, skip on the water like a stone if his head is facing down, climb certain walls with his teeth, scale up waterfalls, flip in the air (so long as the attack button is repeatedly being tapped), and so forth.  As is the case with the series, you start with a regular amount of health, but if you find a translucent heart icon, you'll increase your capacity.  What's neat is how collecting the food not only scores you some points but how it also replenishes a little bit of your health, too.  This time Bonk can also run if you hold down the A button, and the X button is used if you have a special ability on you.  If you find a power-up, whether it be piece of meat, or a different icon, then you will be given a power-up ability that will be taken out the moment you're hit once (damn).  Among the power-ups are the one where the fire will be spreading if Bonk hits his head on the ground (you know, the one where he looks freaky), one where Bonk turns into a bird and gains the ability to fly, one where Bonk becomes tiny and can make platforms made out of Japanese characters, and there is one where Bonk has the ability to double-jump as a girl.  Yes, Bonk becomes a girl if he eats the pink-colored meat.  I'm dead serious.</desc>

	<name>Choujikuu Yousai Macross : Scrambled Valkyrie</name>
	<desc>The legend of the Valkyrie pilots is not yet over. Hikaru, Max, and Millia take flight to defend the earth from Zentraedi, robots, more robots, and giant space crab-bees. Now is the time to scramble Valkyrie again. 

When starting a game or continuing the player picks from either Hikaru, Max, or Millia. Each flies a custom Valkyrie with its own set weapon load-out. A Valkyrie changes its weapon and movement speed by switching between its three forms: Fighter, Gerwalk, and Battroid. Typically the Valkyrie weapon shoots straight and quickly, the Gerwalk weapon shoots around or through obstacles, and the Battroid weapon does higher damage in exchange for reduced firing rate. Each weapon can be upgraded up to twice by picking up power up items dropped by special enemy ships, but one level of power up will be lost any time the Valkyrie is shot. If a Valkyrie's entire life bar is depleted then the full stage must be repeated, provided the player still has enough continues.

In a nod to Galaga the player is able to capture some enemy craft to increase their firepower. If the player does not shoot any weapons for a few seconds a field of electricity will cover the Valkyrie. Touching some enemy ships will then cause their targeting to be shorted out and make them friendly to the player, following along and shooting or ramming onscreen enemies.

	<name>Chou Mahou Tairiku Wozz </name>
	<desc>The magic world of Wozz, populated by magicians, alchemists, and other kinds of people - including simple town and village inhabitants - was a seemingly peaceful place, until one day, a poisonous rain started turning its inhabitants into monsters. The chief wizard realizes that the demon Balaam is trying to link the world of Wozz with the world of humans. Only a human hero can stop Balaam, and the wizard's teleporting magic brings... three young humans: the Japanese girl Reona Kitazato, and two boys: the American Shot Phoenix and the Chinese Chun Chingtao. Will those youngsters be able to stop Balaam?

The game is a traditional console-style RPG similar to Breath of Fire: turn-based battles are viewed from an isometric perspective. You control all three characters as a party, but in the beginning of the game you choose one of them as the main character, and therefore will see the game from his/her perspective. In case the characters split up, you'll be able to control only the one you chose.

	<desc>Cosmo Gang: The Puzzle is a puzzle game from Namco and the second game to feature their Cosmo Gang characters. The Cosmo Gang were originally attached to a group of redemption games (like pachinko or claw machines) from Namco, but would eventually star in two Arcade games: Cosmo Gang: The Video, a Galaga clone, and Cosmo Gang: The Puzzle.

This game would become the basis of Namco's more well-known puzzle game Pac-Attack, featuring Pac-Man. As with Pac-Attack, the idea is to stack up a lot of the animated face icons (members of the Cosmo Gang) in an unbroken chain and then drop a bomb (shaped like an arrow) that goes down the chain and eliminates them all at once.</desc>

The Cosmo Gang are based on a series of characters that had previously been used by Namco for a redemption game (a type of Arcade machine that dispenses award tokens for winning a rudimentary game, of which pachinko is the most popular variant) the previous year.

	<desc>Once again the universe is at peril from invaders from beyond, but this time their target is Earth! Galivan and company don't have time to find items or level up weapons as in Galivan's previous outing; this is a no holds barred slugfest. Three characters are playable, each with varying stats but basically the same moveset. Each character has a standard straight ahead punch or kick, a sweeping kick, an uppercut, and a ranged attack that must be charged up. At the start of the game and the end of every level the player can add stat points to their character to increase their HP, defense, jump height, and strength of normal and special attacks.

A 2 player versus mode is included as well. Both players can choose from the three main characters, and the second player can additionally choose from one of the four normal enemy types.</desc>

	<name>Crayon Shin Chan</name>
	<desc>Five-year-old Shinnosuke Nohara is the epitome of noisy children: loud and inappropriate, infuriating to his parents, and hilarious to onlookers. Shin-chan is always getting in trouble with his parents and saying bizarre or offensive things to everyone he meets. Every so often, though, he'll try to do what his mom wants him to, but more often than not, he'll misunderstand and simply confound his parents further.

Arashi o Yobu Enji ("A Kindergartner Called Tempest") is one of many games based on the manga and anime created by Yoshito Usui. In four stages, each made up of five areas, Shin-chan must explore his neighborhood looking for a specific object. He can enter houses to ask people for information, but will often end up simply insulting them. He must also avoid or knock over the other children in the neighborhood, and has various ability cards that he can use to assist him, which might give him a water pistol or refill his health. After finding what he's looking for, Shin-chan will move on to the next area.

Also included is a minigame mode with eight different minigames, such as a bubble-blowing contest, a three-legged race, and a desperate search for clothing before school. The entire game, including the minigames, is filled with dialogue containing the same humor as the source material.

Many of the bosses are transformed versions of Shin-chan's friends and family.

The game is a standard side-scrolling 2D platformer - common with licensed games - though it is notable for letting players decide which order they want to tackle stages, not to mention the franchise's penchant for weird/gross-out humor.</desc>

	<desc>There was once a prosperous kingdom, a peaceful kingdom, ruled by a wise old king, where all peopled lived happily together, protected by the power of a magical crystal. But one day, several dark clouds appeared over the kingdom and poured down a devastating rain. And then one of the clouds turned into a demon, and, reaching its hands to the treasure room in the palace, took the crystal away. The demon lord, still in a form of a menacing dark cloud, started spawning monsters and sending them to attack the now helpless kingdom. The king called to the heavens for help. Eight magical weapons fell on the ground, and eight warriors rose to protect their country. Your task now is to cleanse the land of the monsters and to defeat the evil demon lord.

"Crystal Beans" is an action RPG based on fighting and dungeon crawling. You can play as either of the eight initial character classes: Fighter, Warrior, Bow-man, Wizard, Priest, Kage (a kind of a ninja), Monk, or Witch. In addition, there are four secret classes you discover during your journey. Each class has its own strength and weaknesses, and two unique attack types.</desc>

	<name>Cu-On-Pa SFC</name>
	<desc>Cu-On-Pa SFC is the Super Famicom version of Cu-On-Pa.Cu-On-Pa is an original puzzle game that was developed by a little-known group called Onesong Partners. This group originally released an obscure game similar to this but with a wider audience in mind, various enhancements and alternate modes for PCs called "Endorfun" in 1995 in the U.S and Europe.Japanese developers seemed to like the concept and got permission to make something like it based on the original principals of Endorfun for the obscure Satellaview (or BS-X) and then later as a standalone release for the Super Famicom, where the game was called BS Cu-On-Pa and Cu-On-Pa, respectively. It would also get released later for Playstation.Published by T&amp;E Soft for the SFC late in 1996, Cu-On-Pa was also fan-translated sometime later for the emulation community, though the game comes with a rather straightforward tutorial and the game is very easy to understand, but difficult to master. This game is difficult to describe and in a league of its own.You play as a three-dimensional cube that must destroy all the "Life Panels" on a level. To do so, you have to rotate your cube and roll over the colored squares on the transparent field. Panels come in a variety of colors and the main way to elimate them is by having the color on the top of the cube match the color of the tile beneath you.The other way is for more skilled players and comes in the form of "Lightning Panels", which are generated when you destroy panels other than Life Panels. Destroy enough of them and you'll have lots of them. Then go and destroy a life panel! What will happen is, all lightning panels will explode that match the color of the life panel you rolled over. Moreover, the explosion spreads and detonates other tiles in the vicinity, which can spread and create a chain reaction. It's up to you how you wish to rack up points, either by time, chains, or both.Ken Kojima was the music composer.</desc>

	<name>Cyber Knight</name>
	<desc>In the 24th century, mankind has gone into space. The crew of the starship Swordfish are in an engagement with space pirates when the battle takes a turn for the worse. In desperation, the crew activate their jump drive without a destination... and end up flung across the galaxy to the galactic core. The Swordfish however is badly damaged with many casualties including the captain. Only 26 of the crew survive, and of them only 6 are qualified for combat: The commander, two soldiers, a mechanic and a doctor and six giant "Module" mechanized suits available for them. These survivors locate planet Farworld, apparently colonized by humans. There they discover the colony is under attack by a relentless mechanical aliens dubbed "Berserkers". The crew of the swordfish must fight back against the Berserkers and explore the galaxy for some means to return home.

Cyber Knight is an RPG with a science-fiction theme of being lost in an alien galaxy. The game takes place in a top-down view for movement on planets and areas, a side-view for combat sequences and a first person menu system when aboard the Swordfish starship. The Swordfish can travel between stars, scanning worlds for information. If the ship is able to land on a planet, three crew members piloting three Modules (giant robots) can be selected to debark and explore the planet. Many planets will have towns or people living on them which can be talked to in order to uncover information. Different quests are assigned in order to find the items necessary to progress. There is no system of currency or buying items. Instead, many defeated Berserkers leave behind "NeoParts", which can be brought back to the Swordfish's lab. Analysis of these Neo parts unlocks enhances statistics (endurance, agility, accuracy, etc) for the Modules and new weapons for them to carry. The six modules are unique in statistics, and also the six pilots each carry different skills.

Combat takes place in turn-based combat on a 6x6 squares field. Seen from the side view, the three modules can be positioned in relation to enemies in order to attack, using a variety of melee and long-ranged weaponry. Ammunition is unlimited, but each module also carries a number of "options" that are consumable attacks. Each Module has two sets of hitpoints: one for the pilot and one for the module itself. If either one of these reaches zero, the module is destroyed. In order to heal, the party carries 10 each of repair kits and first aid kits, which must when not in combat. These kits, as well as options and defeated pilots or modules can be restored by returning to the Swordfish.</desc>

	<desc>Following the events of the first Cyber Knight in the 24th century, the crew of the Swordfish have returned to Earth after defeating the mechanical "Berzerkers" far across space. However during their time away, the Earth Federation has been taken over by the ambitious General Forrest, who seeks to wage war on the independent systems and conquer them. Recognizing the potential weapons that could be made from the Berzerker science data, Forrest impounds the Swordfish and jails it's crew. The Berzerker data is used to create "Overtech" and bring to life "Metalliforms", self-replicating war machines. The Swordfish crew manages to escape, thanks to a mysterious agent "CJ", and are recruited into the resistance against the Earth Federation. Given a new spaceship, the Galvodirge, they must travel the galaxy to different human civilizations and devise a plan to stop Earth's attack.

Cyber Knight II is an RPG with science-fiction themes. As in the first game, much of the game takes place in a top-down view for movement on planets and areas, a side-view for combat sequences and a first person menu system when aboard the Galvodirge starship. The Galvodirge can travel between stars, scanning worlds for information. If the ship is able to land on a planet, the crew can debark either on foot or using combat modules (mechs). Some areas are only accessible using modules and others (such as towns) do not allow the use of these war machines. Many planets will have towns or people living on them which can be talked to in order to uncover information. Different quests are assigned in order to find the items necessary to progress. There is no system of currency or buying items. Instead, many defeated enemies leave behind "NeoParts", which can be brought back to the Swordfish's lab. Analysis of these Neo parts unlocks enhances statistics (endurance, agility, accuracy, etc) for the Modules and new weapons for them to carry. 

The crew are divided into a three person "combat team" and a three person "support team". If modules are used, they can be assigned from the ship's hanger. Unlike the first game, modules only perform a combat or a support role, and each is unique in statistics and the type of weaponry it can carry. When combat occurs on the main map, the support team will often deliver the first strike by firing missiles into the enemies. When searching facilities, caves or other locations, the support team is not available. Following either case, the combat team engages the enemy in turn-based combat on a 6x6 squares field. Seen from the side view, the three modules can be positioned in relation to enemies in order to attack, using a variety of melee and long-ranged weaponry. Ammunition is unlimited, but each module also carries a number of "options" that are consumable attacks. Each Module has two sets of hitpoints: one for the pilot and one for the module itself. If either one of these reaches zero, the module is destroyed. In order to heal, the party carries 10 each of repair kits and first aid kits, which must when not in combat. These kits, as well as options and defeated pilots or modules can be restored by returning to the Galvodirge.</desc>

	<name>Cyborg 009</name>
	<desc>Nine young people were turned into cyborgs by a company trying to take over the world. They have defeated this company and are now using their super powers to protect the world.

Based on the manga/anime by the same name, Cyborg 009 is a side-scrolling platformer in which the player takes control of 8 different cyborgs, using their special abilities to complete several missions. 

Their special abilities are as follows:
002 can fly and hover in the air; 003 can see in the dark; 004 can fire bullets from his fingers and rockets from his knees; 005 can break rocks with his fists; 006 can blow fire that also melts rocks; 007 can take on different shapes including those of enemies; 008 can swim underwater for extended periods of time; 009 can move at very high speeds. (001 is a baby and can't be taken on missions). Using these special abilities consumes SP that slowly regenerate. 

In addition to their special abilities, the cyborgs also have four attributes that govern their attack and defensive powers, their amount of SP and SP regeneration speed. 

Before every mission, one cyborg is assigned leader and two more can be selected by the player. Only one cyborg can be controlled at a time, but it is possible to switch between cyborgs at any time. All cyborgs share the same HP and SP-bar. Throughout the levels, experience points can be collected and used to increase a cyborg's attributes after a completed mission.</desc>

The heroes of the last war are formed into a unit known as Londo Bell; however, the Earth Federation distrusts them due to their immense power, and provides them with as few resources as they can...</desc>

	<name>Dark Half</name>
	<desc>Through the Light came the Darkness, and through the Darkness came the Light. They were inseparable in the beginning, and gave birth to each other. Rukyu appeared before all the other creatures, the great demon of darkness, later to be known as the Satan. The divine hero-god Roda went up to his dark realm to defeat him, but was struck down, and presumed dead. But the hero couldn't die so easily: he swore to defeat Rukyu once and for all. Meanwhile, Rukyu doesn't just stay in his realm, waiting for Roda: he goes out to the world as a death-bringing sorcerer, and he is out for Roda...

The game is quite different from most other RPGs, because it lets you play as both the "good" hero and the villain. The game is divided into chapters, and each chapter is played by either Roda or Rukyu. You switch the two heroes chapter-after-chapter, and lead them to their ultimate battle from two opposite sides. The entire game, including the battles, is viewed from an isometric perspective. The battles are random and turn-based, and the battle field is divided into squares you can position and move your characters on. Both Roda and Rukyu can have party members join them, and both attack mostly with magic. Rukyu uses a special energy called "Soul Power", while Roda cast one-time spells from scrolls he receives after battles.</desc>

	<path>./Dark Law - Meaning of Death (Japan) (Translated En).swc</path>
	<name>Dark Law: The Meaning of Death</name>
	<desc>Three-hundred years ago, there were two kingdoms on the earth -Reyfore, ruled by the benevolent and mighty king Reynard, and Amugnon, ruled by king Daruk. The two kingdoms could have lived in peace, but pride took over king Daruk, he didn't respect the Goddess any more, and as a result his mind became obsessed by the idea of destruction. Daruk attacked Reyfore, and for decades war was embracing the two kingdoms, setting the Earth in flames. After a prolonged battle, king Reynard defeated king Daruk, and a reign of prosperity began once again.

But can evil be truly defeated? The hero of the game, a young adventurer, falls down from a cliff while taking a stroll near the ancient Sophia Temple. He is saved by an old man who lives with his daughter Refia in a small country house. But one day, a demonic-looking knight appears, accompanied by monsters, kills the old man, and kidnaps Refia. The old man recognized the knight - it was king Daruk! Now the hero must bring Refia back and defeat Daruk once and for all.

The game has a less linear structure than a standard console-style RPG: together with the main story there are many missions, or "scenarios", which are not obligatory to complete, but which occupy a large portion of the game. In the beginning of the game you create a party of four characters, the hero and his three companions. The battles are pre-determined and take place on the same screen as the gameworld itself. Your party and the enemies can move freely around the screen and attack with melee and ranged weapons, and their actions depend on the amount of action points they have. Navigation in town is menu-based.</desc>

	<desc>Dear Boys is a 1994 Super Famicom basketball game based on the manga of the same name. The game features both a story mode, which follows the plot of the manga, and an exhibition mode that allows the player to go straight into a match.

The game features a "dramatic" perspective that is also slightly turn-based, similar to the Captain Tsubasa games. A window demonstrates what is happening - a ball is passed, a shot is thrown, the tip-off - in dramatic comic book style that is reminiscent of the manga. While a player's athlete has the ball, the player can pull up a menu that allows them to choose to pass, shoot or look at the present characters stats - each character has their own strengths and weaknesses that the player should keep in mind.</desc>

	<name>Dharma Doujou</name>
	<desc>Dharma Doujou was originally released in the arcades by Metro3D in 1994 (picture on the left). While the original version provides the same gameplay as the Super Famicom version tested here, the game does have some noticeable differences. First of all, it has more enemies and features colorful backgrounds borrowed from traditional Japanese themes and myths (well, in the Korean version of the game, Metro3D apparently threw in a couple of bikini girls for good measure). Additionally, the arcade game only contains a story mode and there is no progress map or alternate game modes like in the Super Famicom port. But, most importantly, the gameplay is slightly different - the player has to move the character around the screen in order to hit a block with the mallet. The Super Famicon version, on the contrary, automatically aligns the player with the furthest most block, and this apparently minor difference makes the gameplay of the home conversion more fast-paced and enjoyable than the original.</desc>

	<desc>The game is based on the animé series "Doraemon". Doraemon is a blue robotic cat who has the ability to enter dream world and to help the people who live there. In this game, Nobita, a bespectacled friend of Doraemon's, suddenly meets a little fairy. Long ago, humans and fairies lived together in peace, but since the humans started developing their technology, the fairies have no place any more. Nobita and Doraemon travel to the dream world to find out how can they help.

The game is divided into adventure and platform action modes. In adventure mode, you navigate Doraemon from a top-down view, talking to people and entering houses. When you have gathered enough information, a place on the map will be highlighted. If Doraemon (or other characters, later in the game) enters this place, a platform action section begins. In platform mode, Doraemon must overcome the obstacles and defeat enemies by jumping on them or by throwing magic dusk at them, in order to retrieve important items.

It is based on the manga "Doraemon", that tells the story of a Japanese boy named Nobita, who always gets bullied by stronger kids in the school. In the future, his grandson uses a time machine and send the cat-like robot Doraemon to protect Nobita. In this adventure, Nobita, Doraemon, and their friends travel to the Toys Land. Some evil toys are threatening this country, and it's up to our heroes to help its inhabitants.

The game is divided into adventure and platform action modes. In adventure mode, Doraemon walks around towns, talking to people and entering houses. Key locations lead to platform levels, which must be completed to advance the story. Platform levels include plenty of obstacles (pits, spikes, self-destructing platforms etc.), as well as various enemies who try to stop the heroes. You can choose one of the six available characters to play through the platform level. They all can jump and defeat enemies either by jumping on their heads or by using long-ranged weapons.

Each character has his own weapon and possesses a special ability (for example, Suneo can crawl through narrow spaces, etc.) which is often required to complete a stage. In present time, you travel through Nobita's town in top down view, talking to characters and entering houses. There is also a slight RPG element in the game, as you can buy items and upgrade your weapons.

	<desc>A young boy named Milon sets off to save Alis, his fairy friend, after she was captured by the evil sorcerer Amon. He later learns that the only way to defeat Amon is by collecting five legendary instruments which Amon has stolen.  The sorcerer placed a curse on these instruments so that their true powers cannot be used and then left them in the hands of his minions.  The only way to lift the curse is by collecting five stars.

Armed with only his bubble shooter, Milon must retrieve the legendary instruments, lift their curses and use their powers to defeat Amon and rescue Alis.

Traveling through many different worlds starting with the forest, Milon will be confronted by many enemies. Milon can either shoot bubbles to trap and send his enemies away, or he can jump and flatten his enemies temporarily turning them into a platform for him to walk across. 

Milon has three different "outfits": red, blue, and green. With the green outfit, Milon can withstand three hits. Each time he gets hit, he will be downgraded a color - green to blue, blue to red. If he gets hit with the red outfit, he will die and have to start the level over.

By collecting 100 music notes, Milon will get an extra life. There are also other useful items to get like bubble gum that will save Milon once if he were to fall, a special bubble shooter that let's him shoot multiple bubbles at once and a star that makes Milon temporarily invincible so that he can defeat enemies simply by running at them.</desc>

	<name>Dossun ! Ganseki Battle</name>
	<desc>A falling block puzzle game  in a pseudo-medieval fantasy setting that pits two characters against each other in an abstract form of combat that is quite similar to games like Columns. Combining at least three matching symbols in a vertical, horizontal or diagonal line does not only clear them off the screen, but also deals damage to an opponent. This means that players do not only have to keep their game area clear, but also pay attention to their characters health bar. Once a block touches the top of the screen or the health bar is diminished the game ends.

There are four different icons that have different effects when combined:
Books, swords and rocks deal damage to an opponent by attacking with fireballs, dragons or swords.
Bottles heal a certain amount of health.
Purple blocks have no effect, but clog up the screen nonetheless.

Chain reactions result in particularly powerful attacks or place one or more grey blocks inside the opponents area. They can be destroyed just like ordinary blocks, but they always stay in the same spot and do not fall down.

More complex chain reactions give access to special attacks, up to three of which can be held and activated with the shoulder buttons. Special attacks have different effects that include clearing all purple blocks, using all potions and clearing the bottom three lines.

	<name>Downtown Nekketsu Baseball Monogatari</name>
	<desc>Another sports title in the Nekketsu High game series, this time featuring the Nekketsu guys go at each other's throat while playing baseball.

The game features a single play, Vs and Tournament/story mode. The gameplay itself is similar to other baseball games in the sense that it subdivides the different stages of baseball (batting, pitching, running bases, etc.) in different "mini games" with their own camera angles and interfaces.

As expected of a Nekketsu game you can play it rough by sneaking punches and kicks to "bend" the rules a bit, you can also use the "ki" or willpower of your players to trigger special moves and strategic management is limited to specifying different base strategies and behaviors for each player.</desc>

	<name>Dragon Ball Z Super Gokuden : Kakusei Hen</name>
	<desc>This is a direct sequel to the  first "interactive fighter" for SNES, based on the popular manga/animé series Dragon Ball. The game picks up the story where it ended in the previous game, and continues through Piccolo, Saiyajin, and Freezer sagas of the manga. After the battle with the Demon King (Daimaou) Piccolo, the twenty-third World Martial Arts Tournament is about to begin. But to the amazement of the hero Son Goku and his friends, their archrival Piccolo appears during the tournament, so that it quickly turns into a genuine battle.

You control Son Goku and his son Son Gohan, switching between them as the game progresses. The game is basically an interactive comic book in which you can influence the story by choosing to press a button when the game prompts you to make a choice. You'll also participate in battles. The battle system is similar to rock-paper-scissors game, where one kind of move always beats or always loses to another. You can dash into your enemies, attack physically, and perform special moves, pressing the buttons in real time (although the battles are divided into turns).

	<path>./Dragon Ball Z - Super Saiya Densetsu (Japan) (Translated En).swc</path>
	<name>Dragon Ball Z : Legend of the Super Saiyan</name>
	<desc>Cho Saiya Densetsu is based on the popular manga/animé series Dragon Ball. It follows the events described in the beginning of Dragon Ball Z, the second story block, which tells about the connection of the hero Son Goku with a powerful alien race, and new mighty foes from far away planets. The game starts just where the tale of Dragon Ball begins. Son Goku goes to meet his friends, but is stopped by a mysterious stranger named Raditz who tells Son Goku they are relatives. Raditz demands from him to destroy humanity, and as Son Goku refuses, takes his son Son Gohan hostage. To rescue his son, Son Goku joins forces with his arch-rival, the Demon King Piccolo, who obviously has his own plans concerning Raditz. And thus begins the story during which Son Goku will learn of his true origin...

The game is a RPG similar to the card-based Dragon Ball Z RPGs for NES. During battles, you choose cards from your card inventory, which determine the nature and the strength of your characters' attacks. You can also train your characters in training houses and upgrade their special Ki power. Unlike early DBZ RPGs, you can move around freely in Cho Saiya Densetsu, and your movements are not determined by cards. You can also fly around the world and use your special Dragon Radar to discover location of magical Dragon Balls.

	<name>Dragon Quest I.II</name>
	<desc>This is a remake of two classic NES RPGs - an exclusively Japanese release of the two first Dragon Quest titles on one cartridge.

In Dragon Quest (known as Dragon Warrior in the US), you play as the descendant of the legendary warrior Erdrick, and your goal is to recover the magical Ball of Light from Erdrick's and the humanity's arch-enemy, the Dragon Lord. In Dragon Quest II, you assume the role of the descendant of the hero of the first game, and must join forces with two other characters in order to defeat a demon lord who destroyed a nearby city and killed its inhabitants. 

Both RPGs feature random battles and turn-based combat viewed from first-person perspective. In Dragon Quest you fight alone, while in the sequel two other characters can join your party, and you also fight against multiple enemies at once.

The remake includes updated graphics (although they still retain the original NES look), sound of SNES quality, and some changes in the gameplay and in the game world. Certain locations are larger, some menu commands (such as "Stairs") are omitted, and there is a larger variety of items.

	<name>Dragon Quest III</name>
	<desc>Dragon Warrior III is the concluding game of the first Dragon Quest/Dragon Warrior trilogy, and its story takes us back to the time period of the legendary Erdrick (also known as Loto), the ancestor of the first game's hero. You are the son of a powerful warrior Ortega, skillful in physical combat and spellcasting. Your father went out to fight the evil Baramos, who is responsible for the appearance of monsters in your region, and never returned. You are sent by the king on a quest to continue your father's brave deeds and to defeat Baramos.

Dragon Warrior III is a top-down role-playing game where you travel around the overworld, caves, castles, cities and other locations while battling random encounters, buying equipment, and talking to people. You and your party members receive experience when they beat up monsters and level up with enough experience, increasing their stats. The game features a day/night cycle - as you travel, day slowly changes to night and vice versa; shops are typically closed at night. 

You begin with control of just the main character but can quickly recruit three more members to your party. During the game you can choose to drop your current characters and recruit others at any time. The recruitable characters are divided into six classes: soldier, fighter, merchant, goof-off, pilgrim and wizard.

The game has a unique job system, giving you the ability to switch your hired characters' classes after they have achieved at least level 20 in their base class. Characters can switch to the other beginning classes, as well as the sage class, which is not available at the beginning. When a character switches classes, they lose all earned experience points, and half of their stats, but retain all of the abilities of the previous class. In this way, you can create powerful combination characters that are able to cast spells and fight effectively.

	<name>Dragon Quest V</name>
	<desc>You are the son of the brave warrior, Lord Papas. It appears that your mother died just after giving birth to you, and your father took you on a long journey when you were a little baby, and all you know is that he was searching for something. Now you are six years old, and Lord Papas brings you to your home village. After some time, you learn that His Highness Prince Henry was kidnapped by bandits. Your father attempts to rescue him, and during this action you discover that perhaps your mother is still alive... The game follows the story of Papas' son, and this story is stretched over years, as the hero grows and becomes a man of courage and virtue. During the game, the hero will discover the truth about his mother, and will have to make some crucial decisions, such as which girl to marry (the decisions affect the course of the game and its ending).

"Dragon Quest V" is a party RPG with turn-based combat, and battles viewed from 1st person perspective, just like all its predecessors. Your party roams about the world, fighting random enemies, performing quests, and defeating bosses. The novelty is in the game's unusual story, which spans almost a lifetime of the hero. 

"Dragon Quest V" was not available outside of Japan until 2009, when the DS version was released in the United States.

Was this just a dream? You have just fallen out of your bed dreaming! It's time to go to the village elder, to get a seemingly simple assignment - to sell some goods at a bazaar in the nearest town. But soon the hero will discover his dream was not so far away from reality...

"Dragon Quest VI" is the last SNES game of the Dragon Quest series (called "Dragon Warrior" in US). It is a party RPG with turn-based combat and battles viewed from 1st person perspective. Not much has changed since the NES days of Dragon Quest - gameplay style, setting, and even menu layout seem almost identical to those of the early classics. Like its immediate predecessor Dragon Quest V, this game was never released outside Japan.

	<desc>Long time ago, a flourishing civilization was destroyed by the rage of a mighty dragon. The Earth was set in flames, and no one escaped the destruction - no one except one man, who managed to launch himself forward, thousand years into the future. There, he was found by people of Kardosa Empire, who soon understood they have in their hands a human who possesses the secret of a superior ancient technology, that was unknown to the primitive civilization of the present...

You play the role of Aleth, the son of the High Priest in the small kingdom of Garade, whom leads a peaceful life with his friend Lagnus, Prince of Garade. One day Aleth accidentally gains possession of a precious artifact which is sought after by the Kardosa Empire. Aleth and Lagnus get involve in a conflict which will soon lead them to great discoveries of the secrets of the ancient civilization, of the great destruction that occurred thousand years ago, and of their own true identities...

The game is a console-style RPG: your party meets randomly encountered enemies and bosses, and fights them in turn-based combat viewed from isometric perspective. You upgrade armor by buying it, and also can buy weapons, but weapons can also be upgraded for money to different levels, to create powerful attacks called "techs".</desc>

	<desc>Dynamic Stadium is a baseball game from Eleca/Electronics Application released exclusively for the Super Famicom. While adopting the same behind-the-batter perspective as Namco's Famista series, Dynamic Stadium presents its athletes as comic book heroes rather than chibi figures, making them absurdly buff and frequently featuring action shots of them catching fly-balls and narrowly making it to base before being caught out. "Safe!" and "Out!" calls are presented as spiky word balloons.

Dynamic Stadium does not feature an official NPB license, so all the team names are fictitious. The game was published in Japan by Sammy Corporation and was never localized for overseas territories.</desc>

In Edo no Kiba you are always moving forward, either running or walking (or, in some levels, flying), although you can still move around the screen as in most belt-scrolling games. Your avatar attacks by slashing to the right with his energy sword, and he can also hold his sword defensively to deflect some bullets. By then holding forward and releasing attack he can throw the sword like a boomerang. He can also jump. A bomb follows the avatar around on any on-foot level that can be used to destroy all enemies onscreen at any time, and it will be replaced whenever a life is lost. Environments range from city streets to sewers and a flying battleship. Each level ends with a boss fight against an enemy that can withstand many attacks.</desc>

	<name>Emerald Dragon</name>
	<desc>In "Emerald Dragon", you play as Atrushan, a blue dragon who lives in the Dragon World. One day, he and his friends discover a ship wreck near a mountain. After examining the wreck, the dragons find a human child - a little girl. The wise White Dragon, the leader of the dragons, tells them that her name is Tamryn and that she will play an important role in their lives. The girl doesn't remember anything, and grows up together with the dragons. But when she turns fifteen, she decides to go back to her homeland - the Human World. Soon after Tamryn has left, Atrushan realizes he can't bear the separation, and asks the White Dragon to allow him to go and find Tamryn in the Human World. But a mysterious evil curse has been placed on the dragons - they can't appear among the humans in their true form. Atrushan agrees to become a human and goes to the Human World - to find Tamryn, and also a way to remove the curse...

The game features traditional Japanese-style RPG gameplay - Atrushan and his party travel over world map, visiting towns and descending into dungeons. The battle system is somewhat unusual - you can control only Atrushan, while other party members are controlled by the AI. You have a special bar for your actions in battle: once it is depleted, you can't perform any action and must wait for your next turn. You can move freely over the battle field, position yourself strategically near or far away from the enemy, attack from different sides, and assign general strategies to your non-controllable party members.</desc>

	<name>Famicom Tantei Club Part II - Ushiro ni Tatsu Shou</name>
	<desc>An autumn night "3 years ago" a 15-year-old boy (the protagonist of the game) are on the run from two police officers. A man, respected by the police, decides to care of the situation by himself. The man takes the boy to a coffeehouse; the boy ran away from his orphanage to find his parents' whereabouts. The man, a private detective named Shunsuke Utsugi, convinces him to become his assistant.

The objective is to solve two cases; the murder of a schoolgirl investigating her school's ghost story, and an older murder nearing legal expiration. Like the previous game in the series, the game progresses as the player chooses from a set of commands displayed on a menu. These commands are used to interact with other characters and the game's environment, examine clues, or review facts. The results of choosing each command are displayed in the text.</desc>

	<name>FEDA: The Emblem of Justice</name>
	<desc>In a fantasy world, a soldier from the imperial forces deserts after witnessing the massacre of innocent villagers by his unit. He is sent to jail to be executed, but manages to escape with the help of two former unit colleagues. The group flees through the country-side, while being pursued by imperial soldiers. On their way, they join forces with other rebels to fight against the enemy, while uncovering hidden secrets and evil plots by the Empire.

FEDA: Emblem of Justice is a strategy RPG similar to Shining Force and other titles with preset characters and linear gameplay. The player commands a party of varying size and characters with diverse skills.

In the main battle sections, the player and the CPU-controlled enemy take turns moving the troops and giving orders. A menu at the bottom of the screen shows all the possible actions, where soldiers can defend, move, attack, or use an inventory item on each turn. The range of their movements and weapons vary according to their nature. A crossbow character can shoot from the back, while most sword and knife users have to be adjacent to their targets. Magic offensive powers have different ranges as well, reaching enemies that are far away from the attacking character. Health points can be recovered by eating rations or by magic, where a healer can restore points to several characters at once.

Each party member has separate health and magic points, as well as other statistics like defense and attack power. They receive experience points after slaying an enemy or casting a spell, and extra points at the end of the battle. Their skills increase after surpassing 100 points.

The map screen shows the party and groups of enemies traveling through the landscape in turns. The menu has options for moving the group or camping. In the encampment, one of the characters around the fire pit saves the game, while another inside the tent provides system options to change the interface color, adjust sound volume and rename the party members.

In some locations like temples, villages and towns, the party has to explore the place and talk to the citizens to move on to the next section. In later battles, the player has to make a moral choice about attacking mutated humans. At the end of each battle, the party is assigned a dark or light emblem, and certain party members choose to leave or stay in the group based on its alignment.</desc>

	<name>Final Fantasy II</name>
	<desc>This is the fourth entry in the  Final Fantasy series. It was known as Final Fantasy II internationally, because the  second and third games were never released outside of Japan.

The military country of Baron is one of the strongest in the land, with a proud army and a majestic air force known as the Red Wings. But, while their armies are kind and loyal, the recent actions of the King are anything but. The young Captain of the Red Wings, Cecil, is ordered to steal a crystal from a village of innocent magicians, and when he questions the actions of his King, Cecil is immediately thrown out of the country and sent off to kill strange monsters. Little does he realize the price the King's actions will pay, and what the true secret of the crystals, and their powers, truly is...

This is the first Final Fantasy game that introduced the famous ATB (active-time battle) system: during the battles, you have a time indicator for each party member that tells you when this character is able to act. If it takes you too long to select a command for this character, the enemy will act without waiting for your turn. The game abandons the job system that was implemented in the first and the third game in favor of pre-set character classes (paladin, white mage, ninja, etc.) assigned to each party member.

The PlayStation version adds a new rendered intro and ending.</desc>

	<name>Final Fantasy V</name>
	<desc>The Elemental Crystals...the life source of the planet. With them, gentle winds blow, the seas are active, fire burns bright, and the earth is full of life. All seems well in the world, until the wind suddenly stops, the sea begin to grow stagnant, the heat of fire becomes scarce, and the earth begins to wither. King Tycoon, sensing a premonition of evil, hurries off to check on the Wind Crystal, only to witness it destroy itself.

Meanwhile, a young traveler named Butz is camping in a field when a giant meteor strikes the planet. When he heads out to examine the meteor, he is shocked to find a young girl named Lenna, who is the princess of Tycoon, and a old man named Galuf, who is on a critical mission. Later, joined by Faris, a pirate captain, the foursome must travel the land in search of the destructor of the Crystals, and save the planet at any cost!

Final Fantasy V featured many new gameplay options and tactics, including an improved Job/Ability system (like in Final Fantasy Tactics), the return of the ATB (Active Time Battle) turn system, and all of the classic FF gameplay you've come to know and love!

Final Fantasy V was released as a stand-alone game in Japan, and again in Final Fantasy Collection. Its U.S. debut was as part of Final Fantasy Anthology. It was also later ported to the Gameboy Advance, adding 4 new Jobs, a new 30-floor dungeon, a bestiary, a music player, the ability to quick save anywhere, a few extra pieces of equipment, and a newly update translation.</desc>

	<name>Final Fantasy III</name>
	<desc>This is the sixth entry in the  Final Fantasy series. It was called Final Fantasy III because three of the five previous installments of the series were never released outside of Japan.

1,000 years ago, the War of the Magi occurred. People remember it as one of the most horrible tragedies in history. Since the War of the Magi, magic has been all but forgotten, technology began to grow, and people returned to seemingly normal lives. The only true worry people had was the Empire, whose leaders were looking to revive the great force once known as "magic".

But then...something happened that would change the course of history forever...

The Empire had heard word of the remains of a mystical being, known as an "Esper", being found in the mining town of Narshe. Quickly, three soldiers were dispatched to find this Esper and bring it to the Emperor. One of the soldiers, a young girl, triggers a power in the Esper that will begin one of the most dangerous series of events ever. And the only ones who can help her are a rag-tag band of rebels and heroes, whose very hearts and souls are the only ones that can save the world from the mad plans of the Empire.

The game maintains the ATB (active time battle) system of the two previous Final Fantasy games, spicing classic turn-based combat engine with a real-time element. The customization system combines character-specific classes with free-flowing character development. By finding various Espers and equipping them on characters, you can improve their parameters in different ways and choose the magic spells you want to learn for each character.</desc>

	<desc>A remake and expansion of the first NES/Famicom Fire Emblem, Marth must face the betrayal if Hardin and an old enemy he thought long vanquished, the Dragon King Medeus.

Book 1 of the game is essentially a remake of the first NES game. Book 2 continues the story with the same characters.

This game expands the series, however it drops explorable towns and the navigation through a world map which was introduced in Fire Emblem: Gaiden. New features include the ability to dismount the horse and pegasus mounted units, to allow the riders to fight indoors if needed.

At its most simple the story is of Prince Leaf of Lenster's struggle to free his native land from two forces, the Grandbell Empire and the Loptus religion.

Features introduced into this part of the series include fog of war and night maps with limited vision, this requires characters to use torches and wands to light their way. Also the capture command which allowed enemies to be subdued and their weapons taken.

	<name>From TV animation - Slam Dunk SD Heat Up!!</name>
	<desc>Among the most famous Japanese comics of the 90s are definitely Slam Dunk. The manga tells of the running track that will make the young hoodlum Hanamichi Sakuragi who joined the basketball club in Shohoku high school just because initially interested in the sister of the captain Akagi but later this sport will conquer him so much that he becomes a real basketman.

The game is essentially an arcade sports title basketball basically. The main screen there will be little choice given the presence of only three modes: Story mode and classic friendly tournament. In the first we follow the events of the television series whose plot differs slightly from the original one: using Shohoku then we will qualify for the national championship. The second and third but I think there is a need for further explanation.

Executable field operations would also be different, you can also feint shots and blow up their opponents markers. Then successfully accumulating a sequence of 'affirmative action' row (steps succeeded, baskets made or avoided), will fill a horizontal bar at the top of the screen and, as he did a little 'in the playroom with the SNK Street Hoop, pressing simultaneously the three keys will not dorsal (except B), you can make a super nice shooting with supplemental animations depending on the player used.

	<path>./Front Mission (Japan) [T-En by FH v1.0b].swc</path>
	<name>Front Mission</name>
	<desc>In the future, many military forces are dependent on huge mech robots, called Wanzers (Walking Panzers) for combat. At Huffman Island, located in the the pacific ocean, wanzers are deployed by both the USN (United States of the New Continent) and the OCU (Oceana Community Union), who dispute ownership over the island.  One night, the OCU forces stage a covert recon mission on a facility located in Larcus, a USN-held territory and weapons facility. Lead by a soldier named Roid, this mission was entirely unofficial and violated the peace treaty. During the mission, USN forces lead by Commander Driscoll appeared and ambushed the OCU soldiers. During the combat, Roid's fiance, Karen is killed and the USN facility is blown up; placing the blame on the OCU. This became known as the &amp;quot;Larcus Incident&amp;quot; and the OCU denied all knowledge of it's soldiers actions. Ultimately it would be a leading cause to the second Huffman War. 

One year later, the war is underway and Huffman island is under provisional control of the OCU, but with a weakened military unable to defend against USN attacks. The soldiers involved involved in the Larcus Incident have all been discharged and disgraced. Roid spends his time fighting as a gladiator in the Wanzer fighting arena before being approached by a mysterious man. Colonel Olson has found out about Roid's history and wants him to command a mercenary unit he is assembling on behalf of the OCU, dubbed &amp;quot;Carrion Crow&amp;quot;. Convincing Roid that Driscoll is still out there on the island, Roid agrees.

Front Mission is a turn-based strategy RPG played from an isometric perspective. Players progress in the story through large strategic battles involving multiple units and cutscenes between them. At certain places, usually towns, the player can visit multiple locations including bars and shops, and talk to people. Shops are also found to purchase new weaponry, parts and make repairs. In combat, each Wanzer robot is a seperate unit and, has a large variety of weapons and attack styles depending on what's equipped. Units get experience for defeating enemies and also for using various techniques. The more an attack is used, the more powerful it becomes.</desc>

	<path>./Front Mission Series - Gun Hazard (Japan) [T-En by Aeon Genesis v1.01].swc</path>
	<name>Front Mission - Gun Hazard</name>
	<desc>The year is 2064, when the great solar power satellite, ATLAS is overshadowed by the invention of fusion power. The government alliance that had supported the building of ATLAS now find themselves facing economic crisis as the balance of power shifts. In this world of conflict and change, the Walking Panzer, or Wanzer, (a form of mecha) becomes the standard armored unit for wars and petty battles across the globe. For the small nation of Bergen, a coup d'etat is underway, staged by Colonel Ark. Seeking to establish complete control over the government and the NORAD units stationed there, Ark's first step involves the capture of President Orwen. Tipped off to the rebellion, Orwen seeks to flee from Bergen, looking for safe passage out of the seaport of Port Ertothal. A young Wanzer pilot, Albert Grabner, is assigned escort duty to the president by loyal elements of the army stationed there...

Gun Hazard is a side-scrolling version of the Front Mission series. Gameplay is more than a little similar to Cybernator or Metal Warriors. The player moves between different stages on an area map. Once inside a level, the player controls Albert and his wanzer as it moves left, right across the screen. The wanzer is able to jump, and attack with a primary and a special weapon. At any time during a level, Albert can eject from his heavily armed wanzer to explore. Although vulnerable when outside, Albert is able to reach areas the wanzer cannot, in addition to being a smaller target and being able to jetpack indefinitely.

Additionally, Albert can recruit other characters through the normal course of the story, some of whom can be designated to support roles. These support characters when set can provide a variety of different cover fire abilities for Albert during his missions. They too gain experience and levels. Different weapons and armor can be found or bought. Essential components include the Booster ability which allows the wanzer to hover and increase it's jumps, as well as the Dash ability which allows quick left-right movement by the wanzer. Money and experience are earned through the completion of level objectives as well as the kill count of enemy wanzers.</desc>

	<name>Fushigi no Dungeon 2 - Fuurai no Shiren</name>
	<desc>The legend of the Golden Condor... from village to village and  from town to town, everybody speak of it - somewhere, beyond forests and mountains, there lies an idyllic Golden Land, the land of eternal happiness. Many adventurers have tried to find their way to the mysterious land of the Golden Condor, but how many of them have survived the impassable mountain paths, the dark forests and caves, and the vicious monsters? You are the wanderer Shiren, and the goal of your life is to find the Golden Land. Together with your best buddy Koppa, a talking weasel, you decide to venture deep into the dungeons that lead to the land, and to try your luck there.

Furai no Shiren (The Wanderer Shiren) is a roguelike, hack-and-slash game with randomly generated dungeon areas, items, and monsters. Despite being named Fushigi no Dungeon 2 it has no relation to the storyline or characters of the first game in the series, it does however share the same style of gameplay. The movement is turn-based. You visit towns and villages where you can buy and sell supplies. The dungeons are full of various traps and monsters, and sometimes non-playable characters you can talk to, some of which can join you on your quest.

	<path>./Galaxy Wars (Japan).swc</path>
	<name>Galaxy Wars</name>
	<desc>Home version of the 1979 arcade game of the same name. The aim is to launch missiles from the bottom of the screen at enemy spacecraft located at the top. To get there, the missile must pass through a asteroid belt flying across the screen and avoid the shots being fired down from the spacecraft. It is the players job to control the missile. Once launched it can be moved left and right and can be sped up by using the boost to speed it's way out of trouble. Points scored depend on the location of the hit on the enemy spacecraft. The speed at which enemy spacecraft move increases as the number of them decreases. Once all spacecraft have been destroyed, another wave starts, the speed decreases again and the process repeats. A life is lost when a missile is hit by a shot or collides with an asteroid.

Three game modes are available, B&amp;W and Color recreate the graphics and behaviour of the original arcade game in black &amp; white and color respectively whilst Neo mode updates the game with improved graphics and slightly different behaviour. There's also a turn-based two player mode. Other options include changing the number of lives available at the start of a game and the number of points needed for an extra ship.</desc>

	<desc>As you may have guessed from the number 2 in the title, this is the second SNES game in the popular blend of the adventure and jump and run genres which is the Goemon series. Again, you (and your partner, in 2 player mode) control Goemon, his friend Ebisu-Maru and, new to the bunch, robot Sasuke, through loads of action stages and villages. Another new feature comes with 3D boss fights, featuring the giant mech type robot called "Goemon Impact".

	<name>Ganbare Goemon 3</name>
	<desc>Third title in the Ganbare Goemon series of platform/adventure games which cast you as the heroic Goemon as he attempts to save feudal Japan from all sorts of wacky evildoers. This time around, a time-travelling machine threatens all of Japan and thus Goemon and co. must jump into the future to stop the machine.

The game alternates between a top-down world map view in which your characters explore the gameworld and side-scrolling stages in which the main action lies. As in most games of the series there are also loads of mini-games and unique gameplay sequences such as maneuvering Goemon's giant mecha.

The game continues the tradition of bizarre humor unique to the series, you can play as either Goemon or any of his 3 companions, Ebisumaru, Sasuke or Yae with each sporting unique weapons and abilities and also with their own dialogue options and cutscenes, which feature sitcom-like pre-recorded laughs for added wackiness.

	<desc>Fourth title in the Ganbare Goemon series of platform/adventure games which cast you as the heroic Goemon and his gang of wacky adventurers as he fights evil all over Japan. This sequel however, takes the action to outer space as the gang attempts to rescue Goemon Impact (Goemon's giant mecha) from a strange planet.

The game is based around a stage-select hub from which you select which character you want to play as and then attempt to clear the game's many side scrolling stages in standard action platformer fashion, navigating the obstacles and defeating all enemies you run into with your weapons. Since each one of Goemon's allies got stranded on a different planet, you must take control of each one of them in order to clear the stages and recover the special ability unique to each character that must be later put to use to release Goemon Impact. As in other games of the series there are also loads of mini-games and unique gameplay sequences triggered in boss fights, bonus stages and special situations. These involve shooter sequences, racing &amp; sport games and other assorted diversions.</desc>

In Ganbare Daiku no Gensan, you must go through five stages (with two areas each), destroying workers that get in your way using your mallet. You can use it to perform two special attacks. One that sends fireballs going in all directions, and a more powerful one that sends shockwaves, destroying everything on screen.

	<path>./Ganpuru - Gunman's Proof (Japan) (Translated En).swc</path>
	<name>Gunple: Gunman's Proof</name>
	<desc>The year is 1880. Two meteors fell on Earth on a small island near North American Pacific Coast. In the middle of the island there is a small town governed by a sheriff. At first, the town's inhabitants didn't pay attention to the meteors. But then, strange things started happening. Monsters attacked people, and left on the victims' bodies a mysterious crest with one word: demiseed. One day you, a young boy who lives in the town, are contacted by two aliens who came in a miniature space ship. One of the aliens introduces himself as Zero, the Space Sheriff, and explains that an intergalactic criminal named Demi has escaped from justice and is hiding somewhere on the island, being the cause of all the troubles lately. Zero then possesses your body, lends you his powers, and commands you on the quest to destroy Demi and to bring peace to your island and to the alien world alike!

The game is an action/adventure with slight RPG elements (buying and upgrading weapons, etc.) set in Wild West. While featuring traditional dungeon-crawling and many enemies to dispose of in real time combat, the game doesn't equip you with standard medieval swords, but with pistols, shotgun, machine gun, and even a flamethrower. Your weapons have infinite ammo. You can duck to avoid the alien monsters' fire, and perform special attacks with various types of weapons.</desc>

	<desc>One year ago they took from you your wife. Now it's time to pay them back, with interest.

Gekitotsu Dangan Jidousha Kessen: Battle Mobile plays similarly to Spyhunter in both perspective and objective, but your car in Battle Mobile isn't quite as high tech an instrument as that other game's vehicle. You can launch unlimited missiles, but they can only hit helicopters. For ground based targets you must dash into them to ram them off the road. Your car's health is constantly dwindling, even when you're not being attacked by enemies, so picking up the occasionally appearing energy refill items is essential. Shields can be picked up and stored that will make your car invulnerable to all damage for a short while.</desc>

	<name>Genocide 2</name>
	<desc>The world is still recovering from war. The mega-corporation CONEX has been spearheading the rebuilding process, but their true intentions are far from altruistic. By gobbling up their competition, and with the help of new weapons technology, CONEX is on the cusp of controlling the world. Only a hero from the last war can defy them and stop their plans of conquest.

Genocide 2 is a modified version of the PC release. The player takes control of a ten meter tall robotic ninja: the Tracer. Its only form of attack is a sword, but it can hold several extra weapons, and always has access to the Betty. The Betty can be fired in eight directions, returns to the Tracer after being fired, and can block enemy bullets. The objective of each stage is to reach the end, and some stages require you to destroy targets along the way. Any items picked up by the player, or damage done to the Tracer, carries over between stages, and each stage records your fastest time for beating them.

Aside from the visual downgrade, Genocide 2 also lost many minor enemy types and one mid-boss in the transition to the Super Famicom. The first stage was removed, and the first two levels of stage 2 were reversed. The Betty now can only be used for a limited time, and must recharge when its time has run out.</desc>

	<desc>Ghost Chaser Densei doesn't take any dramatic departures from the standard scrolling-brawler plot-line. A city twenty minutes in the future must be saved from a terrorist organization, and between salvation and you is a long, straight line full of goons who must be punched. Aside from receiving orders from your boss before each level, and the quick conversation with a boss or rare NPC, the story won't attempt to get in the way of beat-downs.

There are three playable characters in Ghost Chaser Densei: the martial artist Makai, the mace wielding cat-girl Iyo, and the autonomous robot Belva. Each has unique moves as well as the basic abilities of attacking, jumping, blocking, throwing, and using a special if attack and jump are pressed together. Unlike most brawlers these special moves deplete a recharging special bar, not your health. Makai can throw fireballs and do a flying kick in midair, Iyo can triangle jump and preform a spinning piledriver, and Belva can double jump and preform a grapple special. Characters also have a team up special if playing in two player mode. Enemies range from armored soldiers to lizard men to robots, but most break down into the same hierarchy: weaker types will rush at you while stronger types will shoot projectiles then rush at you. Each level ends with a unique boss with multiple short and long range attacks.</desc>

The angel Tenshi has taken it upon himself to put an end to Ackman's nefarious ways, and sends an army of angels and hired assassins to take out Ackman for good. It's just as well, because Ackman was getting bored without anyone to kill.

Go Go Ackman is a scrolling platformer starring the titular Ackman. Ackman can punch and charge up a ranged wave of energy, and he can also jump on some enemies to stun them before running into them and turning them into a sliding projectile. Ackman can hold up to three bombs that can clear the screen of enemies, and can also hold a weapon, either a sword, boomerang, or pistol, but it will be lost if Ackman is hit. Levels are linear, but do allow some exploration to find weapons and items hidden off the beaten road.</desc>

The angel Tenshi is still determined to end Ackman's nefarious ways, and this time he has enlisted the help of the angelic rock band Metal Angel. Ackman still murders at whim and has his companion Godon collect the souls of his slain, but this time Ackman can keep the weapons he finds, either sword, boomerang, or gun. Each weapon can be upgraded twice, but upgrades will be lost if Ackman is hit or finds a new weapon. Ackman can also now throw smaller enemies, although he can't move while holding them.

But, what's this, it seems there's been a shake up in the chain of command, and now Tenshi is wanted by the Angel Police! Will Tenshi be able to clear his good name? Who's really pulling the strings here? And, most importantly, does Ackman care about any of this at all?

The last of the Ackman games, Go Go Ackman 3 makes very few changes from Go Go Ackman 2, although Tenshi is now a playable character. Both Ackman and Tenshi can be switched between at special points in a level, but they share the same health meter and weapon. Unlike Ackman Tenshi can fly, but as he is an angel he can not collect the souls of enemies he kills. Souls have changed too, and are now used as currency in shops where Ackman can buy temporary powerups or healing. Finally Ackman has lost the ability to slide enemies along the ground, but he can now move while holding a stunned enemy.</desc>

	<path>./Gokujou Parodius (Japan).swc</path>
	<name>Gokujou Parodius</name>
	<desc>Konami's Gradius and space-shooter parody series continues with this second installment.  Gameplay is similar to the Gradius series in that you control a ship that can move anywhere on the screen while the screen itself scrolls from left to right. Enemies appear in waves and destroying all the fighters in a single wave releases power-ups which may be used to choose your ships upgrade. The Upgrade bar too is lifted from Gradius, however each character has different names and functions for their upgrades.

In Gokujyou Parodius, you are now able to now choose from 11 different characters... many of whom appear from other Konami games. They include:

1. Vic Viper: a ship from Gradius

2. Takosuke: the "octopus" of the previous Parodius game, and also seen in at least one Goemon

3. Twinbee: making his appearance from the Twinbee side scrolling games, Twinbee is a squat round robot with a jetpack and a disproportionately big punching glove

4. Pentaro: the original "joke character", Pentaro made an appearence in a previous Gradius title as a flying penguin. However he does star in his own games as well, Konami's Penguin Adventure

5. Hikaru: Hikaru is a girl in a tight fighting "bunny suit" who is riding on top of a missile

6. Mambo: Mambo is a strange looking fish with two horns on the top of his head and on his underside

7. Michael: some kind of fat angel pig. He has wings and a golden halo over his head

8. Koitsu: A blue stick man riding on a surfboard. He's probably one of the more 'normal' characters

9. Goemon: star of the Goemon series of games. Goemon is a ninja warrior equipped with wooden pipes. He flies around in a superman pose for his appearance in Parodius

10. Dracula: star of Konami's Kid Dracula, this white haired squat character retains his vampiric abilities including that of being able to change into a bat

11. Upa: a flying baby. Upa is actually from a Konami game by the name of Bokutte Upa but is probably just more recognizable as "the flying baby" of this crazy shooter

In addition to your player-character, the levels themselves will be full of a strange mix of Konami references, bright colors and the just plain zany. it's not uncommon to have to fly your ship underneath a woman's legs for example or chased by a giant walrus or having enemies shooting cute pink hearts at you.</desc>

Each has slightly different movesets to use on downed or stunned opponents, but each posses the punch, throw, and jump usual for belt-scrolling brawlers. The characters must get past several minor enemies on each level before fighting a stronger boss at the end. Each enemy will drop a cooking ingredient when defeated, and at the end of each level two ingredients can be combined to make a meal that will restore some health based on if the chosen character likes it or not. Environments range from slums and palaces to high speed trains and space ships, but in general there is not much continuity between different areas.</desc>

	<path>./GT Racing (Japan).swc</path>
	<name>GT Racing</name>
	<desc>GT Racing is a Super Famicom racing video game where the player gets to drive a Gran Turismo car in either championship or practice mode.  The game is based on the 1996 Super GT racing season using the horsepower standards and rules of the era.  

During championship mode, the player is asked enter a number, his or her driver's name, and the team name that he or she will use during the championship. The driver's name and team can be entered using either English or Japanese letters. When a player beats a record, he or she is asked to insert his or her number, name or initials (up to four characters and two digits for the number). Championship mode can last for multiple seasons. Playing ninety-nine seasons in a single racing career is theoretically possible due to the double-digit nature of the season information. There are eight different tracks, including the Suzuka Circuit that has been shown in video games since Pole Position II and Fuji Speedway (complete with a virtually photorealistic Mount Fuji in the background).

Versus mode is for two human players only and the record options allows the players to look at his or her previous records. In a race, there are up to fifteen opponents to race against. The player gets rewarded with an opportunity to upgrade his or her equipment after a top five finish on any race course. Bonus equipment includes a faster engine, better tires, and a special dose of nitrous oxide created specifically for Gran Turismo vehicles. All of the bonus automobile parts are automatically installed in the appropriate parts for supercharging the vehicle. Once all the special parts are earned, the automobile is considered to be fully upgraded. The ultimate goal is to win the Gran Turismo championship for his or her team in addition for him/herself.

The "free practice" is essentially a time trial mode where the player races by him/herself for up to ten laps. Acquiring damage is still possible either crashing into walls or through normal wear and tear. The fastest lap time gets captured for the record book just like in the other modes of the game. Before being able to practice freely, the player can also choose the weather condition and the setup of his vehicle</desc>

	<name>Hameln no Violin Hiki</name>
	<desc>In Violinist of Hameln you play the role of Hamel, a sort of wanderer / adventurer whose weapon is a violin. His music can cover enemies in fear, or even control their minds. Hamel and his mascot Oboe arrives at Staccato, a small town attacked by monsters, and drives them away with his power. Impressed, a cute little girl named Flute decides to go with Hamel in order to find and destroy the evil power behind the attacks.

The game is typical platform. You play as Hamel, and with your violin can shoot musical notes to beat your enemies. However, you count with Flutes aid. Flute follows you (although you can order her to stop and stay), but also can be grabbed and thrown at the enemies (yes, thrown at the enemies). Flute can also collect through all the stages some costumes that, when worn, give her special abilities, such as flying, leaping, breaking walls or even explode and kill all in screen. At the end of each stage, of course, youll find the typical boss, all named as musical instruments.

	<desc>Hat Trick Hero 2 is the follow up to Hat Trick Hero, and it is loosely based on the arcade game Hat Trick Hero '93. One or two players can play in a exhibition game (one single match) or in a world league. The game scrolls horizontally uses mode 7 graphics to give the playing field some perspective.

There are 18 countries to select from, each with different running, kicking and technical abilities. You can use 5 different formations, which are 4-4-2, 4-3-3, 3-5-2, WM and libero. You also select a team captain from 8 different characters.

You can perform a foul tackle on the opponent, but when the referee is close enough to notice it you risk getting a yellow or red card. By holding down a direction after shooting the players can shoot the ball with curve effect. During the game a power-up bar is charged which can be used for special abilities. Holding down R allows you to run faster, but this slowly drains the power-up bar. With a fully charged power-up bar you can perform an unstoppable hyper shoot by pressing a special combination, and this drains the power-up bar entirely.</desc>

Cast into the role of a young boy from a remote village, you live a peaceful life until one day the pigs in your village go crazy, and as a result you are thrown underground, only to be saved by mysterious fairies. Something goes wrong, and the world as you knew it doesn't exist any more. You must establish contact to the great gods and other famous characters from the Greek mythology in order to restore the balance.

Like the previous games of the series, this is a standard console-style RPG with turn-based combat viewed from first-person perspective. There is a day/night cycle, which influences not only the appearance of the world map and the towns, but also the schedules of the world's inhabitants.</desc>

	<desc>Similar to the  sixth installment of the series, this is a fighting game along the lines of Street Fighter or Mortal Kombat. It is based on the main storyline of the manga/animé series Hokuto no Ken, also known as Fist of the North Star. 

After a terrible disaster mankind has stopped advancing the technology, and the world became a huge wasteland, controlled by fighter organizations. The main hero, Kenshirou of the Hokuto Shinken school, falls in love with a girl named Julia, who is abducted by one of the Nanto Seiken fighters, Shin.

In battle mode, the player participates in a tournament by choosing one of the characters. 
In free fight mode, the player choses characters as well as the opponents. During battles, the player must first accumulate energy in order to unleash devastating techniques unique to each character.

What he does not know is that the umbrella is magical! The moment he touches it, he is transfered to a parallel universe. Immediately, he is attacked by a huge tank, but a strange old man with a talking bird saves him. It seems that an evil creature named Dondera is threatening the country with the terrible monsters she created. But is it really so? You visit the capital town, talk to the emperor, and decide to investigate the matter...

"Holy Umbrella" is essentially a platform action game, but unlike most other games of this genre, it allows you to visit towns, where you control your hero in a standard RPG-like top-down fashion. You can enter houses, talk to townspeople, etc. On platform levels, which are the main part of the game, you have to switch between the hero, the talking bird Bonto who accompanies you on your quest, and the girl Saki, whom you meet later in the game. Every character has his/her own special abilities and own ways of fighting: the hero can slide through air by using the umbrella, Bonto can double-jump on high ledges, Saki can jump on walls, etc. You use your umbrella as a weapon, as well as elemental stones you can collect on your way and throw at enemies. You also find various power-ups and items you can equip on the hero.</desc>

	<name>The Iron Commando</name>
	<desc>Iron commando is a brawler beat-em-up like Final Fight or Streets of Rage with lots of weapons and big end bosses.

The B-movie story is cheesy and does nothing more than accommodate for the action. From the introduction sequence: "The peril came from outer space. A meteorite entered the earth's atmosphere bringing chaos. After observation, the scientists found that the meteorite was radioactive and had to be destroyed. Unfortunately, terrorists from g.h.o.s.t. want the meteorite too. The Iron Commando's mission is to retrieve the deadly body and avoid genetic mutation."

The player or players walk along the levels beating up enemies. On some levels you ride a motorcycle or jeep, even a mine kart, and shoot your way through hordes of enemies. There are several end bosses, some are screen filling like a helicopter and a giant robot.

Some enemies will drop food, grenades or weapons as you beat them into a bloody pulp. There are lots of different Weapons: 9mm guns, shotguns, machine guns, knives, baseball bats. The weird thing is, enemies that use a sword and even dogs will occasionally drop a machine gun or baseball bat.

	<desc>Jaleco Rally: Big Run: The Supreme 4WD Challenge is a rally racing game and sim in which the player takes part in the Paris-Dakar rally. The game actually begins in Tripoli, Libya and passes through around 2,500 miles of African desert, swamp and jungle on the way to Dakar.Jaleco originally developed the game for the Arcades before porting it to the Super Famicom. This home version was never released outside of Japan. The game was also ported to the Amiga and Atari ST, where it is known simply as Big Run.GameplayIn addition to passing each checkpoint under the required time - the checkpoint system ubiquitous in solo racing games of the era - the player must also be aware of environmental dangers along the course and needs to select a sponsor, navigator and engineer team before starting. They must also balance the weight of their car, as too few replacement parts might cause a problem further into the race yet having too many will greatly reduce the car's top speed.</desc>

Jerry moves by sliding across the ground and can latch on to walls and climb them. Jerry can also jump, stretch out to cling to ceilings, and also move at a faster pace. Jerry can consume balls that he finds during a stage and can then fire them out of his body at enemies blocking his path. Enemies can also be defeated by jumping on them and then flattening Jerry's body on them. Also, there are flowers that contain items for Jerry to collect. Items include life, which refills health, a 1-up that adds an extra life, and a seed, which will grow a climbable beanstalk when planted. If the player collects the scattered letters that appear in every stage that spell out the name Jerry, the player will earn two extra lives.</desc>

	<path>./Jikkyou Oshaberi Parodius (Japan).swc</path>
	<name>Jikkyou Oshaberi Parodius</name>
	<desc>The third in the Paroidus series, it's the same gameplay and zaniness that substantiated the first two games. Gameplay itself is a copy (a parody rather) of Konami's famous Gradius series in that the screen scrolls from left to right (most times) and you maneuver around the screen destroying waves of enemies and avoiding obstacles. Unlike previous Parodius titles, this game contains a difficulty adjustment option, allowing the player to make things easier... or harder. Also unique to this parodius title is a bit of japanese digital voice that shouts out various things at you while you play. Survival throughout the level earns you a boss fight, which frequently includes some of the strangest characters in the game. Make no mistake, this *is* Gradius,  but with all sorts of strange graphics, music and references to other Konami games... So in other words, it's Parodius!

There are now more power-ups than ever including the standard power-up (red, used to upgrade weapons), the shield power-up (blue) and a variety of different coloured bells. Green Bells will make you huge on the screen, Yellow Bells are worth points (points in turn are worth extra lives), Blue Bells are "big bombs" that clear the screen of enemies/shots and can be saved until you need them, White Bells will give your character a megaphone that will shout out japanese phrases, the characters of the phrases themselves can be used to damage enemies (the power of words!), The Red Bell stockpiles you with three point-defense lasers... only one of which can be activated at a time and disappear after a short while. Finally the purple bell will clear the screen of all but the strongest enemies... and will turn them into power-ups.

This time around there are 16 different characters to chose from and the power-ups and weapons that they use are more unique than ever. Several familiar "faces" return and they've brought along friends to share in the party:
Vic Viper: The "gradius ship" appears once again in this gradius parody, equipped with it's traditional gradius weapons
2. Lord British: The "other" Gradius ship and arguably the more famous of the two. Lord British has weapons similar to Vic but quite different also.Missiles and shields work differently for instance. And Lord British uses a Ripple gun instead of a double shot.
3. Pentaro: It just wouldn't be a Parodius game if Pentaro wasn't involved. Originally from Konami's Penguin Adventure, Pentaro retains the same abilities from previous Parodius games... however his Potion weapon may now hit multiple enemies and his normal weapon shots explode against obstacles
4. Hanako: Also from Penguin Adventure, Hanako the penguin is Pentaro's girlfriend. While Pentaro is blue, she is the red penguin. She plays nearly identical to Pentaro with the exception of her S. Bomb weapon
5. Twinbee: Twinbee, from the Twinbee games is another returning Parodius star. Unfortunately he hasn't been upgraded since previous games, so his weapons are nearly identical; Punching Glove Rocket and all...
6. Winbee: Winbee, also from Twinbee is red and has moves identical to Twinbee, except for one difference... when she has 3 Options available, she can power them up to harm enemies that touch them.
7. Tako: Again, it just wouldn't be a parodius game without a flying octopus. And here he is, still wearing a baseball cap, but otherwise unchanged from previous Parodius games.
8. Belial: A yellow female octopus with a bow in her hair, she is identical to Tako with the exception of her Missile and Double weapons... which are instead identical to the Vic Viper.
9. Soitsu: A stickman (now green) surfing aboard a paper airplane, Soitsu plays similar to Koitsu from the previous game, aside from his colour. His laser weapon is able to charge up to deliver more power and he drops little stickmen onto the ground which occasionally dance around rather than attacking. Additionally he has an "upgrade power" (S. Power) that make all his other abilities stronger
10. Doitsu: Similar to Soitsu but with a Double Laser ability. He is an orange stickman riding on a paper airplane and no "upgrade" power, using normal options instead
11. Upa: Upa aka The Flying Baby is back from the previous Parodius game (as well as his original game, Bokutte Upa) and plays nearly the same. Instead of a shield, he has a Mega Crush power that damages all on-screen enemies... and also has an "Upgrade Power" in the form of Grade Up that makes his other abilities stronger.
12. Rupa: Another flying baby (presumably also from Bokutte Upa), Rupa plays similar tot Upa but with a Multi Spread gun which fires missiles in multiple directions (with each upgrade) and a S.Vulcan gun which automatically aims towards enemies.
13. Mike: A cute little kitten who happens to to have a very powerful wave weapon which can travel through obstacles and enemies. Additionally he has a multiple bomb ability which requires his "upgrade ability" (Grade Up) to get really powerful
14. Rani: Another cute kitten (this one rolled onto his bottom facing forward) with very power weaponry. Some of the highlights include a Reflect weapon wherein the shots bounce off of obstacles. Another is the S laser which travels forward but then homes in Up or Down to hit the enemy. And finally, Rani's missile weapon is two homing bells. Rani also has an "upgrade ability" in the form of Grade Up, however it only upgrades the Reflect Shot.
15. Memim: One of the fairy characters, Memim is a female flying girl with standard female bikini clothing. She carries some unique missile weapons however, whose direction is determined by Memim's current location on the screen when fired.
16. Sue: The other fairy with tight clothing, Sue is unique in that her weapons are upgraded/displayed in a different order from everybody else's in the game. For instance her Option is the 4th weapon on the list rather than the 6th... requiring less power-ups to activate it. However aside from that... all of her weapons are the exact same as the Vic Viper's.</desc>

Select your character with his unique stats and movesets, and go at it against any opponent from four fictional leagues with dozens of moves, submission holds and rope maneuvers in or out of the ring.

The game uses pre-rendered 2D sprites and features Vs, Tournament, and League play for up to four players. Also included is a career mode where you create a wrestler and control each aspect of his career up to his final victory in the inter-league tournament. And you can also configure matches to be standard, tag (with 4 or 6 wrestlers), submission or death-matches which adds such features as live wires and explosives to the ring.</desc>

	<name>Jojo no Kimy na Bken</name>
	<desc>One of the earliest titles based on the animé series Jojo's Bizarre Adventures, this game is not a pure fighter, like Capcom's more known title, but an adventure/RPG hybrid with turn-based fights.

In a futuristic world, there lives a young man named Jojo who holds a terrible power within: the power to drain life from enemies. This power is somehow connected to the evil vampire Dio who is terrorizing the world. Jojo must find faithful companions on his quest to restore peace and to master the power within himself.

In this game, you navigate Jojo in an adventure-like fashion, viewing the hero from third-person perspective. You can call up a menu at any time to choose a command such as "Look", "Talk", etc. Being a Japanese adventure, the game doesn't contain puzzles. from time to time, you'll be attacked by enemies and will fight them in turn-based combat viewed from first-person perspective. Jojo and his party members possess the so-called "stands", super-powerful creatures you summon during fights. before each fight, you'll have to choose one of fice available tarot cards to determine the amount of luck and compatibility of the stands you'll have in the game.</desc>

	<desc>Jutei Senki is a turn-based strategy game, never released outside of Japan. The game takes place in an alternate universe where centuries ago humanity and their tree soldiers called Junei fight against Letum, a race of robots powered by magic.

The player commands the human army. The mission in each battle is to defeat the enemy army or take their headquarters in a limited amount of turns. In the human army's main building, the player can recruit new soldiers, but their number is limited. Each unit has its own statistics, including range, speed and attack power. Battles are carried out automatically, with animations on a separate screen.

There are three mission modes which include Campaign, Tutorial, and Expert modes and there is also a two-player versus mode.</desc>

	<desc>Kikou Keisatsu Metal Jack is a scrolling brawler based on the anime of the same name. At the start of the game the player can choose from Red Jack, Silver Jack, or Blue Jack. Red and Silver both have weapons they can find ammo for in levels (a gun and baton, respectively), and all three can do a multiple hit combo or a jumping attack. At the end of a level the Jack will be met by his vehicle which will then merge with his armor. In this form the Jack's attacks are strengthened and he can charge up an attack that hits every enemy onscreen.

There is no story told at any point in the game, so if you want to know what's going on you'll have to track down the anime.</desc>

	<name>Kishin Douji ZENKI: Battle Raiden</name>
	<desc>Once already Chiaki and her reluctant demon servant Zenki have saved the world from the forces of darkness, but apparently once is never enough. Chiaki has a vision of five cloaked figures and knows that only she and Zenki can stop them. At once they set off to track down the demon leaders.

In Kishin Douji ZENKI: Battle Raiden the player takes the role of Zenki. At first, and occasionally through the game, Zenki will be in his powered down form where he can only punch, jump, and dash. After Chiaki recovers her bracelet, or regains her concentration, or whatever she needs to do at the time, she can transform Zenki into his powered up form. In this form Zenki deals more damage and has a much longer list of attacks that get added to as the game progresses, such as a pillar of energy, an electrified punch, and a dashing attack. By picking up scrolls Zenki can do a powerful Rudora attack to all enemies on screen, but this attack damages Zenki as well.

To complete platforming levels Zenki will have to make it to the end of the level while occasionally finding hidden stone monuments that, when destroyed, will drop items as well as alter the level or remove obstacles, allowing Zenki to pass. After a stage's first platforming level is a midboss fight, and after the second platforming level is the boss fight proper.</desc>

	<desc>This game is based on the animé series Villgust. The main hero of the game is Shun, a teenager who lives in modern-day Japan. One day, when he was going back from school with his girlfriend Michiko, Shun noticed a strange red-eyed rabbit. When he tried to follow him, Shun suddenly found himself all alone in a forest clearing. He was immediately approached by a group of four adventurers who said they were members of a group called R.A.G.E. (Resistance Against God of Evil). Apparently, Shun was transported into a parallel medieval world, and an evil organization known as Vile was the one behind Michiko's kidnapping. Shun and his friends will now do anything to help Michiko and to destroy Vile!

This is a traditional console-style RPG. You travel on the world map, visit towns, buy equipment and items, descend into dungeons, and fight random enemies in turn-based combat viewed from a third-person "over-the-shoulder" perspective. The party can hold up to five characters. The characters level up in a standard way, and also get experience and new levels for their magical spells.

	<desc>Another tournament rocks the streets around the Nekketsu High area, and you know Kunio and his gang aren't going to let an opportunity to prove how baddass they are pass them by.

The tournament this time is an eating contest, and the game itself plays like a block-lining puzzle game in the grand tradition of Tetris and Puyo Puyo. You must line-up blocks of the same type as they fall in the classic rectangular play area, clearing them before time runs up or they fill the entire screen. Features a 1P tournament mode, and a 2P competitive Vs mode in which you can chain blocks and send them to your opponent as "attacks" in hopes of causing him/her to lose.</desc>

	<name>Kunio-kun no Dodge Ball da yo: Zenin Shgo</name>
	<desc>16-bit sequel to the cult-classic Super Dodge Ball which unfortunately only saw a Japanese release.

The game continues the "Worldwide Dodge Ball tournament" motif of the original in which several teams from around the world compete in side scrolling dodge ball matches to see which one is the best. Gameplay is similar to other sport games in which you control the character that has the ball at the time (although a lead character always marks the formations and generally controls the team), and special moves can be executed to try and eliminate your opponents (such as homing throws and other esoteric moves). 

This sequel also adds more comprehensive tournament mechanics, for instance your performance in each match allows you to buy power-ups and special moves to enhance your players, you can also create a custom team and manage them throughout the tournament by adding or removing members as you see fit (you can even try to lure players from opposing teams). You can also choose among a series of formations and AI profiles in case you play alone, although you can use a multi-tap to play with up to 4 players.

Available game modes include Tournament, Vs and Mechabutsuke mode which is a variation on Vs that involves a free-roaming court and no outfielders.</desc>

	<desc>You are a boy named Gulliver, who lives together with his two best friends - the girl Misty and the young inventor Edison - in Venice, Italy. The evil Prince of Spain, Judou, is after the mysterious Blue Crystals who grant immense power to those who possess them. Gulliver's father was apparently connected to the secret of the Crystals, and was mercilessly killed by Judou. Now Gulliver swears revenge and embarks, together with Misty and Edison, on a grand journey that will take him to several cities and countries all over the world, from Rome to Himalaya.

The game is an action RPG in which you can switch characters. Each one of the three heroes has his/her own attacks: Gulliver is a melee-style fighter, Edison can throw expendable bombs at enemies, and Misty can attack with magical spells. Whenever you switch to a different characters, the inactive characters in your party gradually regain their hit points. There are no weapons and armor to buy or to find in the game, but the character level up and become stronger from defeating enemies, and collect items those enemies drop.

	<name>Laplace no Ma</name>
	<desc>1924, the town Newcam, Massachusetts. On the outskirts of the town stands the Weathertop mansion. It was just an ordinary place until the last owner, Benedict Weathertop, started practicing black magic. He killed his parents and populated the mansion with all kinds of undead. Since then, nobody dared to approach the mansion. But a short while ago, two boys were found dead near this horrible place. Apparently, the boys had tried to enter the mansion. Another evidence pointed out that a girl followed them - but her body hasn't been found yet, and there is a slight hope she might be alive. 
This is where you, the hero of the game, decide to investigate the mystery, and to venture into the mansion...

"Devil of Laplace" is a hybrid between survival horror and traditional Japanese RPG, similar to the pioneer of this genre, Sweet Home for NES. Unlike "Sweet Home", this game has less puzzles and is more oriented towards RPG elements. You are not stuck in the mansion, but can leave it, visit the town, and buy supplies. Later you also visit other locations such as a castle, etc. The battles are random, turn-based, and are viewed from first-person perspective. The hero of the game can recruit three other characters to the party of five available. Each character (including the hero, to whom you assign gender and class) belongs to one of the five character classes: Dilettante, Medium, Detective, Scientist, or Journalist. Dilettante is an all-around character with defensive magic, Medium is a kind of a black mage, Detective is a melee fighter, Scientist can construct powerful machines to perform various techniques, and the Journalist can take pictures of the monsters, which is the only way to gain money in the game.</desc>

	<name>Lennus II: Fin no Shito</name>
	<desc>This is a follow-up to the game "Lennus", which is know outside of Japan as  Paladin's Quest. The game is set in a world of Andell - a floating continent where ancient prophecies and highly advanced technology co-exist. A curse has fallen onto Andell - its four island, once united, are now separated, and are floating away from the heart of the continent, the temple of Andell. The sages of the temple summon a great hero named Farse, who must find a special magic orb for each one of the islands, which is the only way to re-unite them. Farse embarks on his journey, aided by three Terranos, the big-eared inhabitants of Andell.

This is a console-style RPG where you control a party containing the main hero Farse and three Terranos you select out of the available five. You encounter random enemies and bosses and fight them in turn-based combat viewed from first-person perspective. You can use special attacks and magical spells, which don't consume magic points, but take away a certain amount of your hit points. Instead of healing items, you have mini-bottles you can refill with potions in special places in towns. You can equip various magical artifacts which will allow you to use magic spells belonging to eight different elements.</desc>

	<name>Little Magic</name>
	<desc>May is an apprentice mage at Magic School and must pass the final exam.

A puzzle game seen from a top-down perspective. The goal of each level is to open the exit by pushing a magic stone on a designated spot. May can also push objects one tile ahead without moving herself. This is often used to get the stone over water that she can't cross herself. May's other ability is to create magic bubbles. She can create bubbles in three different sizes. Bubbles will pop after a certain amount of time, depending on their size. If they pop while next to the stone or another bubble, the stone or bubble will be moved one space. Since May can create several bubbles simultaneously, it is possible, and often necessary, to create chain reactions to maneuver the stone into the desired position.

As the game progresses, levels become increasingly difficult and new hazards and enemies are introduced. Enemies follow a set movement pattern and can sometimes be stopped, but not destroyed by magic bubbles. Later levels are made more complicated by different types of tiles including: grass that slows down May, ice that May and the magic stone will slip over, spikes that destroy the stone if it is pushed into them, collapsing tiles that can only be walked over once, rune tiles on which May cannot create magic bubbles, teleporters and others.</desc>

	<desc>In "Live a Live", you control seven main characters and play through seven different stories set in seven different time periods: prehistoric age, medieval Europe, feudal Japan, a futuristic world with robots and weird machines, etc. Those stories appear to have no common points, yet after completing all of them, you'll see they are in fact connected - the worlds of all those characters are threatened by the same ultimate evil force.

The combat features many innovations compared to traditional console RPGs: your position on the battle field is important, and certain techniques can be used only from certain positions, and enemy attacks also affect only specific parts of the field. Out of the seven chapters, some have more battle-oriented gameplay, while others are more devoted to puzzle-solving and information-gathering.

The game is one of the least known Squaresoft products, and was never released outside of Japan.</desc>

Lode Runner Twin: Justy to Liberty no Daibouken is a side-scrolling platform game, adapted for the SNES from the original Lode Runner. However the atmosphere has changed to a lot more cartoonish and happy. Controlling either Justy or Liberty, the player is able to move back and forth, climb ladders, cross ropes and dig holes in some types of surface. The enemies then fall into these holes and the player can walk over them. The goal in each level is to get all the candy.

There is also a battle mode that puts Justy versus Liberty to see who can fetch the most candy.

	<desc>The game is set in the same universe and shares characters and storyline with  Puyo Puyo puzzle games. Unlike Puyo Puyo, Mado Monogatari is a Japanese-style RPG. You play Arle, a five-year old apprentice magician. She is attending a special kindergarten, and it is time for the Final Exam. At the same time, Arle receives a mysterious letter that tells her that if she finds eight magical gems and takes them to the Wizard Mountain, she'll be granted one wish. Arle decides to search for the gems which are scattered all over the world, and to overcome all the obstacles with her great magic power!

The game features random enemy encounters and turn-based combat, which takes place on a platform (Arle to the left, the enemies to the right). You can't perform physical attacks at all, and your only way of harming enemies is through magic. During the game, you learn a variety of magic spells, which can be upgraded later. In battles you can't see your own and the enemies' hit points, and have to act according to your intuition.

Upon leaving an area, the view changes to a larger overworld map showing locations of interest. The battles are viewed from an isometric perspective and the characters automatically engage and perform their actions. While the player does not directly control any of the characters, they can pause the battle at time and assign new strategies (such as melee, use long-ranged attacks or use Magic) to each character. Experience points and gold are awarded after each battle, the later of which can be used to purchase equipment and items.</desc>

	<name>Magic Knight Rayearth</name>
	<desc>This game is based on the anime and manga by manga artist CLAMP.

In the land of Cephiro, the world was kept in peace and harmony by the wishes of Princess Emauraude, the Pillar of Balance. But the evil priest, Lord Zagato, has kidnapped Emauraude, and Cephiro is being invaded by deadly beasts. If this continues, Zagato will gain complete control of Cephiro! The only ones who can stop him are the legendary Magic Knights...

And those Magic Knights are three young girls from Earth. Hikaru Shidou, Umi Ryuuzaki, and Fuu Hououjii have been plucked from modern-day Tokyo and brought to Cephiro by Emauraude, and they're the only ones who can defeat Zagato...as the Magic Knights!

This interpretation of the manga story is a traditional Japanese-style RPG. The player controls the three main heroines as a party; each one uses different weapons and learns various skills. Typically for the genre, the party roams the top-down world, visits towns, descends into dungeons, chats with non-playable characters, and fights randomly appearing enemies in turn-based style.</desc>

With no other choice, Abel vows to save his daughter, no matter what the cost - even if it is his own humanity...

Majyuuou is a side-scrolling platformer for the Super Nintendo, taking influences from Castlevania and Contra. You play as Abel, intent on rescuing his daughter from the depths of Hell. As you defeat certain bosses, they will drop large, color changing gems. Pick up the gem, and you'll transform into either a red Harpy, a blue Dragon, or a green Lizard, depending on what color it is when you pick it up. Each demon type has its own special attacks.</desc>

Peach and Yoshi should have been together with Luigi......but alas, the visage of Luigi was missing. Mario's group of three have separated to find lost little Luigi.

At once, the suspicious sound of an engine was in the air. I wonder what it could be? It was Wario riding his personal plane, the Bulldog, and it dropped a bucket from the sky.

"Whew, woosh!"

And suddenly, the bucket was a snug fit on Mario's head.

"Uwagh, I can't see in this thing!"

The sprite of the woods, Wanda, witnessed it. The petite pixie did not have the strength to remove the bucket on her own, but she desired to help somehow. Thus, Wanda sends Mario a signal with her magic wand, determined to reunite him with Luigi......</desc>

	<desc>Dr. Hell's robot army has destroyed Tokyo, and now only Kouji Kabuto, and the giant robot Mazinger Z, can stop them from taking over the entire world. Animated cutscenes between levels tell the story of the game.

The Mazinger Z comes with a full armory of anti-robot weaponry, from super-powered karate moves to missiles, Breast Fire, and its signature Rocket Punch. Special moves deplete a regenerating energy meter, while Rocket Punches can be preformed at any time, although Mazinger will be unable to punch until its arms return. Each level contains several varieties of enemies, all of them from the show and unique to each level, that must be defeated to progress. Some enemy robots will fire projectiles from a distance while others will rush in attempt to grapple the Mazinger, and sometimes more than one enemy must be fought at once. Enemies will drop healing items and occasionally an item that upgrades Mazinger's Rocket Punch to the Iron Cutter for a limited time. At the end of each level is a fight with a stronger boss robot with more dangerous attacks.</desc>

Your wish is to become a "hunter" - to kill monsters that roam the world and to receive rewards for that. The storyline and the gameplay basics remained unchanged in this remake. You fight enemies in turn-based combat, and use vehicles, such as your own personal tank Mosquito, to transport yourself through different areas, and to participate in battles. You can also buy equipment and upgrade your vehicles.

The remake features enhanced graphics and sound, background pictures for battles (they were black in the original), slightly different locations (more houses in towns, sometimes different layout of the towns and of the world map), and reduced difficulty level.</desc>

Miracle Girls is based on the characters of the manga and anime of the same name. The player starts the game by picking either Tomomi or Mikage, although they both have the same abilities. Either can jump or toss candy, which will render enemies harmless for a few seconds as they eat it. Enemies incapacitated in this way can be used as platforms. Hidden in levels are bombs that fill the screen with candy, turning any onscreen enemies into heart rings, fruit that increase health, and doors that lead to a celestial slot machine that can reward additional lives. At the end of each level is a different challenge with a boss, such as a top-down squirt-gun fight or a game of matching cards.</desc>

	<name>Monstania</name>
	<desc>The hero of the game is Fron, a sixteen-year old boy who lives on the island of Monstania. One day, strolling in the forest, he notices a strange light. The light lead him to a clearing, and then suddenly disappeared. But Fron realized what was the meaning of that light - it was a fairy! Of course, everybody knew that fairies had been long extinct, but Fron never believed in that. All his life he wanted to meet a real fairy, and now, when the opportunity has come, he firmly decides to find her. His girlfriend Tia helps him on the dangerous journey, during which they meet a mysterious little girl named Chitta, and get involved in a grand adventure, that will ultimately lead them to the battle against the dark force that threatens the whole Monstania!

"Monstania" has a somewhat unusual gameplay within the frames of console RPGs. You don't explore the world in the game: it is entirely linear and takes you to the next destination by itself (only at a few points you can choose where to go next by selecting an appropriate answer). Once within the location, you cannot leave it until you complete all your objectives there, which then take you to the next location. The objective is usually a large strategic battle. You navigate your party members on the battle field, attack with melee and long-ranged weapons, and use special technique which require action points. Unlike most other turn-based strategy games, an enemy makes a move immediately after you did the same with one of your characters, without waiting for the "enemy turn". The RPG element is not very significant: your characters level up automatically after each battle. There are also some puzzles to solve in certain locations.</desc>

	<name>Mystic Ark</name>
	<desc>Seven heroes from seven different Worlds. Seven heroes who were brought to a mysterious temple on a remote island and transformed into statues. Seven heroes who are chosen to bring harmony back to the universe: Miriene the witch (wizard), Lux the tetsujin (a race of iron people), Reeshina the grappler (monk), Tokio the ninja, Kamio the ogre, and Mesia the priestess. The seventh hero is you, the protagonist of the game - the knight Remeer or the female warrior Ferris. Your first task will be to release your companions from the statues they are locked in. You must travel to the Cat World and to retrieve an important artifact. But your main objective is to visit all the seven Worlds and to find seven mystic arks - the items that will re-unite those Worlds and bring peace to them.

"Mystic Ark" is a RPG closely connected to 7th Saga. You travel on overworld map, visit towns, buy equipment, and descend into dungeons. The combat is turn-based and viewed from a third-person "over-the-shoulder" perspective. The battles are not random: the enemies can be seen as white dots on your radar, and if you don't want to fight, you can sometimes outrun or avoid them. The game also contains elements of pure adventure: often you must investigate objects closely and use items from your inventory on them.</desc>

	<name>Jaki Crush</name>
	<desc>Jaki Crush is the third game in the Crush Pinball series, with a distinct demon and a horror theme. It is also the only title in the pinball series not released outside of Japan. It is based around the theme of a Jaki, a Japanese type of mythological demon and it contains a single table divided in three levels with six flippers. It can be played with two players (taking turns) and contains an option to alter the ball speed. There is a large amount of moving and stationary targets, and creatures that can be destroyed. There are six bonus stages that are accessed by shooting into a demon's mouth when it is open.</desc>

	<name>Nekketsu Tairiku: Burning Heroes</name>
	<desc>The young fighter Ryu was thrown out of his father's home, and this childhood trauma has been dominating his life ever since. His only wish is to surpass his father and to show him he has become a better fighter than him. Laila is a cheerful treasure hunter. She dreams only of valuable things, adventure, travels, and life in the capital city.  Gaou is experiencing a personal tragedy: he wants to discover the mystery of the disappearance of a woman he loved, Asuka, aided by his best friend Froz. Naaga is a girl who wears a heavy armor, which - as she thinks - will prevent her from losing any battle. At present, she has problems since she owes a million gold pieces to her guild. What do those heroes have in common? As their ways cross, they will find out they are in fact pursuing one and the same goal...

"Burning Heroes" lets you start as either one of the four characters. Each one starts in a different place and is seemingly absorbed in his/her personal quest, but as the game progresses, the four heroes meet each other. You should also find and "unlock" four other playable characters as you advance in the game. The gameplay system of "Burning Heroes" is similar to other console-style RPGs: you fight random enemies and bosses in turn-based combat, viewed from third-person perspective, like in Final Fantasy games. As you get hit in a battle, your "passion" (literally "hot blood", nekketsu in Japanese) level rises, and the more damage you take, the quicker you reach 100%. Once the passion bar is full, you can summon a powerful monster and to unleash a devastating attack on the entire enemy party.</desc>

	<name>Neugier: Umi to Kaze no Kodo</name>
	<desc>You play a man named Duke, the son of Count Wein of Neugier. Long time ago, Duke was exiled from the country by his father. Traveling in faraway lands, Duke heard that his homeland was under attack. He decided to return to Neugier. On the way his ship was attacked by pirates, lead by a mysterious demon named Ord. After he barely escaped the ship, Duke found his way into his father's castle. He realized now that the pirates' attack and the monsters roaming the castle are connected. Although his father doesn't trust him, Duke is determined to save Neugier.

"Neugier" is an action adventure game in which you fight enemies in real-time, slashing them with your melee weapon. You have a "throw chain" ability, which allows you to press objects to the walls, destroying them. You can also push enemies to the walls this way. Duke can also jump and equip armor you find sometimes in dungeons.

	<name>Ou-chan no Oekaki Logic</name>
	<desc>Ou-chan no Oekaki Logic is a digital conversion, with anime mascots, of the classic Japanese newspaper puzzle nonograms. A nonogram is a puzzle on a square or rectangular grid the object of which is to reveal a hidden picture. Along each row and column there is a number or series of numbers which indicate how many squares will be colored in that row or grid. Example; &amp;quot;5 9 4&amp;quot; would mean there would be sets of five, nine, and four colored squares in the grid, in that order, with at least one blank in between. 

Ou-chan no Oekaki Logic adds a story mode where Ou-Chan, representing the player, competes with other blobby anime characters in finding hidden images in the nonogram grids.</desc>

	<desc>All is not well on Yoshi's Island! The devious king Bowser has cast a spell on the island's inhabitants, turning them into his mindless slaves. Only Yoshi has escaped its effects, and so he must set off to free his friends, and to defeat Bowser and break the spell.

Tetris Attack is a fact-paced action puzzler featuring the colorful cast of characters from Yoshi's Island. A stack of blocks continually rises from the bottom of the screen, and the player controls a cursor which can swap any two blocks horizontally. Make a row or column of three or more and they'll clear, potentially creating combos from new blocks falling to take their place. Combos will send large garbage blocks to your opponent, which must be eliminated by clearing a piece that is touching it, turning it into normal blocks.

The game offers a story mode against the computer, as well as a 2-player versus mode, an endless mode, a timed mode where a certain number of blocks must be cleared, and a puzzle mode where a set arrangement of blocks must be cleared in a specific number of moves. The game is based on the Japan-only title Panel de Pon.</desc>

	<path>./Pipe Dream (Japan).swc</path>
	<name>Pipe Dream</name>
	<desc>Each level of this abstract puzzler challenges the player to set up a network of pipes to allow an unspecified substance known as 'flooz' to flow through as many of those as possible. The pieces are offered in random order, and there are seven different types - straight lines going horizontally or vertically, corners rotating in each of the four directions, and cross-over pieces which carry the flooz straight across horizontally and vertically. Each of these can be entered from either side. When the flooz hits a gap, or a piece which the previous piece can't flow into, the pipe is finished.

Before the flooz starts flowing from its randomly-selected starting position, the player has several seconds to start placing pieces. They can be put down anywhere. However a situation that can often occur is there will be a long and complex piping arrangement set up, yet a gap somewhere remains to be filled. Players are able to replace a piece with another in the same square (to make it easier to flow the flooz that way), but for a slight scoring penalty.

Bonuses are awarded for looping the flooz through both sides of at least 5 cross-over pieces, or passing the flooz through every square on the screen. Later levels have some squares on the grid blocked off, a few gaps in the side-wall (allowing flooz to thread to the other side of the screen). After every four levels there is a bonus game for points, in which the player can only place the pieces in the lowest open space in each column, similarly to the board game of "Connect 4".</desc>

	<name>Popful Mail</name>
	<desc>In this platform action game, you play as a cute bounty hunter known as Popful Mail. While you might think that a cute Anime chick would have no trouble making a living slashing bad guys with her sword, Popful is having a hard time making ends meet.  One day, however, Popful learns about a magician who has gone rogue and has a hefty bounty on his head. So, her adventure begins as Popful fights her way through a new adventure, and makes new friends along the way.

Primarily this is an action game with very slight RPG elements. As you make your way through the plethora of levels, you will have to collect money from slain foes. You use this money in the shops to buy weapons, armor, health, and so on. Also, this game features interaction with many, many characters through both on-screen dialog and fully animated sequences. Some of these characters become playable as you progress through the game.

This release has the same story and general gameplay style as the earlier version, but otherwise was made from scratch, having entirely different graphics, locations, enemies, challenges, etc.</desc>

	<path>./Ranma 1-2 - Akanekodan Teki Hihou (Japan) (Translated En).swc</path>
	<name>Ranma 1/2 : Hidden Treasure of the Crimson Cats</name>
	<desc>The game is based on the animÃ© series Ranma 1/2. It tells the story of the young martial artist Ranma Saotome. Traveling with his father Genma across China, Ranma discovered a cursed spring. When he and his father fell into that spring, they were both transformed: Ranma into a little girl, Genma into a panda bear. Hot water restored them to their original appearance, but whenever they are splashed with cold water, they turn into their "cursed" forms. 

The story of the game begins as Ranma and Genma are having breakfast by their friends. Suddenly, several cat-like creatures burst in and kidnap Genma. Ranma finds out that the cats belonged to Akaneko (Crimson Cat) Gang, who kidnaps strong fighters for some reason. Soon Ranma discovers that Kamusaru, the leader of the Crimson Cat Gang, is looking for an ancient treasure that will allow him to turn into a Nekomaou (Cat Demon King), and take over the world. Ranma and his friends will do anything to rescue Genma and to stop Kamusaru's evil plans!

The game features many characters from the animÃ©, including Ranma's fiancee Akane, the fighter Ryouga, the amazon warrior Shampoo who is in love with Ranma, and others. The game is built like a traditional Japanese RPG: your party fights random enemies in turn-based combat viewed from a third-person, Final Fantasy-like perspective. In battles, you can attack physically, or use various offensive and defensive techniques, which consume "ki" (an equivalent of magic points). Not only Ranma and Genma, but also the other characters in your parties can take a different shape. You carry around a bucket of cold water, and every time you use it on one of your characters, he/she is transformed into a "cursed" form. This is sometimes required to advance the story of the game (for example, Ranma can enter a certain location only as a girl).

	<name>Ranma 1/2 : Hard Battle</name>
	<desc>Another fighting game based on the Ranma 1/2 manga series set around the misadventures of a martial artist that gets cursed and magically transforms into a female version of himself whenever he's splashed with water.

As in previous games the premise simply involves the cast of the series going at each other's throats for ultimate supremacy, although this time you can select any character in either the single player or Vs gameplay modes.

The gameplay itself involves controlling your character in a side-scrolling arena and trying to defeat your opponent either with your basic attacks, special moves (triggered by specific controller motions) or super moves that require you to charge buttons and can only be dealt under specific situations (ie, when your life-bar starts flashing), while avoiding your opponent's attacks in turn.

	<name>Ranma 1/2 : Chougi Ranbu Hen</name>
	<desc>A 2D one-on-one fighting game based on the Ranma 1/2 manga series dealing with the adventures of a male martial artist cursed to transform into a female version of himself when splashed with water.

Ranma 1/2 : Chougi Ranbu Hen pits 12 characters from the series (including the male and female versions of Ranma) against each other in best 2-out-of-3 rounds matches, with the goal being to defeat all the opponents and thus claim a magical lucky cat that will grant the champion whatever he wishes.

Gameplay involves controlling your character in a 2D scrolling arena, in which you attempt to defeat your opponent by using your basic attacks and special moves, all the while avoiding your opponent's strikes. You can also charge up your character until he reaches "super" mode, which allows you to unleash super moves for extra damage, but performing any basic attack negates the super mode.

Features the standard single player and Vs modes along with a Tag Team Vs mode in which two players select a pair of characters and can exchange them in mid-fight for strategic advantage.</desc>

	<path>./Ranma 1-2 - Ougi Jaanken (Japan).swc</path>
	<name>Ranma 1/2 : Ougi Jaanken</name>
	<desc>The game involves falling blocks of hands displaying the rock, paper, and scissors signs, which fall three at a time. In a similar manner to Tetris, the player can rotate the blocks to stack them, using pieces that defeat other pieces (e.g. paper over rock) to eliminate stacks. Doing so adds garbage pieces onto the opponent's screen to make it more difficult for them to eliminate their stacks of blocks. The objective is to fill up the opponent's screen up with blocks so that additional ones can no longer fit. Each character has two special attacks which can be used when large combinations are completed. Once in each round each player can also use a bucket of water that can transform a cursed character into their alternate form, which weakens their attacks until the effect wears off. This does not affect Akane or the Gambling King.</desc>

Starting with only a single shot,  5 different upgradable weapon systems can be collected as extras. Upon death, the last activated system loses one increment of its current upgrade status, but can be refueled by additional extras collected. Every weapon has also a massive 'smart' bomb feature, wiping out mostly everything on screen at once if invoked. There are also some R-Type style space shooter levels thrown in for good measurement. Very arcady with tons of action. Several boss monsters per level. Level progress is saved via password feature.

But remember, Dr. Wily is mad, but he's not stupid. He had a backup plan...and all he had to do was just wait...

6 months had passed, and somewhere from deep within Wily's abandoned lab, 4 hidden capsules activated and opened. His backup plan was in action...he had hidden 4 new Wily Robots that would spring him out of jail so he could continue his mad reign.

When Mega Man hears the word that Wily was busting out of prison, he rushes onto the scene, only to encounter a strange robot he had never seen before named Bass. Bass tells Mega Man to back off, that he would stop Wily, and that Mega Man was no longer needed.

Think that's gonna stop Mega Man? No way! Mega Man takes off to put a stop to Dr. Wily and find out exactly whose side Bass is on...</desc>

	<path>./Romancing SaGa (Japan) [En by Trans Dimension v0.40] (Incomplete).swc</path>
	<name>Romancing SaGa</name>
	<desc>Once upon a time, three evil gods fought against the holy gods, and the holy God-Father chose a human warrior to help them. Finally, after a prolonged, terrible war, the leader of the three evil gods - Death, the eldest of them - surrendered. The youngest evil god, Schirach, became a human and has lost her powers. The middle one, Saruin, was sealed away in the dark world. Now, after thousand years have passed, and the seal of Saruin has weakened, it is time for you, the hero of the new generation, to defeat him.

Romancing SaGa is the fourth installment in the long SaGa series - non-linear role-playing games with several main heroes. It is the first of three Super Nintendo entries. The first three games in the series were on the Gameboy and were known as "Final Fantasy Legend" outside of Japan. In this game, you play the stories of eight characters, which will later unite to face the ultimate evil. The eight characters belong to different classes and have different abilities. There are four male characters (noble son, thief, adventurer, and pirate), and four female ones (nomad, ranger, dancer, and savage). The combat is turn-based, with enemies visible on screen. Taking a cue from Final Fantasy II on the NES, instead of "Leveling" your character as a whole you level specific abilities such as a type of weapon or magic, as well as, stats such as HP and Strength and Intelligence. New to this entry abilities are randomly unlocked during battle as a light-bulb appears over the characters head and the new ability is unleashed to the surprise of friend and foe. This serendipitous element of gameplay along with the multiple heroes to choose from greatly enhance the replay value as no two playthroughs are alike. Which is good considering the steep learning curve of the SaGa games which require multiple playthroughs to truly master the system.

"Romancing SaGa" was never released outside of Japan until the Playstation 2 remake "Romancing SaGa: Minstrel Song"</desc>

	<desc>Every 300 years the Death Eclipse kills all newly born creatures. Men, women, and children, animals and plants, even ferocious monsters - no one can survive the devastation caused by the Eclipse. No one except a child chosen by the destiny. 600 years ago, such a child survived the Death Eclipse, only to become a demon king. During the next Eclipse, a chosen child became a holy king, and he defeated the evil demon king. Now, when the next Eclipse is nearing, nobody knows who the next fortunate survivor will become - a demon or a holy man?

In "Romancing SaGa 3", you can play through the story controling any one of the eight main characters - Julian, Monica, Mikhael, Harid, Katarina, Thomas, Elena, and Sarah. The story is common for all eight characters, and they often join together and share the same piece of a story. The princess Monica learns about a rebellion planned by a treacherous Baron to dethrone her brother, Marquis Mikhael. She goes to warn him, but on her way, she loses her horse, and has to stop in an inn of the town Shinnon. There, she meets travelers who agree to lend her a horse and accompany her to see her brother. When they finally reach Mikhael, a war begins...

"Romancing SaGa 3" has a refined upgrading system: you can upgrade your weapons and your spells by using them continuously. The party combat is turn-based, and there are also strategic army-vs.-army battles you'll have to command.</desc>

	<name>Rudra no Hihou</name>
	<desc>The Earth is ruled by heavenly powers, who destroy it and create it again every 4000 years, to end the live of powerful races and to let new ones appear. Many years ago, four great races dominated the Earth: the wise Danans, the beautiful Mermaids, the proud Reptiles, and the strong Giants. But those races had to give place to a newly born race: the humans. During the era of the humans, the planet's air has become filled with smog and the water dirty with pollutants. The cult of the Rudra have appeared and begun fortelling the end of the world. As the 4000 year deadline approaches, three characters each embark on their separate yet intertwined quests.

Sion is a young warrior who wants to take part in a ritual tournament and become the strongest of the kingdom. However a capture of one of the Cultists of Rudras soon complicates his training.

Surlet is a wise magician who is interested in archeology and history of the Earth. He is also a pupil of the famous professor Muench who recently made a very important discovery regarding ancient ruins

Riza is a young druid who lives with her grandfather in a quiet village. She was born with a mysterious jade on her forehead, and now feels the urge to save the world from an inevitable, yet unknown disaster.

Rundra no Hiho is a turn-based RPG, similar in gameplay and graphics to the better known Final Fantasy VI. Whenever players load the game cartridge, they are able to choose which of the three characters they wish to play. This allows any one of these quests to be saved and put aside for any amount of time, allowing the player to change between characters as they so desire. Regardless of which character is chosen, the game is displayed as a top-view on the overworld and in towns. Players can move around to different locations, search treasure chests and talk to townspeople. On the overworld and in dungeons, random encounters can occur. During battles the game is displayed from a side-view and is turn-based between the player's characters and monsters. Players are able to Fight with their weapon, use mantras (magic), use items, defend or run away. Defeat of monsters will result in the party earning experience points and money, which can be spent to buy new weapons, armor and items.

The game's mantra (magic) system is unique in that all spells are formed up of syllables, each with it's own effect (for instance, the syllable "Ig" represents fire and the syllable "ga" augments any mantra's power over it's basic form. Therefore "Igga" is a more powerful version than "Ig" alone). Syllables must be arranged in proper combinations in order to form effective magic spells. Hints towards some of these combinations can be found inside treasure chests or by talking to townspeople.

	<name>Art of Fighting 2</name>
	<desc>In this sequel to the original Art of Fighting, and prequel to the original Fatal Fury, we learn that Mr. Karate, the final boss of the original game, behind the mask, is really Takuma Sakazaki, Ryo and Yuri's father, that Takuma was being used by Geese Howard for his own evil intentions, and that Mr. Big was the one who had originally kidnapped Yuri.

Many of the problems that existed in the first game have been fixed in this installment (it is easier to execute special moves, you no longer have only Ryo or Robert to choose from in 1 player mode, etc.).

The entire cast from the first Art of Fighting is here (with the exceptions of Todo and Mr. Karate), along with a few new characters: Takuma Sakazaki, Ryo and Yuri's father; Yuri Sakazaki, Takuma's daughter and Ryo's sister; Eiji Kisaragi, a sworn enemy of the Sakazakis; Temjin, a Mongolian trucker; and a younger version of Geese Howard, whom you face as the last boss if you beat the game without losing a round.</desc>

	<name>Seiken Densetsu 3</name>
	<desc>Seiken Densetsu 3 is set in the same world as the two previous Seiken Densetsu games (the first is Final Fantasy Adventure, and the second is most known as Secret of Mana). The mysterious power of Mana is also the center of all events in Seiken Densetsu 3. Years have passed, and all the destructive powers of Mana have been securely sealed by Mana Swords into eight seeds, all placed in eight different kingdoms. But some people know about those sealed powers, and they don't want to free them for the sake of humanity, but for their own gain - such as the kingdom of Altena, which is slowly freezing and which can be saved only by the legendary powers.

The game features several plot lines connected to each other by their common background. In the beginning of the game, you are offered to choose a group of three among six different characters of different classes: Duran the Fighter, Angela the Magic User, Lisa the Amazon, Carlie the Cleric, Kevin the Grappler and Hawk the Thief. Each one of them has her/his own background story and dwells in a different land. Gradually, the connections between those different characters become apparent, and the seemingly loose story lines are connected into a whole.

Seiken Densetsu 3, like the previous game of the series, is an action RPG, with real time combat.</desc>

	<desc>A 2D side-scrolling beat 'em up, Sengoku casts you and a friend as two renegade fighters out to beat the crap out of the many assorted gangs that threaten the post-apocalyptic cities of the future. Unfortunately for them they also get caught in a time-warping scheme caused by the evil Nobunaga who attempts to invade the time period with mythical warriors and evil creatures from the Japanese sengoku period.

The game thus takes you from the city to a spirit-realm from time to time, in which you must fight all sorts of Japanese mythical figures, and release three haunted spirits that can aid you in your battle. Collecting orbs from defeated enemies allows you heal up, gain weapons and even energy attacks and also summon the warrior forms of the spirits you released, which change your character's form and give you a new collection of attacks and powers.

	<name>Shin Megami Tensei</name>
	<desc>A young man lives together with his mother in Kichijoji, a district in modern Tokyo. One day, he has a strange dream: he is being sucked into another dimension, a strange maze-like structure. A spirit appears in front of him and asks him his name. As he proceeds further, he meets a man who is hanging on a cross, another one who is being tormented by a demon, and a mysterious young woman who is bathing in a pool...

"Wake up!" - the voice of his mother cuts through the dream. The young man wakes up and checks his computer. Suddenly, a message arrives: the world is headed towards destruction. Only he who can summon demons through a virtual space will be able to prevent a disaster. What could that mean? The young man goes outside and finds out a murder has occurred in the nearby park. The district must be cut off from the rest of the city until the murderer is found. This was the beginning of the demon summoner's story...

"Shin Megami Tensei" is a first-person RPG set in modern-day and futuristic Tokyo. The hero of the game can summon demons, who use a mysterious energy called Magnetite. The demons can fight for you and perform other useful tasks. The first-person combat is turn-based. In the beginning of the game, you can set the statistics of your party members, determining their strength, stamina, intelligence, etc. You'll need to make some crucial decisions during the game, that will also influence the outcome of its events.</desc>

	<name>Shin Megami Tensei II</name>
	<desc>Shin Megami Tensei II is a direct sequel to the  first game. The events of this game take place 20 or 30 years after the hero of the first game followed the neutral path, defeated the Asura Lord and the seraph Michael at the Cathedral, and founded a state where followers of both Law and Chaos ideals could live freely. But his reign of freedom doesn't last long. The Mesia faith gains power, expanding the Cathedral into a new enclosed environment named Millenium. The Gaians rise up, but their rebellion is repressed by the Mesians' elite warrior class, the Temple Knights. Some years later, a retired arena fighter Okamoto discovers a man fighting for his life against a demon. He rescues the man, who doesn't even remember his own name, and trains him to fight in the arena so they might both go on to a better living in one of the upper-class areas of Millenium. And thus the new battle for a better future begins...

"Shin Megami Tensei II" features all the gameplay innovations of the previous game. You can summon demons, fuse them, make them battle for you, talk to random enemies and receive information from them, etc. The combat is turn-based, and you explore the dungeons from a first-person perspective view.</desc>

	<name>Shin Nekketsu Kouha Kunio-kun: Kunio-tachi no Bank</name>
	<desc>Another beat 'em up in the Nekketsu Kouha Kunio-Kun series. 
The eternal rebel Kunio and his pal Riki finally get to face the long arm of the law when they get both arrested for killing a couple of bystanders in a hit-and-run incident. Problem is they are innocent and the lookalike killers are still out there! Kunio and his pal now have to break out of the prison and go kick some butt in the name of justice (and to clear their names of course).

Gameplay involves defeating all opponents using your arsenal of attacks and special moves (as well as any weapons you may find around) and completing the many side scrolling stages that make up the game, usually after beating an end level boss.

Kunio and Riki are not alone in their quest, as their hard boiled girlfriends, Misako and Kyouko, can join up and provide their unique collection of special moves to the mix. Biking sequences in which you try to get to another part of town while fending-off opponents Road Rash-style are also added for additional gameplay and the game uses several non-interactive cutscenes and dialogues to carry the plot forward.</desc>

	<name>Shounen Ashibe</name>
	<desc>Shounen Ashibe: Goma-chan no Yuuenchi Daibouken (lit: "Boy Ashibe: Goma-chan's Great Amusement Park Adventure") is a Super Famicom platformer from Nova Co. and Takara. The player alternates between controlling the human Ashibe, as he escorts his friends across a world map while talking to NPCs and following the game's story, and the seal Goma-chan in 2D platformer stages where he must track down eight items by investigating his surroundings thoroughly. While Goma-chan can't be hurt by enemies, colliding with them causes him to lose one of the eight items he's already found - as the stages have a strict time limit, it's best to avoid this situation whenever possible.

Shounen Ashibe was originally a Shounen Jump serialized manga before becoming an anime TV series in 1991, a year before this game was released.</desc>

	<desc>Shounen Ninja Sasuke ("Boy Ninja Sasuke") is a comedic brawler published by SunSoft exclusively for the Super Famicom. The player, as the eponymous ninja, must rescue the daughter of a local lord by fighting his way through hordes of masked bandits led by a mysterious warlord. A second player can join in as Sasuke's monk friend Chin-nan. The game has a distinct sense of speed and verticality, and it's recommended that the player(s) try running and jumping around performing aerial attacks rather than staying on the ground and getting quickly swarmed by enemies.The game was published by SunSoft and developed by an unknown developer, though Mint is thought to have contributed to its sound design. A US SNES localization, with the title Boy Ninja Sasuke, was briefly considered but then axed.</desc>

	<path>./Slayers (Japan) (Translated En).swc</path>
	<name>Slayers</name>
	<desc>"Slayers" is based on an manga series of the same name (also known as Lina the Teenage Sorceress). The heroine of the manga (and of the game) is Lina Inverse, a seventeen-year-old girl who can use magic and is also proficient with the sword. Lina particularly likes money, and often robs rich people and hunts for treasure. She also has a sense for justice - if a village or a town is in trouble, Lina will do anything to protect it and to fight the bad guys! In the game, Lina is knocked down after a fight against mysterious attackers, and is found by the inhabitants of the nearby village. The trouble is, she can't remember anything! When she meets her long-time companion Naga, their first objective become to investigate the goblin attacks on the population, but Lina's ultimate quest is to regain her memory and to find out who or what has attacked her.

The game is a traditional console-style RPG with towns, dungeons, random enemies, and turn-based combat viewed from first-person perspective, in a Dragon Warrior fashion. The characters can attack physically or use special attacks. Lina can also cast various magical spells. You cannot travel on the world map, but "jump" to various locations instead. The game features animé-style cut scenes.</desc>

	<desc>The game is a less of a self-contained game and more a collection of four smaller ones; including a point-and-click segment featuring Schroeder. The player controls Woodstock and direct Snoopy as he performs all sorts of errands for different Peanuts characters. The player does a separate game for each character; some of them require him to do a little detective work, or to direct Snoopy to win a race, or to get a character to some place. The ultimate goal in the game is to get everyone in shape for Snoopy's concert. Games can either be played using stereo or monoaural sound.

The music was composed by Hirokazu Tanaka (?????)[2] and Minako Hamano (??????),[2] in addition to arrangements of the familiar works of Vince Guaraldi known to longtime Peanuts fans. Many years later the game has been translated to English (by Aeon Genesis) and Portuguese.</desc>

	<desc>A puzzle spin-off title from the Ganbare Goemon series. Goemon has been captured and his friend Ebisumaru goes out to try to find and rescue him. In order to do so, he must traverse a series of maze-like levels avoiding obstacles and enemies and get to the end zone.

The game is played from an isometric perspective from which you can get a good view of the mazes and Ebisumaru. You have no direct control of Ebisumaru per se, but instead switch special blocks around the mazes that can change Ebisumaru's direction of travel and such. You must reach the end of each stage before time runs out, and get all the power-ups and items laid in each maze in hopes of getting to Goemon alive.</desc>

They belong to respectable families of warriors and healers, and excel in battles kills. One day, a letter from a neighbor town arrives. A strange disease has plagued the town and its inhabitants plead the healers of Clatos to help them. Milly's father decides to go, but he himself catches the disease.

But in the beginning of their journey, they discover a crashed space ship with people who belong to a much more advanced civilization.

	<name>Super Aleste</name>
	<desc>Compile's Aleste series lands on the SNES with the appropriately named Super Aleste. Taking the role of a lone starfighter pilot, you are tasked with destroying an evil alien armada in standard 2D shooter fashion. And while you may be alone, you certainly won't be underpowered, with eight different types of weapons, each having six power-up levels for a grand total of 48 firing modes (not counting bomb power-ups) Super Aleste boasts one of the largest arsenals in 2D shooter history.

Gameplay is single-player only with 3 difficulty levels. Also included is a short campaign with different levels that plays mostly like a "survival" mode with the objective being to outlast the time limit and rack the most points.

	<name>Super Fire Pro Wrestling - Queen's Special</name>
	<desc>Long before the WWE introduced the Divas wrestling matches, in Japan there was a more serious affair, where wrestling skill was more important than breast implants, and matches were "real" (as far as wrestling goes) instead of pillow-fighting or bra and panties fights.

In this game in the Fire Pro Series, the cast of the All Japan Women's Pro-Wrestling promotion are available, all fighting to win the Red belt, the highest prize of the federation. It's also possible to fight in single matches, tournaments, Battle Royal and Elimination matches. The usual array of options in CAW is present, being possible to create 16 new Wrestlers.

Gameplay, as usual is the series, is dramatically different than in most western games. Each wrestler has a bunch of moves, ranked from weak to strong. While it's possible to connect any of them from open situations, while grappling only when the opponent is already beaten the most powerful moves can be successfully used.

	<name>Super Fire Pro Wrestling Premium X</name>
	<desc>In this final appearance of Fire Pro series on 16-bit consoles, the usual roster of over 150 wrestlers from several wresting promotions worldwide including several styles from Shoot or Pancrase to American and Lucha are joined by 80 Create-a-wrestler slots, plus secret wrestlers such as legends Gotch or Thesz or the roster of Blazing Tornado. While all fighters have fictional names, a lot of them are perfectly recognizable by their attire, stance and style. The CAW mode allows the player to create a wrestler from scratch, setting how they look (choosing face, size, clothing and setting colours) and fight, with several styles and stances available, as well as over 500 moves, each more suitable for certain styles and skills. To make them fight more realistically when controlled by the AI, the CAW mode also allows one to set move priorities.

Five game modes are available, including World Championship (single and tag), Battle Royale, 5-man Elimination Mode, League Battle and the One Night Dream Match. There are several referees available (each with their own quirks) and variant rules, from allowing fighting outside the ring without count-out (or disallowing it) to the disabling of disqualifications from illegal moves.</desc>

	<name>Super Nazo Puyo - Rulue no Roux</name>
	<desc>A spin-off of the successful action puzzle series Puyo Puyo with a twist. Whereas the main Puyo Puyo games are aimed at defeating AI or human controlled opponents in puzzle duels (where each player has his own play area in which color-coded "puyos" fall and must clear them out faster than his opponent). Nazo Puyo instead challenges the player with different single-player scenarios in which a specific objective must be completed (such as clearing only the red Puyos, or performing a specific sequence of combos, etc.).

The game uses the mold of a top-down RPG in which you control the young magician Arle as she explores towns and dungeons in her search for adventure. Each quest involves finding an NPC who will trigger one of the aforementioned scenarios and rewards Arle with experience points and unique items that increase her stats.

	<desc>Sequel to the original Super Nazo Puyo, SNP2 is a Puyo Puyo spin-off which combines arcade puzzle elements with RPG gameplay.

You play as the young magician Arle as she sets out looking for adventure all over the land, chatting with NPCs and exploring the game world via a standard top-down RPG interface. Quests involve careful exploration and solving Nazo Puyo challenges which involve specific scenarios of puzzle-based gameplay which the player must solve under a specific timeframe. These sequences give the player a play area in which color-coded "puyos" are pre-arranged in different patterns, and the player must position and arrange the ones that start to fall in order to fullfil the objective at hand (clear only a certain row or color of puyos, reach a certain number of combos, etc.). Additionally, running into specific monsters can trigger standard Puyo Puyo duels, in which both players have their own play areas and the objective is to clear the screen faster than the opponent.

	<desc>Super Sokoban (or Soukoban) is a puzzle game in which the player must push crates around a maze to their designated storage area, ensuring they do not accidentally push a crate into a position where it cannot be recovered. Thinking Rabbit created the original game in 1982 on home computers, and Super Sokoban is the first Super Famicom game to follow the same blueprint.

The intro establishes that the eponymous Sokoban, or warehouse worker, must perform enough box-pushing puzzles to earn enough cash for a flashy new car so that he might finally impress the girl of his dreams.

An added wrinkle is that each stage has a fixed move limit, and so the player must not only push the boxes in the right order but do so with maximum efficiency. The game was not released outside of Japan.</desc>

	<name>Super Tetris 2 + Bombliss</name>
	<desc>Super Tetris 2 + Bombliss is one of the many versions of the famous soviet puzzle game, the first one available for the Super Nintendo, and an updated version of Tetris 2 + Bombliss.

As the title would suggest, the game features both standard Tetris as well as another similar game called Bombliss. Tetris offers three game modes: standard marathon (A-type), start with garbage (B-type), and rising garbage (C-type). There is also a two-player versus mode where clearing rows sends garbage to the other player.

Bombliss is slightly different from normal Tetris. Arranged on the board and in some dropped pieces are bomb squares. Completing a row does not clear the blocks in the row, but will trigger any bombs in the row which will destroy blocks. Different sizes of bombs will generate larger explosions. Bombliss is offered in standard marathon mode, a puzzle mode where a set board must be cleared using set piece drops, and a 2-player versus mode.</desc>

	<name>Super Tetris 3</name>
	<desc>Super Tetris 3 is yet another version of the famous soviet puzzle game. However, despite what the title may suggest, contained within are actually four different versions of Tetris: Tetris Classic, Familiss, Sparkliss, and Magicaliss. Tetris Classic, of course, is the basic version of the game, which comes with an endless mode and a 25-line "standard" mode. Familiss, as the name might suggest, is a family mode for up to four players simultaneously. Sparkliss, meanwhile, is very similar to Bombliss from Super Tetris 2, only with a medieval fantasy theme and different explosion patterns. Sparkliss includes both a stage mode and a puzzle mode.

The most unique mode is Magicaliss, which has never shown up on any other version of Tetris. In Magicaliss, pieces come in three basic colors, and by rotating the piece, the player can choose between them. Creating a line entirely out of one color will clear all blocks on the screen of that color. There are also grey pieces, which can only be cleared by creating a line made entirely from one color, which will cause all grey blocks on screen to become that color. There are also rare rainbow pieces which will act as any color. Besides these additions, the game itself is basic Tetris.

Tetris Classic, Sparkliss, and Magicaliss can also be played in a two-player battle mode, besides the four-player Familiss mode.</desc>

	<name>Tales of Phantasia</name>
	<desc>In "Tales of Phantasia", you play a young boy named Cless, who lives together with his parents in a quiet village. It was a day like all the others when Cless decided to go hunting with his best friend Chester. Chasing a wild boar, Cless discovered a strange talking tree in the forest who was pleading him for help. But as soon as it stopped speaking, the two friends heard the sound of an alarm. They returned to the village and found it burnt down, and all its inhabitants murdered. Before Cless' mother died in his arms, she told him this terrible massacre had something to do with the pendant she and her husband gave Cless for his birthday... what connection could there be? Cless decides to visit his uncle who lives in another town, but he doesn't realize his journey will take him to much more remote places than that!

"Tales of Phantasia" presents a unique combat system: The battles have a lot in common with fighting games: you fight on a platform that slowly scrolls forward and have to attack your enemy in real time. Other party members are controlled by AI. You can pause the game at any time and use magic, items, or choose an overall strategy for your allies.</desc>

	<name>Tenchi Muyou ! Game-Hen</name>
	<desc>Sasami is kidnapped by a mysterious little girl with magical powers, and Tenchi and his companions must travel to rescue her, battling monsters and other creatures on the way.

Tenchi Muyou! Game-Hen is a strategy game with RPG elements, based on the popular Japanese Tenchi Muyo! cartoon series. The game moves from battle to battle, with the plot being revealed through cutscenes between them. The player fights the computer on turns, controlling the individuals from a party of four. The party members are selected on a separate screen before each battle, and as the game progresses new characters become available.

During the skirmish, selecting the characters brings up a menu with three command options: move, attack or end turn. A fourth transform option becomes available later, after they reach a higher level. When moving or attacking, glowing tiles on the ground show the maximum range of the action. Performing either one costs action points, shown as eight regenerating green dots on the status window, alongside basic statistics like health, defense and attack levels. Characters level up automatically while on the battlefield, increasing their abilities and receiving more powerful attacks. Health powers are also accessed through the attack menu, recovering lost points to an ailing comrade within their range. Characters can transform to a more powerful version when they have the ability to do so, and all the eight green dots are still available. The transformed unit has more powerful attacks and a wider range of movement.

After the battle, a map screen appears where the player can save the game, and choose the next battle from one of the available paths. It is possible to revisit battlegrounds, to level up before tackling stronger enemies.

	<name>Torneko no Daibouken - Fushigi no Dungeon</name>
	<desc>Torneko (aka Taloon) from Dragon Quest IV was a merchant and treasure hunter who always dreamed of owning his own shop. Having defeating the evil along with other heroes, he returned to Endor to work peacefully. Some time has passed and after growing successful in this town, Torneko grew anxious. Hearing rumors one day about a "Mysterious Dungeon", Torneko meets with the king to ask permission to set up a new shop, closer to this Mysterious Dungeon. By exploring this cavern and returning safely with the prizes, Torneko hopes to become the most successful merchant in the world.

Torneko No Daibouken is a overhead view game similar to Hack, what might be called a "dungeon crawl". Torneko must venture into the mysterious dungeon gathering treasure. He may equip any weapons and shields he finds there, as well as gather up items such as spell scrolls, staffs and herbs with a variety of effect. A variety of enemies, familiar to the Dragon Quest series, await him. If Torneko successfully exits the dungeon, he is able to sell any of the items he has collected. This money then goes to improve the quality of his shop and living quarters. As the game progresses, Torneko is able to store special items in the vault, which he is then able to bring with him on subsequent trips to the dungeon.</desc>

	<name>Treasure Hunter G</name>
	<desc>Brothers Red and Blue G. decide to leave their idyllic village in search of their long lost father, who left the kids years ago to go treasure hunting. Unfortunately, as soon as they begin their quest, they become entangled with a mysterious girl on the run from evil monsters who holds the key to the resurrection of a great demon. Now its up to the brothers to save the world if they ever want to find their father.

Treasure Hunter G is a top-down RPG in which you control your party of four characters as they explore the fantasy/sci-fi game world in search for quests and grinding their stats while the plot advances. The game is divided in a world-map screen, a top-down "town" mode and a turn-based fight mode in which the characters are taken to generic tiled top-down arenas in which they select each character and move or attack depending on their action points.

Enemies can be seen on the map instead of jumping at you at random intervals, and you can freely decide whether to engage them or simply circle them around. The game uses a combination of hand-drawn sprites and CGI pre-rendered one (mostly for the main characters) with a distinct cute or Super Deformed design (as usual for most console RPGs).</desc>

	<name>Uch no Kishi: Tekkaman Blade</name>
	<desc>Uchu no Kishi: Tekkaman Blade's is based on the anime Tekkaman Blade, also known as Teknoman. The game's levels are a mix of scrolling shooter and fighting game. The first part of every level is a scrolling shooter where Tekkaman Blade must survive several waves of Radam before killing two stronger boss-like Radam and meeting another Tekkaman. In scrolling shooter levels Blade can either toss his spear to defeat enemies at range or quickly slash with it to destroy bullets and enemies. One enemy type will drop different colored System Box powerups: green restores health, red destroys all enemies onscreen (except bosses), and blue turns Blade invulnerable and able to destroy all enemies upon contact (including bosses).

The end of every level is a one on one fight with an enemy Tekkaman. Each Tekkaman starts with a weapon, but the weapon will be lost if they take too much damage, forcing them to use punches and kicks. This mode can also be played in 2-player mode, where each player selects their Tekkaman.</desc>

	<desc>Umihara Kawase is an unusual platformer featuring a girl that is captured in a bizarre dream world full of walking fish. Equipped with a fishing line she can swing and abseil from platform to platform using it as a grappling hook. The game's specialty is the detailed physics system that allows Kawase to perform various tricks using the elastic and length variable rope to move around the levels. There are almost 50 fields (levels) but most have multiple exits that allow you to play through the game on different paths without playing every single field in order. You can also record a good game and save it to watch it again at a later time.</desc>

	<name>Wonder project J</name>
	<desc>There was once a great scientist and inventor named Gepetto, who lived on an island farm together with his creations, his robotic helper, the pixie Tinker, and his pet animals. His greatest creation was an artificial boy named Pino. No, he was not carved from wood, but looked just like a real boy - only he could turn his head 360 degrees. But Gepetto was arrested for an unknown reason. The boy Pino looks like a real boy, but he was completed just a few moments ago, and he knows absolutely nothing. All he can do is wander aimlessly, poking objects and turning his head. It is up to you, the player, to make Pino a real man!

In this simulation/role-playing game, you must use the robotic pixie Tinker to educate Pino. You can move Tinker around, examining objects and collecting them in an adventure-like fashion. Pino will automatically follow you to the direction you are facing, but will continue walking until you stop him. He will also pick objects and make his own "experiments" with them. Your goal is to train PIno in various disciplines. His stats can be raised in a RPG style: reading books increases his intelligence, throwing a ball increases his dexterity, and so on. By praising or scolding Pino you will gradually make him understand what should be done and what not.

To play, you move the randomly placed cookies into rows and columns of cookies with similar patterns. When you successfully assemble a row or column of the same cookies, the line will disappear, and you can begin on a new row or column. The "Yoshi" cookie is very special in both the 1-player and the 2-player game. Since the Yoshi Cookie is the key to both games, you must use it wisely.</desc>

	<desc>After having defeated the ultimate evil in his previous adventure, the great hero Adol stands on a sea shore, thinking about the fate of the once peaceful Utopian land of Ys, while the wind is blowing through his red hair. Suddenly, Adol notices a bottle, thrown onto the shore. It contains a letter, written in a foreign language, in which an unknown person asks Adol to come to his land and save it from a mysterious evil. Adol decides to accept the offer, and thus his adventure begins again...

Ys IV: Mask of the Sun is an action RPG with a combat system like the earlier Ys games. An enemy should be rammed from the sides in order to hurt him. If performed incorrectly, the player will get hurt himself. It's also possible to use magic and position oneself strategically in battle so that the enemy won't be able to inflict any damage.

The game is a series of set-piece battles where two opponents build up gauges using the D-pad and one of the face buttons: each combination leads to a separate attack and requires a different amount of build-up. The player can go through the story mode, which recounts events from the manga, or they can play a "free" mode against opponents of their choice.</desc>

	<name>Zen Nippon Pro Wrestling Dash:  Sekai Saikyou Tag</name>
	<desc>An updated version of Zen Nippon Pro Wrestling, Dash updates the character roster and adds minor cosmetic touches to the mix such as wrestler introductions and new character artwork. The biggest addition however is the inclusion of a 4-player royal rumble mode and the ability to perform team-up moves in the tag matches.

The game casts you as a wrestler of your choice in the official Zen Nippon Pro Wrestling league and pits you against the other featured wrestlers in grappling matches. As in the original you get to pick between several game modes including: Tournament, Championship (single or tag) Vs, Team (with the new 4-player variant) and Training.</desc>

	<desc>Zero4 Champ RR is a 1994 racing video game developed by Media Rings for the Super Famicom, about an 18-year-old race car driver who must chase his dreams of drag racing after being turned down for university (and becoming a r?nin due to his joblessness status).

Because the game takes place in the "near future" and it was released in the mid-1990s, the game itself is referring the story of the game to the first decade of the 21st century.

This game received a sequel in the form of Zero4 Champ RR-Z.</desc>

	<name>Acrobat Mission</name>
	<desc>Years ago humanity abandoned the over-polluted Earth to make a new home on Mars. Now, without warning, a mechanical moon has appeared in the skies over Mars, and is raining down destruction on the colonies. A plan is hastily put into action to destroy the moon and its armada of space-craft. Due to the impossible task of surviving a direct assault, the mission is code-named Acrobat Mission.

Your spaceship in Acrobat Mission is capable of firing a single straight ahead shot. By picking up a Wide upgrade, more shots are added that fly off at an angle, and the shot can be charged up to unleash a continuous short range cone of energy. Picking up a Hurricane upgrade will cause bullets to circle you defensively before shooting forward, and charging will store a full round of bullets up to be fired straight ahead all at once. Up to two bombs can be held at once, and if an enemy bullet hits a bomb it will detonate, saving your ship from damage. If your ship is hit, however, then you will have a few seconds to ram it into whatever shot you and take them down with you. Unlike most scrolling shooter games contact with an enemy ship will not kill you, but they can still push you into the path of bullets.

Play takes place over five levels, first of your launch on Mars, then the approach to the moon, and finally infiltrating the base to destroy its core. Each level ends with a unique boss except stage 4, which ends with 3 bosses.</desc>

	<desc>Past and future are connected in a way mortals do not understand...  A star was glowing up in the sky, and the demon god Alcahest appeared, bringing chaos and destruction to the world. A single swordsman stood in defiance. The four powers that protect the world, the Guardians, gave him their power, and with it the swordsman slew the demon and restored peace in the world. 

Thousand years have passed. And a new battle is already on the way. A cruel emperor leads his troops towards conquest. The kingdom of Panakeia is defending itself with the aid of its knights. Once again, the ominous star shines in the sky, indicating the demon's revival. With the help of Alcahest's power, the evil emperor wants to conquer the world. But the new generation also brings the new hero - the brave swordsman Alen. Aided by the Guardians, Alen must stop the Empire's evil plans and to destroy Alcahest once again.

This is an action game with RPG elements. You wander around slaying enemies in real time combat, gathering treasure on the way, and occasionally participating in boss battles. When you gather enough experience from fighting, you gain extra hit points. You can also upgrade your weapons. On the way you'll meet some characters who will join your party for short time, and you'll be able to use their special attacks and magic.</desc>

	<name>Cybernator</name>
	<desc>In a future where fossil fuels are limited, major countries and forces of the world are at war with one another over territory. Alliances are made, forming two major sides: The Axis and The Federation.  The elite units in these wars are Assault Suits, man-piloted combat mechs called Assault Suits.  Jake is one such pilot, drafted into the Pacific States' Marine Corp under the Federation. During his training, the war has grown substantially and upon being assigned to a platoon, he is immediately thrown into combat.

Cybernator is a side scrolling mech combat game and platform game. The player controls Jake as he moves his assault suit left and right on the battlefield. The assault suit can jump and use a jetpack for a short time to increase altitude. The assault suit begins with a Shot machine gun weapon that spreads out fire in front, and a Punch weapon for close melee. Additional weapons can be found during the course of the game and existing weapons improved by the gathering of "P" power-ups, left by defeated enemy. Each level contains a variety of enemies and an end boss which must be destroyed to reach the next level. Some levels take place as horizontally scrolling shooters, in which the Assault suit can move up, down, left and right on the screen... but is constantly advancing towards new threats.</desc>

	<name>Bahamut Lagoon</name>
	<desc>The kingdom of Kahna is in great danger. The evil Emperor Sauzer, obsessed by his world domination ideas, is preparing to invade the kingdom. The king sends his best troops of knights and wizards to face the enemy, but in vain - the kingdom is conquered by Sauzer, the king is murdered, and his lovely daughter is kidnapped. You were brave, Leader of the Dragon Squad, but now you will have to become strong. Remember the promise you gave the princess long time ago: always to be at her side. Supported by his friends and by his faithful dragons, you must now free the princess and the kingdom from the enemy's hands. If only the strongest of the dragons, Bahamut, could be awakened...

Bahamut Lagoon, created by the company which gave us the Final Fantasy games, is a mixture of turn-based strategy and RPG. Control several parties of four characters each, and command different dragons at once. The battles start on a top-down screen typical for strategy games, but often switch to a dynamic "platform" view, such as used in early console RPGs. You also can influence the game by other strategic activities, such as, for example, setting a whole forest on fire, to prevent enemies to come through it.</desc>

	<name>Bakutou Dochers</name>
	<desc>Bakutou Dodgers is a Japan-only action game for up to four players. It superficially resembles Hudson's Bomberman series, with its top-down grid stages and chaotic gameplay, but rather than leaving bombs and waiting for them to explode, the player can shoot energy at blocks and each other.

The goal is to sneak up behind the opponent and shoot them before they can reciprocate. Various power-ups may appear after destructible blocks are removed, which can give the player an edge or, in the case of the ? icon, a possible random negative effect like reversed controls. There are also wandering monsters that can cause damage to anyone they come in contact with. Every combatant has a health bar which depletes at a rate dependent on the attacks they are getting hit by.

The single-player mode involves fighting through various worlds and removing all enemy combatants from the field to progress.</desc>

	<desc>In this game, you're either in the foreground or the background, and your opponent is always on the opposite end of the screen. To fight whoever flies thar yonder in the distance, you send out projectiles, in our case fireballs. These behave differently depending on which of the four main buttons you press: if you press the A button, they fly in a curve towards the upper right part of the screen, if you push the Y button, they go left and down and so on and so forth. Sadly, they move so slowly your opponent has a good three seconds to get out of the way, and in so weird curves that aiming is impossible. Also, the screen constantly twists in all directions.</desc>

	<name>Battle Jockey</name>
	<desc>Battle Jockey is a racing game for up to four players that was developed by Nova and published by Virgin Interactive exclusively in Japan for the Super Famicom.It features horseracing, a far more popular pastime in Japan than elsewhere, and presents three separate modes: the first is the standard single-player story mode, in which the player takes a horse and jockey through training and races; the second is a battle mode which pits up to four players against each other in races that have far more power-ups and other unusual additions to the game's courses; and the third is a passive gambling mode in which the player puts money down on horses depending on their odds of winning and subsequent payouts and then watches the race play out with CPU players.The standard mode involves carefully managing the horse's stamina: being too aggressive will cause it to rear up in protest. Falling behind or running into a hedge or jump will cause the horse to lose stamina, and losing all stamina causes it to collapse briefly. The player needs to keep a steady pace, steer carefully around corners, jump at the right times and use the boost sparingly in order to win. In the battle mode stamina is less of a concern and the game more resembles RC Pro-Am: the players have to simply follow the course and avoid the dangers as they show up.</desc>

She discovers within herself the power to transform into the hero of darkness, Sailor Moon, meets other warriors who help her on her quest, and fights the evil Queen Beryl, hostile aliens, and other foes.

The events of this game take place shortly after Bishoujo Senshi Sailor Moon S, the fourth volume of the long-running series. A global peace is established in the universe, but lately suspicious things are happening. A strange meteorite is seen approaching the Earth. Street gangs and spies who work for a mysterious person called Apsu are seen in Crystal Tokyo. And the Mystic Silver Crystal, the Ginzuishou, which protects the city, is shaking! Usagi and her friends must now investigate the strange events and face the forces of Darkness once again.

The game is a console-style RPG in Final Fantasy style (battles with your party to the right and the enemies to the left), with a battle system somewhat similar to that of Chrono Trigger: you must form a party out of several available characters, make them participate in battles together, and learn powerful combo attacks.

	<name>Sailor Moon R</name>
	<desc>The game is based on the animé series Sailor Moon. The main character of the series is Tsukino Usagi, a 14-year-old schoolgirl who unexpectedly gets involved in an epic adventure. Luna, a magical talking cat, contacts her and tells her she is in fact a Sailor Moon, one of the legendary Pretty Fighters - girls who fight the forces of darkness and protect the Kingdom of Moon. 

The game is based on the events of the animé that follow the victory of Usagi and her friends over the Queen Beryl. Peace has returned to the Moon Kingdom. But suddenly, a little girl named Chibiusa arrives from the future and says the future kingdom is threatened by the forces of the evil Prince Diamond. Looks like you are the only ones who can defeat him, and save the future Sailor Moon, Chibiusa's mother.

This is a beat-'em up game. You can play as either Usagi or any of her girlfriends, including Chibiusa. You move on a platform and fight the enemies by punching, kicking, and throwing them, and by using special abilities unique to each character. You can advance only after you have cleared an area from enemies.

	<name>Sailor Moon S : Kondo wa Puzzle de Oshioki yo</name>
	<desc>Bishoujo Senshi Sailor Moon S: Kondoha Puzzle de Oshiokiyo is a falling block competitive puzzle game. Players begin by choosing from a selection of Sailor Moon licensed characters, each with a unique special attack. The player is presented with a board filled with colored blocks in three colors: red, blue and green. The goal is to remove all the blocks from play. Clicking on a block that touches several adjacent blocks of the same color will remove them all from play. As each player successfully clears blocks, they drop "black blocks" on their opponent as well as increase their power bar. Black blocks cannot be removed by normal means and disappear only when large ammounts of blocks are removed adjacent to them. As the power bar charges, players can unleash their special ability, often an attack on the other player.

This puzzle game is based on the "S" series of Sailor Moon and includes characters from there: Sailor Moon, Sailor Mars, Sailor Venus, Sailor Mercury, Sailor Jupiter, Chibiusa, Tuxedo Mask, Sailor Uranus, Sailor Neptune and Sailor Pluto.

	<desc>Bishoujo Senshi Sailor Moon S: Kurukkurin is a competitive puzzle game featuring Sailor Moon licensed characters. Upon choosing a character (each with unique "special moves"), the player competes against an opponent. Each player controls a grid of 10x6 sections (represented by hearts) initially made up of clear hearts. The player moves their cursor over the clear hearts to turn them into one of four colors: red, yellow, blue and green. Sometimes "treasures" will show up on the board. When several hearts of the same color are adjacent to one another, the player can clear them... which pushes all the hearts (and treasures) down towards the bottom. The goal is to be the player with the most treasures to end the round.

Sailor Moon characters featured are primarily from the "S" Series and includes: Sailor Moon, Sailor Mars, Sailor Mercury, Sailor Venus, Sailor Jupiter, Chibius, Tuxedo Mask, Sailor Neptune, Sailor Uranus and Sailor Pluto.

	<name>Brandish 2 : The Planet Buster</name>
	<desc>The Planet Buster continues the story that was told in the first Brandish game, and depicts the events that happened three years after the evil demonic king was defeated in his lost kingdom, sunken deep underground. You take control of a young warrior named Ares, who wields a magical weapon, a powerful sword called the Planet Buster. One day, while traveling through a desert, Ares is captured by a warlock named Karl, who is after the powers hidden within the magical sword. Suspecting Ares might have some valuable information, Karl doesn't execute him, but takes away the Planet Buster and throws Ares into his underground prison. Now your primary goal is to guide Ares out of the huge prison full of various dangers, and to get your mighty weapon back.

The game is an action RPG with a heavy emphasis on dungeon crawling. You guide Ares through rotating dungeons, fighting enemies in real-time combat, casting spells, and solving an occasional puzzle. You have the ability to jump forwards and to attack inanimate objects such as doors to cause damage and to break the object.

	<name>Captain Tsubasa J</name>
	<desc>A 1995 Japan-exclusive Captain Tsubasa video game developed and published by Bandai and was the final Captain Tsubasa game for the Super Famicom.
This game suffered lots of changes from previous games made by Tecmo, this time you will be playing in a real soccer field and in real time, which means that you need to press certain keys even without having the chance of stopping the time (like in previous games), When a certain player is confronted with a one that he considers his rival (like Misugi and Schneider or Tsubasa and *any other player*, for example) they will have a fight, which is mainly a button smashing sequence. The same goes for the sequence in which a goalkeeper tries to stop any of the special shots.
This game has almost the same story as the Captain Tsubasa J anime, except that this one will finish with a special match against an extra team. So, you'll play across various chapters, playing with Aoi Shingo in Italy or controlling the mythic Ozora Tsubasa in his match against the brazillian prodigy, Carlos Santana (nope, he isn't the singer). You'll also play with Japan national team against the same opponents as they did in the anime version..</desc>

	<desc>CB Chara Wars, sometimes written with the subtitle Ushinawareta Gag, is an RPG that features a crossover of sorts of Go Nagai's various manga franchises. These include Devilman and Mazinger Z, among others. The "CB" in the title refers to the term "chibi", which depicts characters as smaller and cuter than usual. In that sense, it is similar to the term SD (super deformation) found in several Super Famicokm Gundam game titles.CB Chara Wars began as an original video animation which first aired in 1991. A manga adaptation followed the following year, as did this game. Banpresto published the game in Japan, a company known for creating games with anime crossovers such as the Super Robot Taisen/Wars series.</desc>

	<name>Chinhai</name>
	<desc>Chinhai is a puzzle game for the Super Famicom and a variant on Mahjong Solitaire, or Shanghai. Instead of pairing and removing any two tiles that match as long as one of their sides is clear, as is the case in Shanghai, the rules of Chinhai require that the two tiles can only be removed if it's possible to draw a line between the two that doesn't make a 90 degree turn more than twice. Two tiles on opposite sides of the board, for instance, can't be paired because it would take three 90 degree turns to draw a line between them. To account for this added difficulty, the game lacks the "stacks" of tiles that frequently appear in Shanghai, instead presenting a flat board of tiles.Chinhai is named for the municipality of Chinhai in China, maintaining the theme of naming mahjong solitaire variants after territories in China. Chinhai has long since been renamed Zhenhai, which is situated in the Ningpo Prefecture and now part of a much larger city. This mahjong solitaire variant is perhaps best known as Sichuan or Shisenshou, also named for a province in China.</desc>

Instead of being another side-scrolling shooter, Bakuretsu Rantouden is actually a one-on-one 2D fighter a la Street Fighter in which the most recognizable characters from the Cho Aniki series (yes the speedo wearing bodybuilders included) fight each other for ultimate supremacy using special attacks and moves.

An interesting feature is that the game honors it's shooter roots, therefore instead of being restricted to walking backwards and forwards in the 2D plane and jumping around as in other fighting games, in this game all the characters can fly meaning the fights actually occur in mid-air allowing the players to dash all over the screen. Includes single player and 2-player vs modes.

	<name>Super B.C. Kid 2</name>
	<desc>?In this sidescrolling action-platformer, Bonk is once again trying to save his world from the evil clutches of the reptilian king, who once more is threatening the prehistoric era.  Boy, you'd think that after being defeated four times prior that he would take a hint.  This time, you also get to face his five best soldiers, who will try to stop you in your tracks.  Bonk controls rather smoothly, and he is really fun to control.  To those of you that are not familiar with the series, Bonk is a caveman who attacks his enemies with his noggin; after jumping down, from below, while swimming, and while in the air.  He can even bounce off walls with his head, skip on the water like a stone if his head is facing down, climb certain walls with his teeth, scale up waterfalls, flip in the air (so long as the attack button is repeatedly being tapped), and so forth.  As is the case with the series, you start with a regular amount of health, but if you find a translucent heart icon, you'll increase your capacity.  What's neat is how collecting the food not only scores you some points but how it also replenishes a little bit of your health, too.  This time Bonk can also run if you hold down the A button, and the X button is used if you have a special ability on you.  If you find a power-up, whether it be piece of meat, or a different icon, then you will be given a power-up ability that will be taken out the moment you're hit once (damn).  Among the power-ups are the one where the fire will be spreading if Bonk hits his head on the ground (you know, the one where he looks freaky), one where Bonk turns into a bird and gains the ability to fly, one where Bonk becomes tiny and can make platforms made out of Japanese characters, and there is one where Bonk has the ability to double-jump as a girl.  Yes, Bonk becomes a girl if he eats the pink-colored meat.  I'm dead serious.</desc>

	<name>Choujikuu Yousai Macross : Scrambled Valkyrie</name>
	<desc>The legend of the Valkyrie pilots is not yet over. Hikaru, Max, and Millia take flight to defend the earth from Zentraedi, robots, more robots, and giant space crab-bees. Now is the time to scramble Valkyrie again. 

When starting a game or continuing the player picks from either Hikaru, Max, or Millia. Each flies a custom Valkyrie with its own set weapon load-out. A Valkyrie changes its weapon and movement speed by switching between its three forms: Fighter, Gerwalk, and Battroid. Typically the Valkyrie weapon shoots straight and quickly, the Gerwalk weapon shoots around or through obstacles, and the Battroid weapon does higher damage in exchange for reduced firing rate. Each weapon can be upgraded up to twice by picking up power up items dropped by special enemy ships, but one level of power up will be lost any time the Valkyrie is shot. If a Valkyrie's entire life bar is depleted then the full stage must be repeated, provided the player still has enough continues.

In a nod to Galaga the player is able to capture some enemy craft to increase their firepower. If the player does not shoot any weapons for a few seconds a field of electricity will cover the Valkyrie. Touching some enemy ships will then cause their targeting to be shorted out and make them friendly to the player, following along and shooting or ramming onscreen enemies.

	<name>Chou Mahou Tairiku Wozz </name>
	<desc>The magic world of Wozz, populated by magicians, alchemists, and other kinds of people - including simple town and village inhabitants - was a seemingly peaceful place, until one day, a poisonous rain started turning its inhabitants into monsters. The chief wizard realizes that the demon Balaam is trying to link the world of Wozz with the world of humans. Only a human hero can stop Balaam, and the wizard's teleporting magic brings... three young humans: the Japanese girl Reona Kitazato, and two boys: the American Shot Phoenix and the Chinese Chun Chingtao. Will those youngsters be able to stop Balaam?

The game is a traditional console-style RPG similar to Breath of Fire: turn-based battles are viewed from an isometric perspective. You control all three characters as a party, but in the beginning of the game you choose one of them as the main character, and therefore will see the game from his/her perspective. In case the characters split up, you'll be able to control only the one you chose.

	<desc>Cosmo Gang: The Puzzle is a puzzle game from Namco and the second game to feature their Cosmo Gang characters. The Cosmo Gang were originally attached to a group of redemption games (like pachinko or claw machines) from Namco, but would eventually star in two Arcade games: Cosmo Gang: The Video, a Galaga clone, and Cosmo Gang: The Puzzle.

This game would become the basis of Namco's more well-known puzzle game Pac-Attack, featuring Pac-Man. As with Pac-Attack, the idea is to stack up a lot of the animated face icons (members of the Cosmo Gang) in an unbroken chain and then drop a bomb (shaped like an arrow) that goes down the chain and eliminates them all at once.</desc>

The Cosmo Gang are based on a series of characters that had previously been used by Namco for a redemption game (a type of Arcade machine that dispenses award tokens for winning a rudimentary game, of which pachinko is the most popular variant) the previous year.

Galivan and company don't have time to find items or level up weapons as in Galivan's previous outing; this is a no holds barred slugfest. Three characters are playable, each with varying stats but basically the same moveset. Each character has a standard straight ahead punch or kick, a sweeping kick, an uppercut, and a ranged attack that must be charged up. At the start of the game and the end of every level the player can add stat points to their character to increase their HP, defense, jump height, and strength of normal and special attacks.

A 2 player versus mode is included as well. Both players can choose from the three main characters, and the second player can additionally choose from one of the four normal enemy types.</desc>

	<name>Crayon Shin Chan</name>
	<desc>Five-year-old Shinnosuke Nohara is the epitome of noisy children: loud and inappropriate, infuriating to his parents, and hilarious to onlookers. Shin-chan is always getting in trouble with his parents and saying bizarre or offensive things to everyone he meets. Every so often, though, he'll try to do what his mom wants him to, but more often than not, he'll misunderstand and simply confound his parents further.

Arashi o Yobu Enji ("A Kindergartner Called Tempest") is one of many games based on the manga and anime created by Yoshito Usui. In four stages, each made up of five areas, Shin-chan must explore his neighborhood looking for a specific object. He can enter houses to ask people for information, but will often end up simply insulting them. He must also avoid or knock over the other children in the neighborhood, and has various ability cards that he can use to assist him, which might give him a water pistol or refill his health. After finding what he's looking for, Shin-chan will move on to the next area.

Also included is a minigame mode with eight different minigames, such as a bubble-blowing contest, a three-legged race, and a desperate search for clothing before school. The entire game, including the minigames, is filled with dialogue containing the same humor as the source material.

The game is a standard side-scrolling 2D platformer - common with licensed games - though it is notable for letting players decide which order they want to tackle stages, not to mention the franchise's penchant for weird/gross-out humor.</desc>

	<desc>There was once a prosperous kingdom, a peaceful kingdom, ruled by a wise old king, where all peopled lived happily together, protected by the power of a magical crystal. But one day, several dark clouds appeared over the kingdom and poured down a devastating rain. And then one of the clouds turned into a demon, and, reaching its hands to the treasure room in the palace, took the crystal away. The demon lord, still in a form of a menacing dark cloud, started spawning monsters and sending them to attack the now helpless kingdom. The king called to the heavens for help. Eight magical weapons fell on the ground, and eight warriors rose to protect their country. Your task now is to cleanse the land of the monsters and to defeat the evil demon lord.

"Crystal Beans" is an action RPG based on fighting and dungeon crawling. You can play as either of the eight initial character classes: Fighter, Warrior, Bow-man, Wizard, Priest, Kage (a kind of a ninja), Monk, or Witch. In addition, there are four secret classes you discover during your journey. Each class has its own strength and weaknesses, and two unique attack types.</desc>

	<desc>Cu-On-Pa SFC is the Super Famicom version of Cu-On-Pa.Cu-On-Pa is an original puzzle game that was developed by a little-known group called Onesong Partners. This group originally released an obscure game similar to this but with a wider audience in mind, various enhancements and alternate modes for PCs called "Endorfun" in 1995 in the U.S and Europe.Japanese developers seemed to like the concept and got permission to make something like it based on the original principals of Endorfun for the obscure Satellaview (or BS-X) and then later as a standalone release for the Super Famicom, where the game was called BS Cu-On-Pa and Cu-On-Pa, respectively. It would also get released later for Playstation.Published by T&amp;E Soft for the SFC late in 1996, Cu-On-Pa was also fan-translated sometime later for the emulation community, though the game comes with a rather straightforward tutorial and the game is very easy to understand, but difficult to master. This game is difficult to describe and in a league of its own.You play as a three-dimensional cube that must destroy all the "Life Panels" on a level. To do so, you have to rotate your cube and roll over the colored squares on the transparent field. Panels come in a variety of colors and the main way to elimate them is by having the color on the top of the cube match the color of the tile beneath you.The other way is for more skilled players and comes in the form of "Lightning Panels", which are generated when you destroy panels other than Life Panels. Destroy enough of them and you'll have lots of them. Then go and destroy a life panel! What will happen is, all lightning panels will explode that match the color of the life panel you rolled over. Moreover, the explosion spreads and detonates other tiles in the vicinity, which can spread and create a chain reaction. It's up to you how you wish to rack up points, either by time, chains, or both.Ken Kojima was the music composer.</desc>

	<name>Cyber Knight</name>
	<desc>In the 24th century, mankind has gone into space. The crew of the starship Swordfish are in an engagement with space pirates when the battle takes a turn for the worse. In desperation, the crew activate their jump drive without a destination... and end up flung across the galaxy to the galactic core. The Swordfish however is badly damaged with many casualties including the captain. Only 26 of the crew survive, and of them only 6 are qualified for combat: The commander, two soldiers, a mechanic and a doctor and six giant "Module" mechanized suits available for them. These survivors locate planet Farworld, apparently colonized by humans. There they discover the colony is under attack by a relentless mechanical aliens dubbed "Berserkers". The crew of the swordfish must fight back against the Berserkers and explore the galaxy for some means to return home.

Cyber Knight is an RPG with a science-fiction theme of being lost in an alien galaxy. The game takes place in a top-down view for movement on planets and areas, a side-view for combat sequences and a first person menu system when aboard the Swordfish starship. The Swordfish can travel between stars, scanning worlds for information. If the ship is able to land on a planet, three crew members piloting three Modules (giant robots) can be selected to debark and explore the planet. Many planets will have towns or people living on them which can be talked to in order to uncover information. Different quests are assigned in order to find the items necessary to progress. There is no system of currency or buying items. Instead, many defeated Berserkers leave behind "NeoParts", which can be brought back to the Swordfish's lab. Analysis of these Neo parts unlocks enhances statistics (endurance, agility, accuracy, etc) for the Modules and new weapons for them to carry. The six modules are unique in statistics, and also the six pilots each carry different skills.

Combat takes place in turn-based combat on a 6x6 squares field. Seen from the side view, the three modules can be positioned in relation to enemies in order to attack, using a variety of melee and long-ranged weaponry. Ammunition is unlimited, but each module also carries a number of "options" that are consumable attacks. Each Module has two sets of hitpoints: one for the pilot and one for the module itself. If either one of these reaches zero, the module is destroyed. In order to heal, the party carries 10 each of repair kits and first aid kits, which must when not in combat. These kits, as well as options and defeated pilots or modules can be restored by returning to the Swordfish.</desc>

However during their time away, the Earth Federation has been taken over by the ambitious General Forrest, who seeks to wage war on the independent systems and conquer them. Recognizing the potential weapons that could be made from the Berzerker science data, Forrest impounds the Swordfish and jails it's crew.

The Swordfish crew manages to escape, thanks to a mysterious agent "CJ", and are recruited into the resistance against the Earth Federation. Given a new spaceship, the Galvodirge, they must travel the galaxy to different human civilizations and devise a plan to stop Earth's attack.

Cyber Knight II is an RPG with science-fiction themes. As in the first game, much of the game takes place in a top-down view for movement on planets and areas, a side-view for combat sequences and a first person menu system when aboard the Galvodirge starship. The Galvodirge can travel between stars, scanning worlds for information. If the ship is able to land on a planet, the crew can debark either on foot or using combat modules (mechs). Some areas are only accessible using modules and others (such as towns) do not allow the use of these war machines. Many planets will have towns or people living on them which can be talked to in order to uncover information. Different quests are assigned in order to find the items necessary to progress. There is no system of currency or buying items. Instead, many defeated enemies leave behind "NeoParts", which can be brought back to the Swordfish's lab. Analysis of these Neo parts unlocks enhances statistics (endurance, agility, accuracy, etc) for the Modules and new weapons for them to carry. 

The crew are divided into a three person "combat team" and a three person "support team". If modules are used, they can be assigned from the ship's hanger. Unlike the first game, modules only perform a combat or a support role, and each is unique in statistics and the type of weaponry it can carry. When combat occurs on the main map, the support team will often deliver the first strike by firing missiles into the enemies. When searching facilities, caves or other locations, the support team is not available. Following either case, the combat team engages the enemy in turn-based combat on a 6x6 squares field. Seen from the side view, the three modules can be positioned in relation to enemies in order to attack, using a variety of melee and long-ranged weaponry. Ammunition is unlimited, but each module also carries a number of "options" that are consumable attacks. Each Module has two sets of hitpoints: one for the pilot and one for the module itself. If either one of these reaches zero, the module is destroyed. In order to heal, the party carries 10 each of repair kits and first aid kits, which must when not in combat. These kits, as well as options and defeated pilots or modules can be restored by returning to the Galvodirge.</desc>

	<name>Cyborg 009</name>
	<desc>Nine young people were turned into cyborgs by a company trying to take over the world. They have defeated this company and are now using their super powers to protect the world.

Based on the manga/anime by the same name, Cyborg 009 is a side-scrolling platformer in which the player takes control of 8 different cyborgs, using their special abilities to complete several missions. 

Their special abilities are as follows:
002 can fly and hover in the air; 003 can see in the dark; 004 can fire bullets from his fingers and rockets from his knees; 005 can break rocks with his fists; 006 can blow fire that also melts rocks; 007 can take on different shapes including those of enemies; 008 can swim underwater for extended periods of time; 009 can move at very high speeds. (001 is a baby and can't be taken on missions). Using these special abilities consumes SP that slowly regenerate. 

In addition to their special abilities, the cyborgs also have four attributes that govern their attack and defensive powers, their amount of SP and SP regeneration speed. 

Before every mission, one cyborg is assigned leader and two more can be selected by the player. Only one cyborg can be controlled at a time, but it is possible to switch between cyborgs at any time. All cyborgs share the same HP and SP-bar. Throughout the levels, experience points can be collected and used to increase a cyborg's attributes after a completed mission.</desc>

	<name>Dark Half</name>
	<desc>Through the Light came the Darkness, and through the Darkness came the Light. They were inseparable in the beginning, and gave birth to each other. Rukyu appeared before all the other creatures, the great demon of darkness, later to be known as the Satan. The divine hero-god Roda went up to his dark realm to defeat him, but was struck down, and presumed dead. But the hero couldn't die so easily: he swore to defeat Rukyu once and for all. Meanwhile, Rukyu doesn't just stay in his realm, waiting for Roda: he goes out to the world as a death-bringing sorcerer, and he is out for Roda...

The game is quite different from most other RPGs, because it lets you play as both the "good" hero and the villain. The game is divided into chapters, and each chapter is played by either Roda or Rukyu. You switch the two heroes chapter-after-chapter, and lead them to their ultimate battle from two opposite sides. The entire game, including the battles, is viewed from an isometric perspective. The battles are random and turn-based, and the battle field is divided into squares you can position and move your characters on. Both Roda and Rukyu can have party members join them, and both attack mostly with magic. Rukyu uses a special energy called "Soul Power", while Roda cast one-time spells from scrolls he receives after battles.</desc>

	<name>Dark Law: The Meaning of Death</name>
	<desc>Three-hundred years ago, there were two kingdoms on the earth -Reyfore, ruled by the benevolent and mighty king Reynard, and Amugnon, ruled by king Daruk. The two kingdoms could have lived in peace, but pride took over king Daruk, he didn't respect the Goddess any more, and as a result his mind became obsessed by the idea of destruction. Daruk attacked Reyfore, and for decades war was embracing the two kingdoms, setting the Earth in flames. After a prolonged battle, king Reynard defeated king Daruk, and a reign of prosperity began once again.

But can evil be truly defeated? The hero of the game, a young adventurer, falls down from a cliff while taking a stroll near the ancient Sophia Temple. He is saved by an old man who lives with his daughter Refia in a small country house. But one day, a demonic-looking knight appears, accompanied by monsters, kills the old man, and kidnaps Refia. The old man recognized the knight - it was king Daruk! Now the hero must bring Refia back and defeat Daruk once and for all.

The game has a less linear structure than a standard console-style RPG: together with the main story there are many missions, or "scenarios", which are not obligatory to complete, but which occupy a large portion of the game. In the beginning of the game you create a party of four characters, the hero and his three companions. The battles are pre-determined and take place on the same screen as the gameworld itself. Your party and the enemies can move freely around the screen and attack with melee and ranged weapons, and their actions depend on the amount of action points they have. Navigation in town is menu-based.</desc>

	<desc>Dear Boys is a 1994 Super Famicom basketball game based on the manga of the same name. The game features both a story mode, which follows the plot of the manga, and an exhibition mode that allows the player to go straight into a match.

The game features a "dramatic" perspective that is also slightly turn-based, similar to the Captain Tsubasa games. A window demonstrates what is happening - a ball is passed, a shot is thrown, the tip-off - in dramatic comic book style that is reminiscent of the manga. While a player's athlete has the ball, the player can pull up a menu that allows them to choose to pass, shoot or look at the present characters stats - each character has their own strengths and weaknesses that the player should keep in mind.</desc>

	<desc>Dharma Doujou was originally released in the arcades by Metro3D in 1994 (picture on the left). While the original version provides the same gameplay as the Super Famicom version tested here, the game does have some noticeable differences. First of all, it has more enemies and features colorful backgrounds borrowed from traditional Japanese themes and myths (well, in the Korean version of the game, Metro3D apparently threw in a couple of bikini girls for good measure). Additionally, the arcade game only contains a story mode and there is no progress map or alternate game modes like in the Super Famicom port. But, most importantly, the gameplay is slightly different - the player has to move the character around the screen in order to hit a block with the mallet. The Super Famicon version, on the contrary, automatically aligns the player with the furthest most block, and this apparently minor difference makes the gameplay of the home conversion more fast-paced and enjoyable than the original.</desc>

In this game, Nobita, a bespectacled friend of Doraemon's, suddenly meets a little fairy. Long ago, humans and fairies lived together in peace, but since the humans started developing their technology, the fairies have no place any more. Nobita and Doraemon travel to the dream world to find out how can they help.

The game is divided into adventure and platform action modes. In adventure mode, you navigate Doraemon from a top-down view, talking to people and entering houses. When you have gathered enough information, a place on the map will be highlighted. If Doraemon (or other characters, later in the game) enters this place, a platform action section begins. In platform mode, Doraemon must overcome the obstacles and defeat enemies by jumping on them or by throwing magic dusk at them, in order to retrieve important items.

Platform levels include plenty of obstacles (pits, spikes, self-destructing platforms etc.), as well as various enemies who try to stop the heroes. You can choose one of the six available characters to play through the platform level. They all can jump and defeat enemies either by jumping on their heads or by using long-ranged weapons.

	<desc>A young boy named Milon sets off to save Alis, his fairy friend, after she was captured by the evil sorcerer Amon. He later learns that the only way to defeat Amon is by collecting five legendary instruments which Amon has stolen.  The sorcerer placed a curse on these instruments so that their true powers cannot be used and then left them in the hands of his minions.  The only way to lift the curse is by collecting five stars.

Armed with only his bubble shooter, Milon must retrieve the legendary instruments, lift their curses and use their powers to defeat Amon and rescue Alis.

Traveling through many different worlds starting with the forest, Milon will be confronted by many enemies. Milon can either shoot bubbles to trap and send his enemies away, or he can jump and flatten his enemies temporarily turning them into a platform for him to walk across. 

Milon has three different "outfits": red, blue, and green. With the green outfit, Milon can withstand three hits. Each time he gets hit, he will be downgraded a color - green to blue, blue to red. If he gets hit with the red outfit, he will die and have to start the level over.

By collecting 100 music notes, Milon will get an extra life. There are also other useful items to get like bubble gum that will save Milon once if he were to fall, a special bubble shooter that let's him shoot multiple bubbles at once and a star that makes Milon temporarily invincible so that he can defeat enemies simply by running at them.</desc>

	<name>Dossun ! Ganseki Battle</name>
	<desc>A falling block puzzle game  in a pseudo-medieval fantasy setting that pits two characters against each other in an abstract form of combat that is quite similar to games like Columns. Combining at least three matching symbols in a vertical, horizontal or diagonal line does not only clear them off the screen, but also deals damage to an opponent. This means that players do not only have to keep their game area clear, but also pay attention to their characters health bar. Once a block touches the top of the screen or the health bar is diminished the game ends.

There are four different icons that have different effects when combined:
Books, swords and rocks deal damage to an opponent by attacking with fireballs, dragons or swords.
Bottles heal a certain amount of health.
Purple blocks have no effect, but clog up the screen nonetheless.

Chain reactions result in particularly powerful attacks or place one or more grey blocks inside the opponents area. They can be destroyed just like ordinary blocks, but they always stay in the same spot and do not fall down.

More complex chain reactions give access to special attacks, up to three of which can be held and activated with the shoulder buttons. Special attacks have different effects that include clearing all purple blocks, using all potions and clearing the bottom three lines.

	<desc>Another sports title in the Nekketsu High game series, this time featuring the Nekketsu guys go at each other's throat while playing baseball.

The game features a single play, Vs and Tournament/story mode. The gameplay itself is similar to other baseball games in the sense that it subdivides the different stages of baseball (batting, pitching, running bases, etc.) in different "mini games" with their own camera angles and interfaces.

As expected of a Nekketsu game you can play it rough by sneaking punches and kicks to "bend" the rules a bit, you can also use the "ki" or willpower of your players to trigger special moves and strategic management is limited to specifying different base strategies and behaviors for each player.</desc>

	<name>Dragon Ball Z Super Gokuden : Kakusei Hen</name>
	<desc>This is a direct sequel to the  first "interactive fighter" for SNES, based on the popular manga/animé series Dragon Ball. The game picks up the story where it ended in the previous game, and continues through Piccolo, Saiyajin, and Freezer sagas of the manga. After the battle with the Demon King (Daimaou) Piccolo, the twenty-third World Martial Arts Tournament is about to begin. But to the amazement of the hero Son Goku and his friends, their archrival Piccolo appears during the tournament, so that it quickly turns into a genuine battle.

You control Son Goku and his son Son Gohan, switching between them as the game progresses. The game is basically an interactive comic book in which you can influence the story by choosing to press a button when the game prompts you to make a choice. You'll also participate in battles. The battle system is similar to rock-paper-scissors game, where one kind of move always beats or always loses to another. You can dash into your enemies, attack physically, and perform special moves, pressing the buttons in real time (although the battles are divided into turns).

	<name>Dragon Ball Z : Legend of the Super Saiyan</name>
	<desc>Cho Saiya Densetsu is based on the popular manga/animé series Dragon Ball. It follows the events described in the beginning of Dragon Ball Z, the second story block, which tells about the connection of the hero Son Goku with a powerful alien race, and new mighty foes from far away planets. The game starts just where the tale of Dragon Ball begins. Son Goku goes to meet his friends, but is stopped by a mysterious stranger named Raditz who tells Son Goku they are relatives. Raditz demands from him to destroy humanity, and as Son Goku refuses, takes his son Son Gohan hostage. To rescue his son, Son Goku joins forces with his arch-rival, the Demon King Piccolo, who obviously has his own plans concerning Raditz. And thus begins the story during which Son Goku will learn of his true origin...

The game is a RPG similar to the card-based Dragon Ball Z RPGs for NES. During battles, you choose cards from your card inventory, which determine the nature and the strength of your characters' attacks. You can also train your characters in training houses and upgrade their special Ki power. Unlike early DBZ RPGs, you can move around freely in Cho Saiya Densetsu, and your movements are not determined by cards. You can also fly around the world and use your special Dragon Radar to discover location of magical Dragon Balls.

	<name>Dragon Quest I.II</name>
	<desc>This is a remake of two classic NES RPGs - an exclusively Japanese release of the two first Dragon Quest titles on one cartridge.

In Dragon Quest (known as Dragon Warrior in the US), you play as the descendant of the legendary warrior Erdrick, and your goal is to recover the magical Ball of Light from Erdrick's and the humanity's arch-enemy, the Dragon Lord. In Dragon Quest II, you assume the role of the descendant of the hero of the first game, and must join forces with two other characters in order to defeat a demon lord who destroyed a nearby city and killed its inhabitants. 

Both RPGs feature random battles and turn-based combat viewed from first-person perspective. In Dragon Quest you fight alone, while in the sequel two other characters can join your party, and you also fight against multiple enemies at once.

The remake includes updated graphics (although they still retain the original NES look), sound of SNES quality, and some changes in the gameplay and in the game world. Certain locations are larger, some menu commands (such as "Stairs") are omitted, and there is a larger variety of items.

	<name>Dragon Quest III</name>
	<desc>Dragon Warrior III is the concluding game of the first Dragon Quest/Dragon Warrior trilogy, and its story takes us back to the time period of the legendary Erdrick (also known as Loto), the ancestor of the first game's hero. You are the son of a powerful warrior Ortega, skillful in physical combat and spellcasting. Your father went out to fight the evil Baramos, who is responsible for the appearance of monsters in your region, and never returned. You are sent by the king on a quest to continue your father's brave deeds and to defeat Baramos.

Dragon Warrior III is a top-down role-playing game where you travel around the overworld, caves, castles, cities and other locations while battling random encounters, buying equipment, and talking to people. You and your party members receive experience when they beat up monsters and level up with enough experience, increasing their stats. The game features a day/night cycle - as you travel, day slowly changes to night and vice versa; shops are typically closed at night. 

You begin with control of just the main character but can quickly recruit three more members to your party. During the game you can choose to drop your current characters and recruit others at any time. The recruitable characters are divided into six classes: soldier, fighter, merchant, goof-off, pilgrim and wizard.

The game has a unique job system, giving you the ability to switch your hired characters' classes after they have achieved at least level 20 in their base class. Characters can switch to the other beginning classes, as well as the sage class, which is not available at the beginning. When a character switches classes, they lose all earned experience points, and half of their stats, but retain all of the abilities of the previous class. In this way, you can create powerful combination characters that are able to cast spells and fight effectively.

	<desc>You are the son of the brave warrior, Lord Papas. It appears that your mother died just after giving birth to you, and your father took you on a long journey when you were a little baby, and all you know is that he was searching for something. Now you are six years old, and Lord Papas brings you to your home village. After some time, you learn that His Highness Prince Henry was kidnapped by bandits. Your father attempts to rescue him, and during this action you discover that perhaps your mother is still alive... The game follows the story of Papas' son, and this story is stretched over years, as the hero grows and becomes a man of courage and virtue. During the game, the hero will discover the truth about his mother, and will have to make some crucial decisions, such as which girl to marry (the decisions affect the course of the game and its ending).

"Dragon Quest V" is a party RPG with turn-based combat, and battles viewed from 1st person perspective, just like all its predecessors. Your party roams about the world, fighting random enemies, performing quests, and defeating bosses. The novelty is in the game's unusual story, which spans almost a lifetime of the hero. 

"Dragon Quest V" was not available outside of Japan until 2009, when the DS version was released in the United States.

"Dragon Quest VI" is the last SNES game of the Dragon Quest series (called "Dragon Warrior" in US). It is a party RPG with turn-based combat and battles viewed from 1st person perspective. Not much has changed since the NES days of Dragon Quest - gameplay style, setting, and even menu layout seem almost identical to those of the early classics. Like its immediate predecessor Dragon Quest V, this game was never released outside Japan.

There, he was found by people of Kardosa Empire, who soon understood they have in their hands a human who possesses the secret of a superior ancient technology, that was unknown to the primitive civilization of the present...

You play the role of Aleth, the son of the High Priest in the small kingdom of Garade, whom leads a peaceful life with his friend Lagnus, Prince of Garade. One day Aleth accidentally gains possession of a precious artifact which is sought after by the Kardosa Empire. Aleth and Lagnus get involve in a conflict which will soon lead them to great discoveries of the secrets of the ancient civilization, of the great destruction that occurred thousand years ago, and of their own true identities...

The game is a console-style RPG: your party meets randomly encountered enemies and bosses, and fights them in turn-based combat viewed from isometric perspective. You upgrade armor by buying it, and also can buy weapons, but weapons can also be upgraded for money to different levels, to create powerful attacks called "techs".</desc>

In Edo no Kiba you are always moving forward, either running or walking (or, in some levels, flying), although you can still move around the screen as in most belt-scrolling games. Your avatar attacks by slashing to the right with his energy sword, and he can also hold his sword defensively to deflect some bullets. By then holding forward and releasing attack he can throw the sword like a boomerang. He can also jump. A bomb follows the avatar around on any on-foot level that can be used to destroy all enemies onscreen at any time, and it will be replaced whenever a life is lost. Environments range from city streets to sewers and a flying battleship. Each level ends with a boss fight against an enemy that can withstand many attacks.</desc>

	<desc>In "Emerald Dragon", you play as Atrushan, a blue dragon who lives in the Dragon World. One day, he and his friends discover a ship wreck near a mountain. After examining the wreck, the dragons find a human child - a little girl. The wise White Dragon, the leader of the dragons, tells them that her name is Tamryn and that she will play an important role in their lives. The girl doesn't remember anything, and grows up together with the dragons. But when she turns fifteen, she decides to go back to her homeland - the Human World. Soon after Tamryn has left, Atrushan realizes he can't bear the separation, and asks the White Dragon to allow him to go and find Tamryn in the Human World. But a mysterious evil curse has been placed on the dragons - they can't appear among the humans in their true form. Atrushan agrees to become a human and goes to the Human World - to find Tamryn, and also a way to remove the curse...

The game features traditional Japanese-style RPG gameplay - Atrushan and his party travel over world map, visiting towns and descending into dungeons. The battle system is somewhat unusual - you can control only Atrushan, while other party members are controlled by the AI. You have a special bar for your actions in battle: once it is depleted, you can't perform any action and must wait for your next turn. You can move freely over the battle field, position yourself strategically near or far away from the enemy, attack from different sides, and assign general strategies to your non-controllable party members.</desc>

	<name>Famicom Tantei Club Part II - Ushiro ni Tatsu Shou</name>
	<desc>An autumn night "3 years ago" a 15-year-old boy (the protagonist of the game) are on the run from two police officers. A man, respected by the police, decides to care of the situation by himself. The man takes the boy to a coffeehouse; the boy ran away from his orphanage to find his parents' whereabouts. The man, a private detective named Shunsuke Utsugi, convinces him to become his assistant.

The objective is to solve two cases; the murder of a schoolgirl investigating her school's ghost story, and an older murder nearing legal expiration. Like the previous game in the series, the game progresses as the player chooses from a set of commands displayed on a menu. These commands are used to interact with other characters and the game's environment, examine clues, or review facts. The results of choosing each command are displayed in the text.</desc>

	<name>FEDA: The Emblem of Justice</name>
	<desc>In a fantasy world, a soldier from the imperial forces deserts after witnessing the massacre of innocent villagers by his unit. He is sent to jail to be executed, but manages to escape with the help of two former unit colleagues. The group flees through the country-side, while being pursued by imperial soldiers. On their way, they join forces with other rebels to fight against the enemy, while uncovering hidden secrets and evil plots by the Empire.

FEDA: Emblem of Justice is a strategy RPG similar to Shining Force and other titles with preset characters and linear gameplay. The player commands a party of varying size and characters with diverse skills.

In the main battle sections, the player and the CPU-controlled enemy take turns moving the troops and giving orders. A menu at the bottom of the screen shows all the possible actions, where soldiers can defend, move, attack, or use an inventory item on each turn. The range of their movements and weapons vary according to their nature. A crossbow character can shoot from the back, while most sword and knife users have to be adjacent to their targets. Magic offensive powers have different ranges as well, reaching enemies that are far away from the attacking character. Health points can be recovered by eating rations or by magic, where a healer can restore points to several characters at once.

Each party member has separate health and magic points, as well as other statistics like defense and attack power. They receive experience points after slaying an enemy or casting a spell, and extra points at the end of the battle. Their skills increase after surpassing 100 points.

The map screen shows the party and groups of enemies traveling through the landscape in turns. The menu has options for moving the group or camping. In the encampment, one of the characters around the fire pit saves the game, while another inside the tent provides system options to change the interface color, adjust sound volume and rename the party members.

In some locations like temples, villages and towns, the party has to explore the place and talk to the citizens to move on to the next section. In later battles, the player has to make a moral choice about attacking mutated humans. At the end of each battle, the party is assigned a dark or light emblem, and certain party members choose to leave or stay in the group based on its alignment.</desc>

	<name>Final Fantasy II</name>
	<desc>This is the fourth entry in the  Final Fantasy series. It was known as Final Fantasy II internationally, because the  second and third games were never released outside of Japan.

The military country of Baron is one of the strongest in the land, with a proud army and a majestic air force known as the Red Wings. But, while their armies are kind and loyal, the recent actions of the King are anything but. The young Captain of the Red Wings, Cecil, is ordered to steal a crystal from a village of innocent magicians, and when he questions the actions of his King, Cecil is immediately thrown out of the country and sent off to kill strange monsters. Little does he realize the price the King's actions will pay, and what the true secret of the crystals, and their powers, truly is...

This is the first Final Fantasy game that introduced the famous ATB (active-time battle) system: during the battles, you have a time indicator for each party member that tells you when this character is able to act. If it takes you too long to select a command for this character, the enemy will act without waiting for your turn. The game abandons the job system that was implemented in the first and the third game in favor of pre-set character classes (paladin, white mage, ninja, etc.) assigned to each party member.

The PlayStation version adds a new rendered intro and ending.</desc>

	<name>Final Fantasy V</name>
	<desc>The Elemental Crystals...the life source of the planet. With them, gentle winds blow, the seas are active, fire burns bright, and the earth is full of life. All seems well in the world, until the wind suddenly stops, the sea begin to grow stagnant, the heat of fire becomes scarce, and the earth begins to wither. King Tycoon, sensing a premonition of evil, hurries off to check on the Wind Crystal, only to witness it destroy itself.

Meanwhile, a young traveler named Butz is camping in a field when a giant meteor strikes the planet. When he heads out to examine the meteor, he is shocked to find a young girl named Lenna, who is the princess of Tycoon, and a old man named Galuf, who is on a critical mission. Later, joined by Faris, a pirate captain, the foursome must travel the land in search of the destructor of the Crystals, and save the planet at any cost!

Final Fantasy V featured many new gameplay options and tactics, including an improved Job/Ability system (like in Final Fantasy Tactics), the return of the ATB (Active Time Battle) turn system, and all of the classic FF gameplay you've come to know and love!

Final Fantasy V was released as a stand-alone game in Japan, and again in Final Fantasy Collection. Its U.S. debut was as part of Final Fantasy Anthology. It was also later ported to the Gameboy Advance, adding 4 new Jobs, a new 30-floor dungeon, a bestiary, a music player, the ability to quick save anywhere, a few extra pieces of equipment, and a newly update translation.</desc>

	<name>Final Fantasy III</name>
	<desc>This is the sixth entry in the  Final Fantasy series. It was called Final Fantasy III because three of the five previous installments of the series were never released outside of Japan.

1,000 years ago, the War of the Magi occurred. People remember it as one of the most horrible tragedies in history. Since the War of the Magi, magic has been all but forgotten, technology began to grow, and people returned to seemingly normal lives. The only true worry people had was the Empire, whose leaders were looking to revive the great force once known as "magic".

But then...something happened that would change the course of history forever...

The Empire had heard word of the remains of a mystical being, known as an "Esper", being found in the mining town of Narshe. Quickly, three soldiers were dispatched to find this Esper and bring it to the Emperor. One of the soldiers, a young girl, triggers a power in the Esper that will begin one of the most dangerous series of events ever. And the only ones who can help her are a rag-tag band of rebels and heroes, whose very hearts and souls are the only ones that can save the world from the mad plans of the Empire.

The game maintains the ATB (active time battle) system of the two previous Final Fantasy games, spicing classic turn-based combat engine with a real-time element. The customization system combines character-specific classes with free-flowing character development. By finding various Espers and equipping them on characters, you can improve their parameters in different ways and choose the magic spells you want to learn for each character.</desc>

Book 1 of the game is essentially a remake of the first NES game. Book 2 continues the story with the same characters.

This game expands the series, however it drops explorable towns and the navigation through a world map which was introduced in Fire Emblem: Gaiden. New features include the ability to dismount the horse and pegasus mounted units, to allow the riders to fight indoors if needed.

At its most simple the story is of Prince Leaf of Lenster's struggle to free his native land from two forces, the Grandbell Empire and the Loptus religion.

Features introduced into this part of the series include fog of war and night maps with limited vision, this requires characters to use torches and wands to light their way. Also the capture command which allowed enemies to be subdued and their weapons taken.

	<name>From TV animation - Slam Dunk SD Heat Up!!</name>
	<desc>Among the most famous Japanese comics of the 90s are definitely Slam Dunk. The manga tells of the running track that will make the young hoodlum Hanamichi Sakuragi who joined the basketball club in Shohoku high school just because initially interested in the sister of the captain Akagi but later this sport will conquer him so much that he becomes a real basketman.

The game is essentially an arcade sports title basketball basically. The main screen there will be little choice given the presence of only three modes: Story mode and classic friendly tournament. In the first we follow the events of the television series whose plot differs slightly from the original one: using Shohoku then we will qualify for the national championship. The second and third but I think there is a need for further explanation.

Executable field operations would also be different, you can also feint shots and blow up their opponents markers. Then successfully accumulating a sequence of 'affirmative action' row (steps succeeded, baskets made or avoided), will fill a horizontal bar at the top of the screen and, as he did a little 'in the playroom with the SNK Street Hoop, pressing simultaneously the three keys will not dorsal (except B), you can make a super nice shooting with supplemental animations depending on the player used.

	<path>./Front Mission (Japan) [T-En by FH v1.0b].mgd</path>
	<name>Front Mission</name>
	<desc>In the future, many military forces are dependent on huge mech robots, called Wanzers (Walking Panzers) for combat. At Huffman Island, located in the the pacific ocean, wanzers are deployed by both the USN (United States of the New Continent) and the OCU (Oceana Community Union), who dispute ownership over the island.  One night, the OCU forces stage a covert recon mission on a facility located in Larcus, a USN-held territory and weapons facility. Lead by a soldier named Roid, this mission was entirely unofficial and violated the peace treaty. During the mission, USN forces lead by Commander Driscoll appeared and ambushed the OCU soldiers. During the combat, Roid's fiance, Karen is killed and the USN facility is blown up; placing the blame on the OCU. This became known as the &amp;quot;Larcus Incident&amp;quot; and the OCU denied all knowledge of it's soldiers actions. Ultimately it would be a leading cause to the second Huffman War. 

One year later, the war is underway and Huffman island is under provisional control of the OCU, but with a weakened military unable to defend against USN attacks. The soldiers involved involved in the Larcus Incident have all been discharged and disgraced. Roid spends his time fighting as a gladiator in the Wanzer fighting arena before being approached by a mysterious man. Colonel Olson has found out about Roid's history and wants him to command a mercenary unit he is assembling on behalf of the OCU, dubbed &amp;quot;Carrion Crow&amp;quot;. Convincing Roid that Driscoll is still out there on the island, Roid agrees.

Front Mission is a turn-based strategy RPG played from an isometric perspective. Players progress in the story through large strategic battles involving multiple units and cutscenes between them. At certain places, usually towns, the player can visit multiple locations including bars and shops, and talk to people. Shops are also found to purchase new weaponry, parts and make repairs. In combat, each Wanzer robot is a seperate unit and, has a large variety of weapons and attack styles depending on what's equipped. Units get experience for defeating enemies and also for using various techniques. The more an attack is used, the more powerful it becomes.</desc>

	<name>Front Mission - Gun Hazard</name>
	<desc>The year is 2064, when the great solar power satellite, ATLAS is overshadowed by the invention of fusion power. The government alliance that had supported the building of ATLAS now find themselves facing economic crisis as the balance of power shifts. In this world of conflict and change, the Walking Panzer, or Wanzer, (a form of mecha) becomes the standard armored unit for wars and petty battles across the globe. For the small nation of Bergen, a coup d'etat is underway, staged by Colonel Ark. Seeking to establish complete control over the government and the NORAD units stationed there, Ark's first step involves the capture of President Orwen. Tipped off to the rebellion, Orwen seeks to flee from Bergen, looking for safe passage out of the seaport of Port Ertothal. A young Wanzer pilot, Albert Grabner, is assigned escort duty to the president by loyal elements of the army stationed there...

Gun Hazard is a side-scrolling version of the Front Mission series. Gameplay is more than a little similar to Cybernator or Metal Warriors. The player moves between different stages on an area map. Once inside a level, the player controls Albert and his wanzer as it moves left, right across the screen. The wanzer is able to jump, and attack with a primary and a special weapon. At any time during a level, Albert can eject from his heavily armed wanzer to explore. Although vulnerable when outside, Albert is able to reach areas the wanzer cannot, in addition to being a smaller target and being able to jetpack indefinitely.

Additionally, Albert can recruit other characters through the normal course of the story, some of whom can be designated to support roles. These support characters when set can provide a variety of different cover fire abilities for Albert during his missions. They too gain experience and levels. Different weapons and armor can be found or bought. Essential components include the Booster ability which allows the wanzer to hover and increase it's jumps, as well as the Dash ability which allows quick left-right movement by the wanzer. Money and experience are earned through the completion of level objectives as well as the kill count of enemy wanzers.</desc>

	<name>Fushigi no Dungeon 2 - Fuurai no Shiren</name>
	<desc>The legend of the Golden Condor... from village to village and  from town to town, everybody speak of it - somewhere, beyond forests and mountains, there lies an idyllic Golden Land, the land of eternal happiness. Many adventurers have tried to find their way to the mysterious land of the Golden Condor, but how many of them have survived the impassable mountain paths, the dark forests and caves, and the vicious monsters? You are the wanderer Shiren, and the goal of your life is to find the Golden Land. Together with your best buddy Koppa, a talking weasel, you decide to venture deep into the dungeons that lead to the land, and to try your luck there.

Furai no Shiren (The Wanderer Shiren) is a roguelike, hack-and-slash game with randomly generated dungeon areas, items, and monsters. Despite being named Fushigi no Dungeon 2 it has no relation to the storyline or characters of the first game in the series, it does however share the same style of gameplay. The movement is turn-based. You visit towns and villages where you can buy and sell supplies. The dungeons are full of various traps and monsters, and sometimes non-playable characters you can talk to, some of which can join you on your quest.

	<name>Galaxy Wars</name>
	<desc>Home version of the 1979 arcade game of the same name. The aim is to launch missiles from the bottom of the screen at enemy spacecraft located at the top. To get there, the missile must pass through a asteroid belt flying across the screen and avoid the shots being fired down from the spacecraft. It is the players job to control the missile. Once launched it can be moved left and right and can be sped up by using the boost to speed it's way out of trouble. Points scored depend on the location of the hit on the enemy spacecraft. The speed at which enemy spacecraft move increases as the number of them decreases. Once all spacecraft have been destroyed, another wave starts, the speed decreases again and the process repeats. A life is lost when a missile is hit by a shot or collides with an asteroid.

Three game modes are available, B&amp;W and Color recreate the graphics and behaviour of the original arcade game in black &amp; white and color respectively whilst Neo mode updates the game with improved graphics and slightly different behaviour. There's also a turn-based two player mode. Other options include changing the number of lives available at the start of a game and the number of points needed for an extra ship.</desc>

	<desc>As you may have guessed from the number 2 in the title, this is the second SNES game in the popular blend of the adventure and jump and run genres which is the Goemon series. Again, you (and your partner, in 2 player mode) control Goemon, his friend Ebisu-Maru and, new to the bunch, robot Sasuke, through loads of action stages and villages. Another new feature comes with 3D boss fights, featuring the giant mech type robot called "Goemon Impact".

	<name>Ganbare Goemon 3</name>
	<desc>Third title in the Ganbare Goemon series of platform/adventure games which cast you as the heroic Goemon as he attempts to save feudal Japan from all sorts of wacky evildoers. This time around, a time-travelling machine threatens all of Japan and thus Goemon and co. must jump into the future to stop the machine.

The game alternates between a top-down world map view in which your characters explore the gameworld and side-scrolling stages in which the main action lies. As in most games of the series there are also loads of mini-games and unique gameplay sequences such as maneuvering Goemon's giant mecha.

The game continues the tradition of bizarre humor unique to the series, you can play as either Goemon or any of his 3 companions, Ebisumaru, Sasuke or Yae with each sporting unique weapons and abilities and also with their own dialogue options and cutscenes, which feature sitcom-like pre-recorded laughs for added wackiness.

	<desc>Fourth title in the Ganbare Goemon series of platform/adventure games which cast you as the heroic Goemon and his gang of wacky adventurers as he fights evil all over Japan. This sequel however, takes the action to outer space as the gang attempts to rescue Goemon Impact (Goemon's giant mecha) from a strange planet.

The game is based around a stage-select hub from which you select which character you want to play as and then attempt to clear the game's many side scrolling stages in standard action platformer fashion, navigating the obstacles and defeating all enemies you run into with your weapons. Since each one of Goemon's allies got stranded on a different planet, you must take control of each one of them in order to clear the stages and recover the special ability unique to each character that must be later put to use to release Goemon Impact. As in other games of the series there are also loads of mini-games and unique gameplay sequences triggered in boss fights, bonus stages and special situations. These involve shooter sequences, racing &amp; sport games and other assorted diversions.</desc>

In Ganbare Daiku no Gensan, you must go through five stages (with two areas each), destroying workers that get in your way using your mallet. You can use it to perform two special attacks. One that sends fireballs going in all directions, and a more powerful one that sends shockwaves, destroying everything on screen. At the end of each area, a boss needs to be defeated in order to proceed to the next one.</desc>

	<name>Gunple: Gunman's Proof</name>
	<desc>The year is 1880. Two meteors fell on Earth on a small island near North American Pacific Coast. In the middle of the island there is a small town governed by a sheriff. At first, the town's inhabitants didn't pay attention to the meteors. But then, strange things started happening. Monsters attacked people, and left on the victims' bodies a mysterious crest with one word: demiseed. One day you, a young boy who lives in the town, are contacted by two aliens who came in a miniature space ship. One of the aliens introduces himself as Zero, the Space Sheriff, and explains that an intergalactic criminal named Demi has escaped from justice and is hiding somewhere on the island, being the cause of all the troubles lately. Zero then possesses your body, lends you his powers, and commands you on the quest to destroy Demi and to bring peace to your island and to the alien world alike!

The game is an action/adventure with slight RPG elements (buying and upgrading weapons, etc.) set in Wild West. While featuring traditional dungeon-crawling and many enemies to dispose of in real time combat, the game doesn't equip you with standard medieval swords, but with pistols, shotgun, machine gun, and even a flamethrower. Your weapons have infinite ammo. You can duck to avoid the alien monsters' fire, and perform special attacks with various types of weapons.</desc>

Gekitotsu Dangan Jidousha Kessen: Battle Mobile plays similarly to Spyhunter in both perspective and objective, but your car in Battle Mobile isn't quite as high tech an instrument as that other game's vehicle. You can launch unlimited missiles, but they can only hit helicopters. For ground based targets you must dash into them to ram them off the road. Your car's health is constantly dwindling, even when you're not being attacked by enemies, so picking up the occasionally appearing energy refill items is essential. Shields can be picked up and stored that will make your car invulnerable to all damage for a short while.</desc>

	<name>Genocide 2</name>
	<desc>The world is still recovering from war. The mega-corporation CONEX has been spearheading the rebuilding process, but their true intentions are far from altruistic. By gobbling up their competition, and with the help of new weapons technology, CONEX is on the cusp of controlling the world. Only a hero from the last war can defy them and stop their plans of conquest.

Genocide 2 is a modified version of the PC release. The player takes control of a ten meter tall robotic ninja: the Tracer. Its only form of attack is a sword, but it can hold several extra weapons, and always has access to the Betty. The Betty can be fired in eight directions, returns to the Tracer after being fired, and can block enemy bullets. The objective of each stage is to reach the end, and some stages require you to destroy targets along the way. Any items picked up by the player, or damage done to the Tracer, carries over between stages, and each stage records your fastest time for beating them.

Aside from the visual downgrade, Genocide 2 also lost many minor enemy types and one mid-boss in the transition to the Super Famicom. The first stage was removed, and the first two levels of stage 2 were reversed. The Betty now can only be used for a limited time, and must recharge when its time has run out.</desc>

	<desc>Ghost Chaser Densei doesn't take any dramatic departures from the standard scrolling-brawler plot-line. A city twenty minutes in the future must be saved from a terrorist organization, and between salvation and you is a long, straight line full of goons who must be punched. Aside from receiving orders from your boss before each level, and the quick conversation with a boss or rare NPC, the story won't attempt to get in the way of beat-downs.

There are three playable characters in Ghost Chaser Densei: the martial artist Makai, the mace wielding cat-girl Iyo, and the autonomous robot Belva. Each has unique moves as well as the basic abilities of attacking, jumping, blocking, throwing, and using a special if attack and jump are pressed together. Unlike most brawlers these special moves deplete a recharging special bar, not your health. Makai can throw fireballs and do a flying kick in midair, Iyo can triangle jump and preform a spinning piledriver, and Belva can double jump and preform a grapple special. Characters also have a team up special if playing in two player mode. Enemies range from armored soldiers to lizard men to robots, but most break down into the same hierarchy: weaker types will rush at you while stronger types will shoot projectiles then rush at you. Each level ends with a unique boss with multiple short and long range attacks.</desc>

	<desc>Ackman is not what one would call a good person. His job is to murder and steal souls for the Demon Lord. The angel Tenshi has taken it upon himself to put an end to Ackman's nefarious ways, and sends an army of angels and hired assassins to take out Ackman for good. It's just as well, because Ackman was getting bored without anyone to kill.

Go Go Ackman is a scrolling platformer starring the titular Ackman. Ackman can punch and charge up a ranged wave of energy, and he can also jump on some enemies to stun them before running into them and turning them into a sliding projectile. Ackman can hold up to three bombs that can clear the screen of enemies, and can also hold a weapon, either a sword, boomerang, or pistol, but it will be lost if Ackman is hit. Levels are linear, but do allow some exploration to find weapons and items hidden off the beaten road.</desc>

	<desc>Yet again Tenshi is hard at work on finding a way to kill off Ackman for good. But, what's this, it seems there's been a shake up in the chain of command, and now Tenshi is wanted by the Angel Police! Will Tenshi be able to clear his good name? Who's really pulling the strings here? And, most importantly, does Ackman care about any of this at all?

The last of the Ackman games, Go Go Ackman 3 makes very few changes from Go Go Ackman 2, although Tenshi is now a playable character. Both Ackman and Tenshi can be switched between at special points in a level, but they share the same health meter and weapon. Unlike Ackman Tenshi can fly, but as he is an angel he can not collect the souls of enemies he kills. Souls have changed too, and are now used as currency in shops where Ackman can buy temporary powerups or healing. Finally Ackman has lost the ability to slide enemies along the ground, but he can now move while holding a stunned enemy.</desc>

	<path>./Gokujou Parodius (Japan).mgd</path>
	<name>Gokujou Parodius</name>
	<desc>Konami's Gradius and space-shooter parody series continues with this second installment.  Gameplay is similar to the Gradius series in that you control a ship that can move anywhere on the screen while the screen itself scrolls from left to right. Enemies appear in waves and destroying all the fighters in a single wave releases power-ups which may be used to choose your ships upgrade. The Upgrade bar too is lifted from Gradius, however each character has different names and functions for their upgrades.

In Gokujyou Parodius, you are now able to now choose from 11 different characters... many of whom appear from other Konami games. They include:

1. Vic Viper: a ship from Gradius

2. Takosuke: the "octopus" of the previous Parodius game, and also seen in at least one Goemon

3. Twinbee: making his appearance from the Twinbee side scrolling games, Twinbee is a squat round robot with a jetpack and a disproportionately big punching glove

4. Pentaro: the original "joke character", Pentaro made an appearence in a previous Gradius title as a flying penguin. However he does star in his own games as well, Konami's Penguin Adventure

5. Hikaru: Hikaru is a girl in a tight fighting "bunny suit" who is riding on top of a missile

6. Mambo: Mambo is a strange looking fish with two horns on the top of his head and on his underside

7. Michael: some kind of fat angel pig. He has wings and a golden halo over his head

8. Koitsu: A blue stick man riding on a surfboard. He's probably one of the more 'normal' characters

9. Goemon: star of the Goemon series of games. Goemon is a ninja warrior equipped with wooden pipes. He flies around in a superman pose for his appearance in Parodius

10. Dracula: star of Konami's Kid Dracula, this white haired squat character retains his vampiric abilities including that of being able to change into a bat

11. Upa: a flying baby. Upa is actually from a Konami game by the name of Bokutte Upa but is probably just more recognizable as "the flying baby" of this crazy shooter

In addition to your player-character, the levels themselves will be full of a strange mix of Konami references, bright colors and the just plain zany. it's not uncommon to have to fly your ship underneath a woman's legs for example or chased by a giant walrus or having enemies shooting cute pink hearts at you.</desc>

Each has slightly different movesets to use on downed or stunned opponents, but each posses the punch, throw, and jump usual for belt-scrolling brawlers. The characters must get past several minor enemies on each level before fighting a stronger boss at the end. Each enemy will drop a cooking ingredient when defeated, and at the end of each level two ingredients can be combined to make a meal that will restore some health based on if the chosen character likes it or not. Environments range from slums and palaces to high speed trains and space ships, but in general there is not much continuity between different areas.</desc>

	<path>./GT Racing (Japan).mgd</path>
	<name>GT Racing</name>
	<desc>GT Racing is a Super Famicom racing video game where the player gets to drive a Gran Turismo car in either championship or practice mode.  The game is based on the 1996 Super GT racing season using the horsepower standards and rules of the era.  

During championship mode, the player is asked enter a number, his or her driver's name, and the team name that he or she will use during the championship. The driver's name and team can be entered using either English or Japanese letters. When a player beats a record, he or she is asked to insert his or her number, name or initials (up to four characters and two digits for the number). Championship mode can last for multiple seasons. Playing ninety-nine seasons in a single racing career is theoretically possible due to the double-digit nature of the season information. There are eight different tracks, including the Suzuka Circuit that has been shown in video games since Pole Position II and Fuji Speedway (complete with a virtually photorealistic Mount Fuji in the background).

Versus mode is for two human players only and the record options allows the players to look at his or her previous records. In a race, there are up to fifteen opponents to race against. The player gets rewarded with an opportunity to upgrade his or her equipment after a top five finish on any race course. Bonus equipment includes a faster engine, better tires, and a special dose of nitrous oxide created specifically for Gran Turismo vehicles. All of the bonus automobile parts are automatically installed in the appropriate parts for supercharging the vehicle. Once all the special parts are earned, the automobile is considered to be fully upgraded. The ultimate goal is to win the Gran Turismo championship for his or her team in addition for him/herself.

The "free practice" is essentially a time trial mode where the player races by him/herself for up to ten laps. Acquiring damage is still possible either crashing into walls or through normal wear and tear. The fastest lap time gets captured for the record book just like in the other modes of the game. Before being able to practice freely, the player can also choose the weather condition and the setup of his vehicle</desc>

	<desc>In Violinist of Hameln you play the role of Hamel, a sort of wanderer / adventurer whose weapon is a violin. His music can cover enemies in fear, or even control their minds. Hamel and his mascot Oboe arrives at Staccato, a small town attacked by monsters, and drives them away with his power. Impressed, a cute little girl named Flute decides to go with Hamel in order to find and destroy the evil power behind the attacks.

The game is typical platform. You play as Hamel, and with your violin can shoot musical notes to beat your enemies. However, you count with Flutes aid. Flute follows you (although you can order her to stop and stay), but also can be grabbed and thrown at the enemies (yes, thrown at the enemies). Flute can also collect through all the stages some costumes that, when worn, give her special abilities, such as flying, leaping, breaking walls or even explode and kill all in screen. At the end of each stage, of course, youll find the typical boss, all named as musical instruments.

	<desc>Hat Trick Hero 2 is the follow up to Hat Trick Hero, and it is loosely based on the arcade game Hat Trick Hero '93. One or two players can play in a exhibition game (one single match) or in a world league. The game scrolls horizontally uses mode 7 graphics to give the playing field some perspective.

There are 18 countries to select from, each with different running, kicking and technical abilities. You can use 5 different formations, which are 4-4-2, 4-3-3, 3-5-2, WM and libero. You also select a team captain from 8 different characters.

You can perform a foul tackle on the opponent, but when the referee is close enough to notice it you risk getting a yellow or red card. By holding down a direction after shooting the players can shoot the ball with curve effect. During the game a power-up bar is charged which can be used for special abilities. Holding down R allows you to run faster, but this slowly drains the power-up bar. With a fully charged power-up bar you can perform an unstoppable hyper shoot by pressing a special combination, and this drains the power-up bar entirely.</desc>

Cast into the role of a young boy from a remote village, you live a peaceful life until one day the pigs in your village go crazy, and as a result you are thrown underground, only to be saved by mysterious fairies. Something goes wrong, and the world as you knew it doesn't exist any more. You must establish contact to the great gods and other famous characters from the Greek mythology in order to restore the balance.

Like the previous games of the series, this is a standard console-style RPG with turn-based combat viewed from first-person perspective. There is a day/night cycle, which influences not only the appearance of the world map and the towns, but also the schedules of the world's inhabitants.</desc>

	<desc>The three RPGs (Hokuto no Ken 3-5) seemed to symbolize a genre change after the first two platformers, but the series changes the genre once again in the sixth installment, which is a fighting game similar to  Street Fighter II or  Mortal Kombat. The background story is based on the manga/animé of the same name. The years is 199X, and the world lies in ruins. Technology can no longer be used, and the land is controlled by fighters of rivaling styles.

	<name>Hokuto no Ken 7</name>
	<desc>Similar to the  sixth installment of the series, this is a fighting game along the lines of Street Fighter or Mortal Kombat. It is based on the main storyline of the manga/animé series Hokuto no Ken, also known as Fist of the North Star. 

After a terrible disaster mankind has stopped advancing the technology, and the world became a huge wasteland, controlled by fighter organizations. The main hero, Kenshirou of the Hokuto Shinken school, falls in love with a girl named Julia, who is abducted by one of the Nanto Seiken fighters, Shin. 

In the game, the player can choose to fight as various characters from the series, including Kenshirou, his brother Raou, the Emperor Souther, the leader of Nanto Seiken Rei, and others. There are three modes in the game: story mode, battle mode, and free fight mode.

1. In story mode, the player fights as Kenshirou in pre-determined battles that reflect the story of the series (like facing the assassin Heart). 
In battle mode, the player participates in a tournament by choosing one of the characters. 
In free fight mode, the player choses characters as well as the opponents. During battles, the player must first accumulate energy in order to unleash devastating techniques unique to each character.

	<path>./Holy Umbrella - Dondera no Mubou!! (Japan) (Translated En).mgd</path>
	<name>Holy Umbrella: Dondera no Mubo</name>
	<desc>In "Holy Umbrella", you control a schoolboy who lives in modern-day Japan. One day, the sky suddenly turns dark blue, a heavy rain falls onto the city, and the boy finds, halfway between his house and the school, an umbrella which seems to have fallen from the sky. What he does not know is that the umbrella is magical! The moment he touches it, he is transfered to a parallel universe. Immediately, he is attacked by a huge tank, but a strange old man with a talking bird saves him. It seems that an evil creature named Dondera is threatening the country with the terrible monsters she created. But is it really so? You visit the capital town, talk to the emperor, and decide to investigate the matter...

"Holy Umbrella" is essentially a platform action game, but unlike most other games of this genre, it allows you to visit towns, where you control your hero in a standard RPG-like top-down fashion. You can enter houses, talk to townspeople, etc. On platform levels, which are the main part of the game, you have to switch between the hero, the talking bird Bonto who accompanies you on your quest, and the girl Saki, whom you meet later in the game. Every character has his/her own special abilities and own ways of fighting: the hero can slide through air by using the umbrella, Bonto can double-jump on high ledges, Saki can jump on walls, etc. You use your umbrella as a weapon, as well as elemental stones you can collect on your way and throw at enemies. You also find various power-ups and items you can equip on the hero.</desc>

	<name>The Iron Commando</name>
	<desc>Iron commando is a brawler beat-em-up like Final Fight or Streets of Rage with lots of weapons and big end bosses.

The B-movie story is cheesy and does nothing more than accommodate for the action. From the introduction sequence: "The peril came from outer space. A meteorite entered the earth's atmosphere bringing chaos. After observation, the scientists found that the meteorite was radioactive and had to be destroyed. Unfortunately, terrorists from g.h.o.s.t. want the meteorite too. The Iron Commando's mission is to retrieve the deadly body and avoid genetic mutation."

The player or players walk along the levels beating up enemies. On some levels you ride a motorcycle or jeep, even a mine kart, and shoot your way through hordes of enemies. There are several end bosses, some are screen filling like a helicopter and a giant robot.

Some enemies will drop food, grenades or weapons as you beat them into a bloody pulp. There are lots of different Weapons: 9mm guns, shotguns, machine guns, knives, baseball bats. The weird thing is, enemies that use a sword and even dogs will occasionally drop a machine gun or baseball bat.

	<desc>Jaleco Rally: Big Run: The Supreme 4WD Challenge is a rally racing game and sim in which the player takes part in the Paris-Dakar rally. The game actually begins in Tripoli, Libya and passes through around 2,500 miles of African desert, swamp and jungle on the way to Dakar.Jaleco originally developed the game for the Arcades before porting it to the Super Famicom. This home version was never released outside of Japan. The game was also ported to the Amiga and Atari ST, where it is known simply as Big Run.GameplayIn addition to passing each checkpoint under the required time - the checkpoint system ubiquitous in solo racing games of the era - the player must also be aware of environmental dangers along the course and needs to select a sponsor, navigator and engineer team before starting. They must also balance the weight of their car, as too few replacement parts might cause a problem further into the race yet having too many will greatly reduce the car's top speed.</desc>

Jerry moves by sliding across the ground and can latch on to walls and climb them. Jerry can also jump, stretch out to cling to ceilings, and also move at a faster pace. Jerry can consume balls that he finds during a stage and can then fire them out of his body at enemies blocking his path. Enemies can also be defeated by jumping on them and then flattening Jerry's body on them. Also, there are flowers that contain items for Jerry to collect. Items include life, which refills health, a 1-up that adds an extra life, and a seed, which will grow a climbable beanstalk when planted. If the player collects the scattered letters that appear in every stage that spell out the name Jerry, the player will earn two extra lives.</desc>

	<path>./Jikkyou Oshaberi Parodius (Japan).mgd</path>
	<name>Jikkyou Oshaberi Parodius</name>
	<desc>The third in the Paroidus series, it's the same gameplay and zaniness that substantiated the first two games. Gameplay itself is a copy (a parody rather) of Konami's famous Gradius series in that the screen scrolls from left to right (most times) and you maneuver around the screen destroying waves of enemies and avoiding obstacles. Unlike previous Parodius titles, this game contains a difficulty adjustment option, allowing the player to make things easier... or harder. Also unique to this parodius title is a bit of japanese digital voice that shouts out various things at you while you play. Survival throughout the level earns you a boss fight, which frequently includes some of the strangest characters in the game. Make no mistake, this *is* Gradius,  but with all sorts of strange graphics, music and references to other Konami games... So in other words, it's Parodius!

There are now more power-ups than ever including the standard power-up (red, used to upgrade weapons), the shield power-up (blue) and a variety of different coloured bells. Green Bells will make you huge on the screen, Yellow Bells are worth points (points in turn are worth extra lives), Blue Bells are "big bombs" that clear the screen of enemies/shots and can be saved until you need them, White Bells will give your character a megaphone that will shout out japanese phrases, the characters of the phrases themselves can be used to damage enemies (the power of words!), The Red Bell stockpiles you with three point-defense lasers... only one of which can be activated at a time and disappear after a short while. Finally the purple bell will clear the screen of all but the strongest enemies... and will turn them into power-ups.

This time around there are 16 different characters to chose from and the power-ups and weapons that they use are more unique than ever. Several familiar "faces" return and they've brought along friends to share in the party:
Vic Viper: The "gradius ship" appears once again in this gradius parody, equipped with it's traditional gradius weapons
2. Lord British: The "other" Gradius ship and arguably the more famous of the two. Lord British has weapons similar to Vic but quite different also.Missiles and shields work differently for instance. And Lord British uses a Ripple gun instead of a double shot.
3. Pentaro: It just wouldn't be a Parodius game if Pentaro wasn't involved. Originally from Konami's Penguin Adventure, Pentaro retains the same abilities from previous Parodius games... however his Potion weapon may now hit multiple enemies and his normal weapon shots explode against obstacles
4. Hanako: Also from Penguin Adventure, Hanako the penguin is Pentaro's girlfriend. While Pentaro is blue, she is the red penguin. She plays nearly identical to Pentaro with the exception of her S. Bomb weapon
5. Twinbee: Twinbee, from the Twinbee games is another returning Parodius star. Unfortunately he hasn't been upgraded since previous games, so his weapons are nearly identical; Punching Glove Rocket and all...
6. Winbee: Winbee, also from Twinbee is red and has moves identical to Twinbee, except for one difference... when she has 3 Options available, she can power them up to harm enemies that touch them.
7. Tako: Again, it just wouldn't be a parodius game without a flying octopus. And here he is, still wearing a baseball cap, but otherwise unchanged from previous Parodius games.
8. Belial: A yellow female octopus with a bow in her hair, she is identical to Tako with the exception of her Missile and Double weapons... which are instead identical to the Vic Viper.
9. Soitsu: A stickman (now green) surfing aboard a paper airplane, Soitsu plays similar to Koitsu from the previous game, aside from his colour. His laser weapon is able to charge up to deliver more power and he drops little stickmen onto the ground which occasionally dance around rather than attacking. Additionally he has an "upgrade power" (S. Power) that make all his other abilities stronger
10. Doitsu: Similar to Soitsu but with a Double Laser ability. He is an orange stickman riding on a paper airplane and no "upgrade" power, using normal options instead
11. Upa: Upa aka The Flying Baby is back from the previous Parodius game (as well as his original game, Bokutte Upa) and plays nearly the same. Instead of a shield, he has a Mega Crush power that damages all on-screen enemies... and also has an "Upgrade Power" in the form of Grade Up that makes his other abilities stronger.
12. Rupa: Another flying baby (presumably also from Bokutte Upa), Rupa plays similar tot Upa but with a Multi Spread gun which fires missiles in multiple directions (with each upgrade) and a S.Vulcan gun which automatically aims towards enemies.
13. Mike: A cute little kitten who happens to to have a very powerful wave weapon which can travel through obstacles and enemies. Additionally he has a multiple bomb ability which requires his "upgrade ability" (Grade Up) to get really powerful
14. Rani: Another cute kitten (this one rolled onto his bottom facing forward) with very power weaponry. Some of the highlights include a Reflect weapon wherein the shots bounce off of obstacles. Another is the S laser which travels forward but then homes in Up or Down to hit the enemy. And finally, Rani's missile weapon is two homing bells. Rani also has an "upgrade ability" in the form of Grade Up, however it only upgrades the Reflect Shot.
15. Memim: One of the fairy characters, Memim is a female flying girl with standard female bikini clothing. She carries some unique missile weapons however, whose direction is determined by Memim's current location on the screen when fired.
16. Sue: The other fairy with tight clothing, Sue is unique in that her weapons are upgraded/displayed in a different order from everybody else's in the game. For instance her Option is the 4th weapon on the list rather than the 6th... requiring less power-ups to activate it. However aside from that... all of her weapons are the exact same as the Vic Viper's.</desc>

	<name>Jikkyou Power Pro Wrestling '96: Max Voltage</name>
	<desc>Step up to the ring with Jikkyou Power Pro Wrestling. As the name implies this is a wrestling game in which wrestlers from different leagues collide in grappling contests to determine who's the king of the hill.

Select your character with his unique stats and movesets, and go at it against any opponent from four fictional leagues with dozens of moves, submission holds and rope maneuvers in or out of the ring.

The game uses pre-rendered 2D sprites and features Vs, Tournament, and League play for up to four players. Also included is a career mode where you create a wrestler and control each aspect of his career up to his final victory in the inter-league tournament. And you can also configure matches to be standard, tag (with 4 or 6 wrestlers), submission or death-matches which adds such features as live wires and explosives to the ring.</desc>

	<name>Jojo no Kimy na Bken</name>
	<desc>One of the earliest titles based on the animé series Jojo's Bizarre Adventures, this game is not a pure fighter, like Capcom's more known title, but an adventure/RPG hybrid with turn-based fights.

In a futuristic world, there lives a young man named Jojo who holds a terrible power within: the power to drain life from enemies. This power is somehow connected to the evil vampire Dio who is terrorizing the world. Jojo must find faithful companions on his quest to restore peace and to master the power within himself.

In this game, you navigate Jojo in an adventure-like fashion, viewing the hero from third-person perspective. You can call up a menu at any time to choose a command such as "Look", "Talk", etc. Being a Japanese adventure, the game doesn't contain puzzles. from time to time, you'll be attacked by enemies and will fight them in turn-based combat viewed from first-person perspective. Jojo and his party members possess the so-called "stands", super-powerful creatures you summon during fights. before each fight, you'll have to choose one of fice available tarot cards to determine the amount of luck and compatibility of the stands you'll have in the game.</desc>

	<desc>Jutei Senki is a turn-based strategy game, never released outside of Japan. The game takes place in an alternate universe where centuries ago humanity and their tree soldiers called Junei fight against Letum, a race of robots powered by magic.

The player commands the human army. The mission in each battle is to defeat the enemy army or take their headquarters in a limited amount of turns. In the human army's main building, the player can recruit new soldiers, but their number is limited. Each unit has its own statistics, including range, speed and attack power. Battles are carried out automatically, with animations on a separate screen.

There are three mission modes which include Campaign, Tutorial, and Expert modes and there is also a two-player versus mode.</desc>

	<desc>Kikou Keisatsu Metal Jack is a scrolling brawler based on the anime of the same name. At the start of the game the player can choose from Red Jack, Silver Jack, or Blue Jack. Red and Silver both have weapons they can find ammo for in levels (a gun and baton, respectively), and all three can do a multiple hit combo or a jumping attack. At the end of a level the Jack will be met by his vehicle which will then merge with his armor. In this form the Jack's attacks are strengthened and he can charge up an attack that hits every enemy onscreen.

There is no story told at any point in the game, so if you want to know what's going on you'll have to track down the anime.</desc>

	<name>Kishin Douji ZENKI: Battle Raiden</name>
	<desc>Once already Chiaki and her reluctant demon servant Zenki have saved the world from the forces of darkness, but apparently once is never enough. Chiaki has a vision of five cloaked figures and knows that only she and Zenki can stop them. At once they set off to track down the demon leaders.

In Kishin Douji ZENKI: Battle Raiden the player takes the role of Zenki. At first, and occasionally through the game, Zenki will be in his powered down form where he can only punch, jump, and dash. After Chiaki recovers her bracelet, or regains her concentration, or whatever she needs to do at the time, she can transform Zenki into his powered up form. In this form Zenki deals more damage and has a much longer list of attacks that get added to as the game progresses, such as a pillar of energy, an electrified punch, and a dashing attack. By picking up scrolls Zenki can do a powerful Rudora attack to all enemies on screen, but this attack damages Zenki as well.

To complete platforming levels Zenki will have to make it to the end of the level while occasionally finding hidden stone monuments that, when destroyed, will drop items as well as alter the level or remove obstacles, allowing Zenki to pass. After a stage's first platforming level is a midboss fight, and after the second platforming level is the boss fight proper.</desc>

	<name>Kouryuu Densetsu Villgust - Kieta Shoujo</name>
	<desc>This game is based on the animé series Villgust. The main hero of the game is Shun, a teenager who lives in modern-day Japan. One day, when he was going back from school with his girlfriend Michiko, Shun noticed a strange red-eyed rabbit. When he tried to follow him, Shun suddenly found himself all alone in a forest clearing. He was immediately approached by a group of four adventurers who said they were members of a group called R.A.G.E. (Resistance Against God of Evil). Apparently, Shun was transported into a parallel medieval world, and an evil organization known as Vile was the one behind Michiko's kidnapping. Shun and his friends will now do anything to help Michiko and to destroy Vile!

This is a traditional console-style RPG. You travel on the world map, visit towns, buy equipment and items, descend into dungeons, and fight random enemies in turn-based combat viewed from a third-person "over-the-shoulder" perspective. The party can hold up to five characters. The characters level up in a standard way, and also get experience and new levels for their magical spells.

The tournament this time is an eating contest, and the game itself plays like a block-lining puzzle game in the grand tradition of Tetris and Puyo Puyo. You must line-up blocks of the same type as they fall in the classic rectangular play area, clearing them before time runs up or they fill the entire screen. Features a 1P tournament mode, and a 2P competitive Vs mode in which you can chain blocks and send them to your opponent as "attacks" in hopes of causing him/her to lose.</desc>

	<name>Kunio-kun no Dodge Ball da yo: Zenin Shgo</name>
	<desc>16-bit sequel to the cult-classic Super Dodge Ball which unfortunately only saw a Japanese release.

The game continues the "Worldwide Dodge Ball tournament" motif of the original in which several teams from around the world compete in side scrolling dodge ball matches to see which one is the best. Gameplay is similar to other sport games in which you control the character that has the ball at the time (although a lead character always marks the formations and generally controls the team), and special moves can be executed to try and eliminate your opponents (such as homing throws and other esoteric moves). 

This sequel also adds more comprehensive tournament mechanics, for instance your performance in each match allows you to buy power-ups and special moves to enhance your players, you can also create a custom team and manage them throughout the tournament by adding or removing members as you see fit (you can even try to lure players from opposing teams). You can also choose among a series of formations and AI profiles in case you play alone, although you can use a multi-tap to play with up to 4 players.

Available game modes include Tournament, Vs and Mechabutsuke mode which is a variation on Vs that involves a free-roaming court and no outfielders.</desc>

	<desc>You are a boy named Gulliver, who lives together with his two best friends - the girl Misty and the young inventor Edison - in Venice, Italy. The evil Prince of Spain, Judou, is after the mysterious Blue Crystals who grant immense power to those who possess them. Gulliver's father was apparently connected to the secret of the Crystals, and was mercilessly killed by Judou. Now Gulliver swears revenge and embarks, together with Misty and Edison, on a grand journey that will take him to several cities and countries all over the world, from Rome to Himalaya.

The game is an action RPG in which you can switch characters. Each one of the three heroes has his/her own attacks: Gulliver is a melee-style fighter, Edison can throw expendable bombs at enemies, and Misty can attack with magical spells. Whenever you switch to a different characters, the inactive characters in your party gradually regain their hit points. There are no weapons and armor to buy or to find in the game, but the character level up and become stronger from defeating enemies, and collect items those enemies drop.

	<name>Laplace no Ma</name>
	<desc>1924, the town Newcam, Massachusetts. On the outskirts of the town stands the Weathertop mansion. It was just an ordinary place until the last owner, Benedict Weathertop, started practicing black magic. He killed his parents and populated the mansion with all kinds of undead. Since then, nobody dared to approach the mansion. But a short while ago, two boys were found dead near this horrible place. Apparently, the boys had tried to enter the mansion. Another evidence pointed out that a girl followed them - but her body hasn't been found yet, and there is a slight hope she might be alive. 
This is where you, the hero of the game, decide to investigate the mystery, and to venture into the mansion...

"Devil of Laplace" is a hybrid between survival horror and traditional Japanese RPG, similar to the pioneer of this genre, Sweet Home for NES. Unlike "Sweet Home", this game has less puzzles and is more oriented towards RPG elements. You are not stuck in the mansion, but can leave it, visit the town, and buy supplies. Later you also visit other locations such as a castle, etc. The battles are random, turn-based, and are viewed from first-person perspective. The hero of the game can recruit three other characters to the party of five available. Each character (including the hero, to whom you assign gender and class) belongs to one of the five character classes: Dilettante, Medium, Detective, Scientist, or Journalist. Dilettante is an all-around character with defensive magic, Medium is a kind of a black mage, Detective is a melee fighter, Scientist can construct powerful machines to perform various techniques, and the Journalist can take pictures of the monsters, which is the only way to gain money in the game.</desc>

	<name>Lennus II: Fin no Shito</name>
	<desc>This is a follow-up to the game "Lennus", which is know outside of Japan as  Paladin's Quest. The game is set in a world of Andell - a floating continent where ancient prophecies and highly advanced technology co-exist. A curse has fallen onto Andell - its four island, once united, are now separated, and are floating away from the heart of the continent, the temple of Andell. The sages of the temple summon a great hero named Farse, who must find a special magic orb for each one of the islands, which is the only way to re-unite them. Farse embarks on his journey, aided by three Terranos, the big-eared inhabitants of Andell.

This is a console-style RPG where you control a party containing the main hero Farse and three Terranos you select out of the available five. You encounter random enemies and bosses and fight them in turn-based combat viewed from first-person perspective. You can use special attacks and magical spells, which don't consume magic points, but take away a certain amount of your hit points. Instead of healing items, you have mini-bottles you can refill with potions in special places in towns. You can equip various magical artifacts which will allow you to use magic spells belonging to eight different elements.</desc>

	<name>Little Magic</name>
	<desc>May is an apprentice mage at Magic School and must pass the final exam.

A puzzle game seen from a top-down perspective. The goal of each level is to open the exit by pushing a magic stone on a designated spot. May can also push objects one tile ahead without moving herself. This is often used to get the stone over water that she can't cross herself. May's other ability is to create magic bubbles. She can create bubbles in three different sizes. Bubbles will pop after a certain amount of time, depending on their size. If they pop while next to the stone or another bubble, the stone or bubble will be moved one space. Since May can create several bubbles simultaneously, it is possible, and often necessary, to create chain reactions to maneuver the stone into the desired position.

As the game progresses, levels become increasingly difficult and new hazards and enemies are introduced. Enemies follow a set movement pattern and can sometimes be stopped, but not destroyed by magic bubbles. Later levels are made more complicated by different types of tiles including: grass that slows down May, ice that May and the magic stone will slip over, spikes that destroy the stone if it is pushed into them, collapsing tiles that can only be walked over once, rune tiles on which May cannot create magic bubbles, teleporters and others.</desc>

	<desc>In "Live a Live", you control seven main characters and play through seven different stories set in seven different time periods: prehistoric age, medieval Europe, feudal Japan, a futuristic world with robots and weird machines, etc. Those stories appear to have no common points, yet after completing all of them, you'll see they are in fact connected - the worlds of all those characters are threatened by the same ultimate evil force.

The combat features many innovations compared to traditional console RPGs: your position on the battle field is important, and certain techniques can be used only from certain positions, and enemy attacks also affect only specific parts of the field. Out of the seven chapters, some have more battle-oriented gameplay, while others are more devoted to puzzle-solving and information-gathering.

The game is one of the least known Squaresoft products, and was never released outside of Japan.</desc>

Lode Runner Twin: Justy to Liberty no Daibouken is a side-scrolling platform game, adapted for the SNES from the original Lode Runner. However the atmosphere has changed to a lot more cartoonish and happy. Controlling either Justy or Liberty, the player is able to move back and forth, climb ladders, cross ropes and dig holes in some types of surface. The enemies then fall into these holes and the player can walk over them. The goal in each level is to get all the candy.

There is also a battle mode that puts Justy versus Liberty to see who can fetch the most candy.

	<desc>The game is set in the same universe and shares characters and storyline with  Puyo Puyo puzzle games. Unlike Puyo Puyo, Mado Monogatari is a Japanese-style RPG. You play Arle, a five-year old apprentice magician. She is attending a special kindergarten, and it is time for the Final Exam. At the same time, Arle receives a mysterious letter that tells her that if she finds eight magical gems and takes them to the Wizard Mountain, she'll be granted one wish. Arle decides to search for the gems which are scattered all over the world, and to overcome all the obstacles with her great magic power!

The game features random enemy encounters and turn-based combat, which takes place on a platform (Arle to the left, the enemies to the right). You can't perform physical attacks at all, and your only way of harming enemies is through magic. During the game, you learn a variety of magic spells, which can be upgraded later. In battles you can't see your own and the enemies' hit points, and have to act according to your intuition.

Within Toaru castle lies the Magic Gem which legend says can give the person who holds it great magical powers.  Because of this, it is sealed inside the castle to prevent the gem from landing in the wrong hands. 

One night, a dark figure and his army of monsters invades the castle and steals the gem. Armed with a sword and her magic powers, the Princess Toaru sets off to retrieve the gem and save the world.

Magical Pop'n let's you play a young, energetic little princess who is simply called...Princess. The game starts off with Princess chasing after a floating bad guy off a balcony and into town. 

Princess has two type of weapons: her sword and her magic powers. 

When using magic, Princess will consume star powers. Different types of magic requires a different number of stars. Stars can be collected throughout the game and you can also get stars after defeating a foe. In the first stage you will only have access to Princess' magic beam powers which shoots small beams of laser at enemies. Later, you will receive the ice, fire and other powers.

The sword can only be used to perform close range slashing against enemies. But it does not cost any stars.

In each stage, Princess will be confronted with a number of enemies that she must fight off to advance. There are many mini-bosses and at the end of a stage, you will have to fight the main boss.

Princess' health is indicated by the number of hearts she has in her health meter. There are various items that will help refill the meter: Candy refills half a heart, A slice of cake refills a whole heart and a birthday cake will refill the entire meter.

You will be taken to the game over screen if you lose all your lives. But, no worries, there's an unlimited number of continues. There is no save feature in the game.</desc>

	<name>Magna Braban: Henreki no Yusha</name>
	<desc>The Demon King and his monster armies have been attacking the human kingdoms in an effort to exterminate them all. One day a young boy named Alex is attacked by four monsters but is saved by a Knight of Anatea. Alex, the son of a shepard, grows up idolizing this knight and once the proper age, wishes to enroll in the Arena tournament, though his family forbids him. Entering the tournament Alex and two other warriors: Gina the Magician and Getz the Mercenary, all are defeated in the first round and sent to the Inn to recuperate. However during their absence, the Demon King plans a surprise attack on the Arena and kills everyone there. As the only surviving warriors from the tournament, Alex, Gina and Getz are mistakingly assumed to be strong enough to withstand monsters, and made knights by the King and given the mission of defeating the Demon King. They set out on an epic journey...

Magna Braban: Henreki no Yusha is a console-style RPG with party-based combat and random enemy encounters. The game's main view is an overhead map of a specific location, such as a town, where the characters move and can interact with NPCs. Upon leaving an area, the view changes to a larger overworld map showing locations of interest. The battles are viewed from an isometric perspective and the characters automatically engage and perform their actions. While the player does not directly control any of the characters, they can pause the battle at time and assign new strategies (such as melee, use long-ranged attacks or use Magic) to each character. Experience points and gold are awarded after each battle, the later of which can be used to purchase equipment and items.</desc>

	<path>./Mahou Kishi Rayearth (Japan) (Translated En).mgd</path>
	<name>Magic Knight Rayearth</name>
	<desc>This game is based on the anime and manga by manga artist CLAMP.

In the land of Cephiro, the world was kept in peace and harmony by the wishes of Princess Emauraude, the Pillar of Balance. But the evil priest, Lord Zagato, has kidnapped Emauraude, and Cephiro is being invaded by deadly beasts. If this continues, Zagato will gain complete control of Cephiro! The only ones who can stop him are the legendary Magic Knights...

And those Magic Knights are three young girls from Earth. Hikaru Shidou, Umi Ryuuzaki, and Fuu Hououjii have been plucked from modern-day Tokyo and brought to Cephiro by Emauraude, and they're the only ones who can defeat Zagato...as the Magic Knights!

This interpretation of the manga story is a traditional Japanese-style RPG. The player controls the three main heroines as a party; each one uses different weapons and learns various skills. Typically for the genre, the party roams the top-down world, visits towns, descends into dungeons, chats with non-playable characters, and fights randomly appearing enemies in turn-based style.</desc>

Peach and Yoshi should have been together with Luigi......but alas, the visage of Luigi was missing. Mario's group of three have separated to find lost little Luigi.

At once, the suspicious sound of an engine was in the air. I wonder what it could be? It was Wario riding his personal plane, the Bulldog, and it dropped a bucket from the sky.

"Whew, woosh!"

And suddenly, the bucket was a snug fit on Mario's head.

"Uwagh, I can't see in this thing!"

The sprite of the woods, Wanda, witnessed it. The petite pixie did not have the strength to remove the bucket on her own, but she desired to help somehow. Thus, Wanda sends Mario a signal with her magic wand, determined to reunite him with Luigi......</desc>

	<desc>Dr. Hell's robot army has destroyed Tokyo, and now only Kouji Kabuto, and the giant robot Mazinger Z, can stop them from taking over the entire world. Animated cutscenes between levels tell the story of the game.

The Mazinger Z comes with a full armory of anti-robot weaponry, from super-powered karate moves to missiles, Breast Fire, and its signature Rocket Punch. Special moves deplete a regenerating energy meter, while Rocket Punches can be preformed at any time, although Mazinger will be unable to punch until its arms return. Each level contains several varieties of enemies, all of them from the show and unique to each level, that must be defeated to progress. Some enemy robots will fire projectiles from a distance while others will rush in attempt to grapple the Mazinger, and sometimes more than one enemy must be fought at once. Enemies will drop healing items and occasionally an item that upgrades Mazinger's Rocket Punch to the Iron Cutter for a limited time. At the end of each level is a fight with a stronger boss robot with more dangerous attacks.</desc>

Your wish is to become a "hunter" - to kill monsters that roam the world and to receive rewards for that. The storyline and the gameplay basics remained unchanged in this remake. You fight enemies in turn-based combat, and use vehicles, such as your own personal tank Mosquito, to transport yourself through different areas, and to participate in battles. You can also buy equipment and upgrade your vehicles.

The remake features enhanced graphics and sound, background pictures for battles (they were black in the original), slightly different locations (more houses in towns, sometimes different layout of the towns and of the world map), and reduced difficulty level.</desc>

Hidden in levels are bombs that fill the screen with candy, turning any onscreen enemies into heart rings, fruit that increase health, and doors that lead to a celestial slot machine that can reward additional lives.

	<desc>The hero of the game is Fron, a sixteen-year old boy who lives on the island of Monstania. One day, strolling in the forest, he notices a strange light. The light lead him to a clearing, and then suddenly disappeared. But Fron realized what was the meaning of that light - it was a fairy! Of course, everybody knew that fairies had been long extinct, but Fron never believed in that. All his life he wanted to meet a real fairy, and now, when the opportunity has come, he firmly decides to find her. His girlfriend Tia helps him on the dangerous journey, during which they meet a mysterious little girl named Chitta, and get involved in a grand adventure, that will ultimately lead them to the battle against the dark force that threatens the whole Monstania!

"Monstania" has a somewhat unusual gameplay within the frames of console RPGs. You don't explore the world in the game: it is entirely linear and takes you to the next destination by itself (only at a few points you can choose where to go next by selecting an appropriate answer). Once within the location, you cannot leave it until you complete all your objectives there, which then take you to the next location. The objective is usually a large strategic battle. You navigate your party members on the battle field, attack with melee and long-ranged weapons, and use special technique which require action points. Unlike most other turn-based strategy games, an enemy makes a move immediately after you did the same with one of your characters, without waiting for the "enemy turn". The RPG element is not very significant: your characters level up automatically after each battle. There are also some puzzles to solve in certain locations.</desc>

	<name>Mystic Ark</name>
	<desc>Seven heroes from seven different Worlds. Seven heroes who were brought to a mysterious temple on a remote island and transformed into statues. Seven heroes who are chosen to bring harmony back to the universe: Miriene the witch (wizard), Lux the tetsujin (a race of iron people), Reeshina the grappler (monk), Tokio the ninja, Kamio the ogre, and Mesia the priestess. The seventh hero is you, the protagonist of the game - the knight Remeer or the female warrior Ferris. Your first task will be to release your companions from the statues they are locked in. You must travel to the Cat World and to retrieve an important artifact. But your main objective is to visit all the seven Worlds and to find seven mystic arks - the items that will re-unite those Worlds and bring peace to them.

"Mystic Ark" is a RPG closely connected to 7th Saga. You travel on overworld map, visit towns, buy equipment, and descend into dungeons. The combat is turn-based and viewed from a third-person "over-the-shoulder" perspective. The battles are not random: the enemies can be seen as white dots on your radar, and if you don't want to fight, you can sometimes outrun or avoid them. The game also contains elements of pure adventure: often you must investigate objects closely and use items from your inventory on them.</desc>

	<name>Nekketsu Tairiku: Burning Heroes</name>
	<desc>The young fighter Ryu was thrown out of his father's home, and this childhood trauma has been dominating his life ever since. His only wish is to surpass his father and to show him he has become a better fighter than him. Laila is a cheerful treasure hunter. She dreams only of valuable things, adventure, travels, and life in the capital city.  Gaou is experiencing a personal tragedy: he wants to discover the mystery of the disappearance of a woman he loved, Asuka, aided by his best friend Froz. Naaga is a girl who wears a heavy armor, which - as she thinks - will prevent her from losing any battle. At present, she has problems since she owes a million gold pieces to her guild. What do those heroes have in common? As their ways cross, they will find out they are in fact pursuing one and the same goal...

"Burning Heroes" lets you start as either one of the four characters. Each one starts in a different place and is seemingly absorbed in his/her personal quest, but as the game progresses, the four heroes meet each other. You should also find and "unlock" four other playable characters as you advance in the game. The gameplay system of "Burning Heroes" is similar to other console-style RPGs: you fight random enemies and bosses in turn-based combat, viewed from third-person perspective, like in Final Fantasy games. As you get hit in a battle, your "passion" (literally "hot blood", nekketsu in Japanese) level rises, and the more damage you take, the quicker you reach 100%. Once the passion bar is full, you can summon a powerful monster and to unleash a devastating attack on the entire enemy party.</desc>

	<name>Neugier: Umi to Kaze no Kodo</name>
	<desc>You play a man named Duke, the son of Count Wein of Neugier. Long time ago, Duke was exiled from the country by his father. Traveling in faraway lands, Duke heard that his homeland was under attack. He decided to return to Neugier. On the way his ship was attacked by pirates, lead by a mysterious demon named Ord. After he barely escaped the ship, Duke found his way into his father's castle. He realized now that the pirates' attack and the monsters roaming the castle are connected. Although his father doesn't trust him, Duke is determined to save Neugier.

"Neugier" is an action adventure game in which you fight enemies in real-time, slashing them with your melee weapon. You have a "throw chain" ability, which allows you to press objects to the walls, destroying them. You can also push enemies to the walls this way. Duke can also jump and equip armor you find sometimes in dungeons.

	<name>Ou-chan no Oekaki Logic</name>
	<desc>Ou-chan no Oekaki Logic is a digital conversion, with anime mascots, of the classic Japanese newspaper puzzle nonograms. A nonogram is a puzzle on a square or rectangular grid the object of which is to reveal a hidden picture. Along each row and column there is a number or series of numbers which indicate how many squares will be colored in that row or grid. Example; &amp;quot;5 9 4&amp;quot; would mean there would be sets of five, nine, and four colored squares in the grid, in that order, with at least one blank in between. 

Ou-chan no Oekaki Logic adds a story mode where Ou-Chan, representing the player, competes with other blobby anime characters in finding hidden images in the nonogram grids.</desc>

	<desc>All is not well on Yoshi's Island! The devious king Bowser has cast a spell on the island's inhabitants, turning them into his mindless slaves. Only Yoshi has escaped its effects, and so he must set off to free his friends, and to defeat Bowser and break the spell.

Tetris Attack is a fact-paced action puzzler featuring the colorful cast of characters from Yoshi's Island. A stack of blocks continually rises from the bottom of the screen, and the player controls a cursor which can swap any two blocks horizontally. Make a row or column of three or more and they'll clear, potentially creating combos from new blocks falling to take their place. Combos will send large garbage blocks to your opponent, which must be eliminated by clearing a piece that is touching it, turning it into normal blocks.

The game offers a story mode against the computer, as well as a 2-player versus mode, an endless mode, a timed mode where a certain number of blocks must be cleared, and a puzzle mode where a set arrangement of blocks must be cleared in a specific number of moves. The game is based on the Japan-only title Panel de Pon.</desc>

These penguins just want to live in peace, and throughout the story mode in the game they must constantly fight against people that want to capture them including poachers, witch doctors, and mad scientists.</desc>

	<path>./Pipe Dream (Japan).mgd</path>
	<name>Pipe Dream</name>
	<desc>Each level of this abstract puzzler challenges the player to set up a network of pipes to allow an unspecified substance known as 'flooz' to flow through as many of those as possible. The pieces are offered in random order, and there are seven different types - straight lines going horizontally or vertically, corners rotating in each of the four directions, and cross-over pieces which carry the flooz straight across horizontally and vertically. Each of these can be entered from either side. When the flooz hits a gap, or a piece which the previous piece can't flow into, the pipe is finished.

Before the flooz starts flowing from its randomly-selected starting position, the player has several seconds to start placing pieces. They can be put down anywhere. However a situation that can often occur is there will be a long and complex piping arrangement set up, yet a gap somewhere remains to be filled. Players are able to replace a piece with another in the same square (to make it easier to flow the flooz that way), but for a slight scoring penalty.

Bonuses are awarded for looping the flooz through both sides of at least 5 cross-over pieces, or passing the flooz through every square on the screen. Later levels have some squares on the grid blocked off, a few gaps in the side-wall (allowing flooz to thread to the other side of the screen). After every four levels there is a bonus game for points, in which the player can only place the pieces in the lowest open space in each column, similarly to the board game of "Connect 4".</desc>

	<name>Popful Mail</name>
	<desc>In this platform action game, you play as a cute bounty hunter known as Popful Mail. While you might think that a cute Anime chick would have no trouble making a living slashing bad guys with her sword, Popful is having a hard time making ends meet.  One day, however, Popful learns about a magician who has gone rogue and has a hefty bounty on his head. So, her adventure begins as Popful fights her way through a new adventure, and makes new friends along the way.

Primarily this is an action game with very slight RPG elements. As you make your way through the plethora of levels, you will have to collect money from slain foes. You use this money in the shops to buy weapons, armor, health, and so on. Also, this game features interaction with many, many characters through both on-screen dialog and fully animated sequences. Some of these characters become playable as you progress through the game.

This release has the same story and general gameplay style as the earlier version, but otherwise was made from scratch, having entirely different graphics, locations, enemies, challenges, etc.</desc>

	<path>./Ranma 1-2 - Akanekodan Teki Hihou (Japan) (Translated En).mgd</path>
	<name>Ranma 1/2 : Hidden Treasure of the Crimson Cats</name>
	<desc>The game is based on the animÃ© series Ranma 1/2. It tells the story of the young martial artist Ranma Saotome. Traveling with his father Genma across China, Ranma discovered a cursed spring. When he and his father fell into that spring, they were both transformed: Ranma into a little girl, Genma into a panda bear. Hot water restored them to their original appearance, but whenever they are splashed with cold water, they turn into their "cursed" forms. 

The story of the game begins as Ranma and Genma are having breakfast by their friends. Suddenly, several cat-like creatures burst in and kidnap Genma. Ranma finds out that the cats belonged to Akaneko (Crimson Cat) Gang, who kidnaps strong fighters for some reason. Soon Ranma discovers that Kamusaru, the leader of the Crimson Cat Gang, is looking for an ancient treasure that will allow him to turn into a Nekomaou (Cat Demon King), and take over the world. Ranma and his friends will do anything to rescue Genma and to stop Kamusaru's evil plans!

The game features many characters from the animÃ©, including Ranma's fiancee Akane, the fighter Ryouga, the amazon warrior Shampoo who is in love with Ranma, and others. The game is built like a traditional Japanese RPG: your party fights random enemies in turn-based combat viewed from a third-person, Final Fantasy-like perspective. In battles, you can attack physically, or use various offensive and defensive techniques, which consume "ki" (an equivalent of magic points). Not only Ranma and Genma, but also the other characters in your parties can take a different shape. You carry around a bucket of cold water, and every time you use it on one of your characters, he/she is transformed into a "cursed" form. This is sometimes required to advance the story of the game (for example, Ranma can enter a certain location only as a girl).

	<desc>Another fighting game based on the Ranma 1/2 manga series set around the misadventures of a martial artist that gets cursed and magically transforms into a female version of himself whenever he's splashed with water.

As in previous games the premise simply involves the cast of the series going at each other's throats for ultimate supremacy, although this time you can select any character in either the single player or Vs gameplay modes.

The gameplay itself involves controlling your character in a side-scrolling arena and trying to defeat your opponent either with your basic attacks, special moves (triggered by specific controller motions) or super moves that require you to charge buttons and can only be dealt under specific situations (ie, when your life-bar starts flashing), while avoiding your opponent's attacks in turn.

	<name>Ranma 1/2 : Chougi Ranbu Hen</name>
	<desc>A 2D one-on-one fighting game based on the Ranma 1/2 manga series dealing with the adventures of a male martial artist cursed to transform into a female version of himself when splashed with water.

Ranma 1/2 : Chougi Ranbu Hen pits 12 characters from the series (including the male and female versions of Ranma) against each other in best 2-out-of-3 rounds matches, with the goal being to defeat all the opponents and thus claim a magical lucky cat that will grant the champion whatever he wishes.

Gameplay involves controlling your character in a 2D scrolling arena, in which you attempt to defeat your opponent by using your basic attacks and special moves, all the while avoiding your opponent's strikes. You can also charge up your character until he reaches "super" mode, which allows you to unleash super moves for extra damage, but performing any basic attack negates the super mode.

Features the standard single player and Vs modes along with a Tag Team Vs mode in which two players select a pair of characters and can exchange them in mid-fight for strategic advantage.</desc>

	<name>Ranma 1/2 : Ougi Jaanken</name>
	<desc>The game involves falling blocks of hands displaying the rock, paper, and scissors signs, which fall three at a time. In a similar manner to Tetris, the player can rotate the blocks to stack them, using pieces that defeat other pieces (e.g. paper over rock) to eliminate stacks. Doing so adds garbage pieces onto the opponent's screen to make it more difficult for them to eliminate their stacks of blocks. The objective is to fill up the opponent's screen up with blocks so that additional ones can no longer fit. Each character has two special attacks which can be used when large combinations are completed. Once in each round each player can also use a bucket of water that can transform a cursed character into their alternate form, which weakens their attacks until the effect wears off. This does not affect Akane or the Gambling King.</desc>

But remember, Dr. Wily is mad, but he's not stupid. He had a backup plan...and all he had to do was just wait...

6 months had passed, and somewhere from deep within Wily's abandoned lab, 4 hidden capsules activated and opened. His backup plan was in action...he had hidden 4 new Wily Robots that would spring him out of jail so he could continue his mad reign.

When Mega Man hears the word that Wily was busting out of prison, he rushes onto the scene, only to encounter a strange robot he had never seen before named Bass. Bass tells Mega Man to back off, that he would stop Wily, and that Mega Man was no longer needed.

Think that's gonna stop Mega Man? No way! Mega Man takes off to put a stop to Dr. Wily and find out exactly whose side Bass is on...</desc>

	<path>./Romancing SaGa (Japan) [En by Trans Dimension v0.40] (Incomplete).mgd</path>
	<name>Romancing SaGa</name>
	<desc>Once upon a time, three evil gods fought against the holy gods, and the holy God-Father chose a human warrior to help them. Finally, after a prolonged, terrible war, the leader of the three evil gods - Death, the eldest of them - surrendered. The youngest evil god, Schirach, became a human and has lost her powers. The middle one, Saruin, was sealed away in the dark world. Now, after thousand years have passed, and the seal of Saruin has weakened, it is time for you, the hero of the new generation, to defeat him.

Romancing SaGa is the fourth installment in the long SaGa series - non-linear role-playing games with several main heroes. It is the first of three Super Nintendo entries. The first three games in the series were on the Gameboy and were known as "Final Fantasy Legend" outside of Japan. In this game, you play the stories of eight characters, which will later unite to face the ultimate evil. The eight characters belong to different classes and have different abilities. There are four male characters (noble son, thief, adventurer, and pirate), and four female ones (nomad, ranger, dancer, and savage). The combat is turn-based, with enemies visible on screen. Taking a cue from Final Fantasy II on the NES, instead of "Leveling" your character as a whole you level specific abilities such as a type of weapon or magic, as well as, stats such as HP and Strength and Intelligence. New to this entry abilities are randomly unlocked during battle as a light-bulb appears over the characters head and the new ability is unleashed to the surprise of friend and foe. This serendipitous element of gameplay along with the multiple heroes to choose from greatly enhance the replay value as no two playthroughs are alike. Which is good considering the steep learning curve of the SaGa games which require multiple playthroughs to truly master the system.

"Romancing SaGa" was never released outside of Japan until the Playstation 2 remake "Romancing SaGa: Minstrel Song"</desc>

During the next Eclipse, a chosen child became a holy king, and he defeated the evil demon king. Now, when the next Eclipse is nearing, nobody knows who the next fortunate survivor will become - a demon or a holy man?

In "Romancing SaGa 3", you can play through the story controling any one of the eight main characters - Julian, Monica, Mikhael, Harid, Katarina, Thomas, Elena, and Sarah. The story is common for all eight characters, and they often join together and share the same piece of a story. The princess Monica learns about a rebellion planned by a treacherous Baron to dethrone her brother, Marquis Mikhael. She goes to warn him, but on her way, she loses her horse, and has to stop in an inn of the town Shinnon. There, she meets travelers who agree to lend her a horse and accompany her to see her brother. When they finally reach Mikhael, a war begins...

"Romancing SaGa 3" has a refined upgrading system: you can upgrade your weapons and your spells by using them continuously. The party combat is turn-based, and there are also strategic army-vs.-army battles you'll have to command.</desc>

	<name>Rudra no Hihou</name>
	<desc>The Earth is ruled by heavenly powers, who destroy it and create it again every 4000 years, to end the live of powerful races and to let new ones appear. Many years ago, four great races dominated the Earth: the wise Danans, the beautiful Mermaids, the proud Reptiles, and the strong Giants. But those races had to give place to a newly born race: the humans. During the era of the humans, the planet's air has become filled with smog and the water dirty with pollutants. The cult of the Rudra have appeared and begun fortelling the end of the world. As the 4000 year deadline approaches, three characters each embark on their separate yet intertwined quests.

Sion is a young warrior who wants to take part in a ritual tournament and become the strongest of the kingdom. However a capture of one of the Cultists of Rudras soon complicates his training.

Surlet is a wise magician who is interested in archeology and history of the Earth. He is also a pupil of the famous professor Muench who recently made a very important discovery regarding ancient ruins

Riza is a young druid who lives with her grandfather in a quiet village. She was born with a mysterious jade on her forehead, and now feels the urge to save the world from an inevitable, yet unknown disaster.

Rundra no Hiho is a turn-based RPG, similar in gameplay and graphics to the better known Final Fantasy VI. Whenever players load the game cartridge, they are able to choose which of the three characters they wish to play. This allows any one of these quests to be saved and put aside for any amount of time, allowing the player to change between characters as they so desire. Regardless of which character is chosen, the game is displayed as a top-view on the overworld and in towns. Players can move around to different locations, search treasure chests and talk to townspeople. On the overworld and in dungeons, random encounters can occur. During battles the game is displayed from a side-view and is turn-based between the player's characters and monsters. Players are able to Fight with their weapon, use mantras (magic), use items, defend or run away. Defeat of monsters will result in the party earning experience points and money, which can be spent to buy new weapons, armor and items.

The game's mantra (magic) system is unique in that all spells are formed up of syllables, each with it's own effect (for instance, the syllable "Ig" represents fire and the syllable "ga" augments any mantra's power over it's basic form. Therefore "Igga" is a more powerful version than "Ig" alone). Syllables must be arranged in proper combinations in order to form effective magic spells. Hints towards some of these combinations can be found inside treasure chests or by talking to townspeople.

	<name>Art of Fighting 2</name>
	<desc>In this sequel to the original Art of Fighting, and prequel to the original Fatal Fury, we learn that Mr. Karate, the final boss of the original game, behind the mask, is really Takuma Sakazaki, Ryo and Yuri's father, that Takuma was being used by Geese Howard for his own evil intentions, and that Mr. Big was the one who had originally kidnapped Yuri.

Many of the problems that existed in the first game have been fixed in this installment (it is easier to execute special moves, you no longer have only Ryo or Robert to choose from in 1 player mode, etc.).

The entire cast from the first Art of Fighting is here (with the exceptions of Todo and Mr. Karate), along with a few new characters: Takuma Sakazaki, Ryo and Yuri's father; Yuri Sakazaki, Takuma's daughter and Ryo's sister; Eiji Kisaragi, a sworn enemy of the Sakazakis; Temjin, a Mongolian trucker; and a younger version of Geese Howard, whom you face as the last boss if you beat the game without losing a round.</desc>

	<name>Seiken Densetsu 3</name>
	<desc>Seiken Densetsu 3 is set in the same world as the two previous Seiken Densetsu games (the first is Final Fantasy Adventure, and the second is most known as Secret of Mana). The mysterious power of Mana is also the center of all events in Seiken Densetsu 3. Years have passed, and all the destructive powers of Mana have been securely sealed by Mana Swords into eight seeds, all placed in eight different kingdoms. But some people know about those sealed powers, and they don't want to free them for the sake of humanity, but for their own gain - such as the kingdom of Altena, which is slowly freezing and which can be saved only by the legendary powers.

The game features several plot lines connected to each other by their common background. In the beginning of the game, you are offered to choose a group of three among six different characters of different classes: Duran the Fighter, Angela the Magic User, Lisa the Amazon, Carlie the Cleric, Kevin the Grappler and Hawk the Thief. Each one of them has her/his own background story and dwells in a different land. Gradually, the connections between those different characters become apparent, and the seemingly loose story lines are connected into a whole.

Seiken Densetsu 3, like the previous game of the series, is an action RPG, with real time combat.</desc>

	<desc>A 2D side-scrolling beat 'em up, Sengoku casts you and a friend as two renegade fighters out to beat the crap out of the many assorted gangs that threaten the post-apocalyptic cities of the future. Unfortunately for them they also get caught in a time-warping scheme caused by the evil Nobunaga who attempts to invade the time period with mythical warriors and evil creatures from the Japanese sengoku period.

The game thus takes you from the city to a spirit-realm from time to time, in which you must fight all sorts of Japanese mythical figures, and release three haunted spirits that can aid you in your battle. Collecting orbs from defeated enemies allows you heal up, gain weapons and even energy attacks and also summon the warrior forms of the spirits you released, which change your character's form and give you a new collection of attacks and powers.

A spirit appears in front of him and asks him his name. As he proceeds further, he meets a man who is hanging on a cross, another one who is being tormented by a demon, and a mysterious young woman who is bathing in a pool...

"Wake up!" - the voice of his mother cuts through the dream. The young man wakes up and checks his computer. Suddenly, a message arrives: the world is headed towards destruction. Only he who can summon demons through a virtual space will be able to prevent a disaster. What could that mean? The young man goes outside and finds out a murder has occurred in the nearby park. The district must be cut off from the rest of the city until the murderer is found. This was the beginning of the demon summoner's story...

The events of this game take place 20 or 30 years after the hero of the first game followed the neutral path, defeated the Asura Lord and the seraph Michael at the Cathedral, and founded a state where followers of both Law and Chaos ideals could live freely. But his reign of freedom doesn't last long. The Mesia faith gains power, expanding the Cathedral into a new enclosed environment named Millenium. The Gaians rise up, but their rebellion is repressed by the Mesians' elite warrior class, the Temple Knights. Some years later, a retired arena fighter Okamoto discovers a man fighting for his life against a demon. He rescues the man, who doesn't even remember his own name, and trains him to fight in the arena so they might both go on to a better living in one of the upper-class areas of Millenium. And thus the new battle for a better future begins...

"Shin Megami Tensei II" features all the gameplay innovations of the previous game. You can summon demons, fuse them, make them battle for you, talk to random enemies and receive information from them, etc. The combat is turn-based, and you explore the dungeons from a first-person perspective view.</desc>

	<name>Shin Nekketsu Kouha Kunio-kun: Kunio-tachi no Bank</name>
	<desc>Another beat 'em up in the Nekketsu Kouha Kunio-Kun series. 
The eternal rebel Kunio and his pal Riki finally get to face the long arm of the law when they get both arrested for killing a couple of bystanders in a hit-and-run incident. Problem is they are innocent and the lookalike killers are still out there! Kunio and his pal now have to break out of the prison and go kick some butt in the name of justice (and to clear their names of course).

Gameplay involves defeating all opponents using your arsenal of attacks and special moves (as well as any weapons you may find around) and completing the many side scrolling stages that make up the game, usually after beating an end level boss.

Kunio and Riki are not alone in their quest, as their hard boiled girlfriends, Misako and Kyouko, can join up and provide their unique collection of special moves to the mix. Biking sequences in which you try to get to another part of town while fending-off opponents Road Rash-style are also added for additional gameplay and the game uses several non-interactive cutscenes and dialogues to carry the plot forward.</desc>

	<name>Shounen Ashibe</name>
	<desc>Shounen Ashibe: Goma-chan no Yuuenchi Daibouken (lit: "Boy Ashibe: Goma-chan's Great Amusement Park Adventure") is a Super Famicom platformer from Nova Co. and Takara. The player alternates between controlling the human Ashibe, as he escorts his friends across a world map while talking to NPCs and following the game's story, and the seal Goma-chan in 2D platformer stages where he must track down eight items by investigating his surroundings thoroughly. While Goma-chan can't be hurt by enemies, colliding with them causes him to lose one of the eight items he's already found - as the stages have a strict time limit, it's best to avoid this situation whenever possible.

Shounen Ashibe was originally a Shounen Jump serialized manga before becoming an anime TV series in 1991, a year before this game was released.</desc>

The player, as the eponymous ninja, must rescue the daughter of a local lord by fighting his way through hordes of masked bandits led by a mysterious warlord. A second player can join in as Sasuke's monk friend Chin-nan. The game has a distinct sense of speed and verticality, and it's recommended that the player(s) try running and jumping around performing aerial attacks rather than staying on the ground and getting quickly swarmed by enemies.The game was published by SunSoft and developed by an unknown developer, though Mint is thought to have contributed to its sound design. A US SNES localization, with the title Boy Ninja Sasuke, was briefly considered but then axed.</desc>

	<name>Slayers</name>
	<desc>"Slayers" is based on an manga series of the same name (also known as Lina the Teenage Sorceress). The heroine of the manga (and of the game) is Lina Inverse, a seventeen-year-old girl who can use magic and is also proficient with the sword. Lina particularly likes money, and often robs rich people and hunts for treasure. She also has a sense for justice - if a village or a town is in trouble, Lina will do anything to protect it and to fight the bad guys! In the game, Lina is knocked down after a fight against mysterious attackers, and is found by the inhabitants of the nearby village. The trouble is, she can't remember anything! When she meets her long-time companion Naga, their first objective become to investigate the goblin attacks on the population, but Lina's ultimate quest is to regain her memory and to find out who or what has attacked her.

The game is a traditional console-style RPG with towns, dungeons, random enemies, and turn-based combat viewed from first-person perspective, in a Dragon Warrior fashion. The characters can attack physically or use special attacks. Lina can also cast various magical spells. You cannot travel on the world map, but "jump" to various locations instead. The game features animé-style cut scenes.</desc>

	<desc>The game is a less of a self-contained game and more a collection of four smaller ones; including a point-and-click segment featuring Schroeder. The player controls Woodstock and direct Snoopy as he performs all sorts of errands for different Peanuts characters. The player does a separate game for each character; some of them require him to do a little detective work, or to direct Snoopy to win a race, or to get a character to some place. The ultimate goal in the game is to get everyone in shape for Snoopy's concert. Games can either be played using stereo or monoaural sound.

The music was composed by Hirokazu Tanaka (?????)[2] and Minako Hamano (??????),[2] in addition to arrangements of the familiar works of Vince Guaraldi known to longtime Peanuts fans. Many years later the game has been translated to English (by Aeon Genesis) and Portuguese.</desc>

You must reach the end of each stage before time runs out, and get all the power-ups and items laid in each maze in hopes of getting to Goemon alive.</desc>

	<name>Super Aleste</name>
	<desc>Compile's Aleste series lands on the SNES with the appropriately named Super Aleste. Taking the role of a lone starfighter pilot, you are tasked with destroying an evil alien armada in standard 2D shooter fashion. And while you may be alone, you certainly won't be underpowered, with eight different types of weapons, each having six power-up levels for a grand total of 48 firing modes (not counting bomb power-ups) Super Aleste boasts one of the largest arsenals in 2D shooter history.

Gameplay is single-player only with 3 difficulty levels. Also included is a short campaign with different levels that plays mostly like a "survival" mode with the objective being to outlast the time limit and rack the most points.

A small twist in this game is that instead of choosing the traditional bomberman or a country specific character players get to choose between bosses from the previous game when playing battle mode. Each character has a special power from a jet pack to throwing abilities.</desc>

	<name>Super Fire Pro Wrestling - Queen's Special</name>
	<desc>Long before the WWE introduced the Divas wrestling matches, in Japan there was a more serious affair, where wrestling skill was more important than breast implants, and matches were "real" (as far as wrestling goes) instead of pillow-fighting or bra and panties fights.

In this game in the Fire Pro Series, the cast of the All Japan Women's Pro-Wrestling promotion are available, all fighting to win the Red belt, the highest prize of the federation. It's also possible to fight in single matches, tournaments, Battle Royal and Elimination matches. The usual array of options in CAW is present, being possible to create 16 new Wrestlers.

Gameplay, as usual is the series, is dramatically different than in most western games. Each wrestler has a bunch of moves, ranked from weak to strong. While it's possible to connect any of them from open situations, while grappling only when the opponent is already beaten the most powerful moves can be successfully used.

	<name>Super Fire Pro Wrestling Premium X</name>
	<desc>In this final appearance of Fire Pro series on 16-bit consoles, the usual roster of over 150 wrestlers from several wresting promotions worldwide including several styles from Shoot or Pancrase to American and Lucha are joined by 80 Create-a-wrestler slots, plus secret wrestlers such as legends Gotch or Thesz or the roster of Blazing Tornado. While all fighters have fictional names, a lot of them are perfectly recognizable by their attire, stance and style. The CAW mode allows the player to create a wrestler from scratch, setting how they look (choosing face, size, clothing and setting colours) and fight, with several styles and stances available, as well as over 500 moves, each more suitable for certain styles and skills. To make them fight more realistically when controlled by the AI, the CAW mode also allows one to set move priorities.

Five game modes are available, including World Championship (single and tag), Battle Royale, 5-man Elimination Mode, League Battle and the One Night Dream Match. There are several referees available (each with their own quirks) and variant rules, from allowing fighting outside the ring without count-out (or disallowing it) to the disabling of disqualifications from illegal moves.</desc>

	<name>Super Nazo Puyo - Rulue no Roux</name>
	<desc>A spin-off of the successful action puzzle series Puyo Puyo with a twist. Whereas the main Puyo Puyo games are aimed at defeating AI or human controlled opponents in puzzle duels (where each player has his own play area in which color-coded "puyos" fall and must clear them out faster than his opponent). Nazo Puyo instead challenges the player with different single-player scenarios in which a specific objective must be completed (such as clearing only the red Puyos, or performing a specific sequence of combos, etc.).

The game uses the mold of a top-down RPG in which you control the young magician Arle as she explores towns and dungeons in her search for adventure. Each quest involves finding an NPC who will trigger one of the aforementioned scenarios and rewards Arle with experience points and unique items that increase her stats.

	<desc>Sequel to the original Super Nazo Puyo, SNP2 is a Puyo Puyo spin-off which combines arcade puzzle elements with RPG gameplay.

You play as the young magician Arle as she sets out looking for adventure all over the land, chatting with NPCs and exploring the game world via a standard top-down RPG interface. Quests involve careful exploration and solving Nazo Puyo challenges which involve specific scenarios of puzzle-based gameplay which the player must solve under a specific timeframe. These sequences give the player a play area in which color-coded "puyos" are pre-arranged in different patterns, and the player must position and arrange the ones that start to fall in order to fullfil the objective at hand (clear only a certain row or color of puyos, reach a certain number of combos, etc.). Additionally, running into specific monsters can trigger standard Puyo Puyo duels, in which both players have their own play areas and the objective is to clear the screen faster than the opponent.

As in the original, the game features a Competition (free tournament) or Conquest (clear each table in succession) modes, but the hotseat multiplayer component has been reduced to two-players. Graphics are 2D representations of the tables viewed from a tilted 3D view, which manages to fit the entire tables on the screen without scrolling.</desc>

	<name>Super Soukoban</name>
	<desc>Super Sokoban (or Soukoban) is a puzzle game in which the player must push crates around a maze to their designated storage area, ensuring they do not accidentally push a crate into a position where it cannot be recovered. Thinking Rabbit created the original game in 1982 on home computers, and Super Sokoban is the first Super Famicom game to follow the same blueprint.

The intro establishes that the eponymous Sokoban, or warehouse worker, must perform enough box-pushing puzzles to earn enough cash for a flashy new car so that he might finally impress the girl of his dreams.

An added wrinkle is that each stage has a fixed move limit, and so the player must not only push the boxes in the right order but do so with maximum efficiency. The game was not released outside of Japan.</desc>

	<name>Super Tetris 2 + Bombliss</name>
	<desc>Super Tetris 2 + Bombliss is one of the many versions of the famous soviet puzzle game, the first one available for the Super Nintendo, and an updated version of Tetris 2 + Bombliss.

As the title would suggest, the game features both standard Tetris as well as another similar game called Bombliss. Tetris offers three game modes: standard marathon (A-type), start with garbage (B-type), and rising garbage (C-type). There is also a two-player versus mode where clearing rows sends garbage to the other player.

Bombliss is slightly different from normal Tetris. Arranged on the board and in some dropped pieces are bomb squares. Completing a row does not clear the blocks in the row, but will trigger any bombs in the row which will destroy blocks. Different sizes of bombs will generate larger explosions. Bombliss is offered in standard marathon mode, a puzzle mode where a set board must be cleared using set piece drops, and a 2-player versus mode.</desc>

	<name>Super Tetris 3</name>
	<desc>Super Tetris 3 is yet another version of the famous soviet puzzle game. However, despite what the title may suggest, contained within are actually four different versions of Tetris: Tetris Classic, Familiss, Sparkliss, and Magicaliss. Tetris Classic, of course, is the basic version of the game, which comes with an endless mode and a 25-line "standard" mode. Familiss, as the name might suggest, is a family mode for up to four players simultaneously. Sparkliss, meanwhile, is very similar to Bombliss from Super Tetris 2, only with a medieval fantasy theme and different explosion patterns. Sparkliss includes both a stage mode and a puzzle mode.

The most unique mode is Magicaliss, which has never shown up on any other version of Tetris. In Magicaliss, pieces come in three basic colors, and by rotating the piece, the player can choose between them. Creating a line entirely out of one color will clear all blocks on the screen of that color. There are also grey pieces, which can only be cleared by creating a line made entirely from one color, which will cause all grey blocks on screen to become that color. There are also rare rainbow pieces which will act as any color. Besides these additions, the game itself is basic Tetris.

Tetris Classic, Sparkliss, and Magicaliss can also be played in a two-player battle mode, besides the four-player Familiss mode.</desc>

	<name>Tales of Phantasia</name>
	<desc>In "Tales of Phantasia", you play a young boy named Cless, who lives together with his parents in a quiet village. It was a day like all the others when Cless decided to go hunting with his best friend Chester. Chasing a wild boar, Cless discovered a strange talking tree in the forest who was pleading him for help. But as soon as it stopped speaking, the two friends heard the sound of an alarm. They returned to the village and found it burnt down, and all its inhabitants murdered. Before Cless' mother died in his arms, she told him this terrible massacre had something to do with the pendant she and her husband gave Cless for his birthday... what connection could there be? Cless decides to visit his uncle who lives in another town, but he doesn't realize his journey will take him to much more remote places than that!

"Tales of Phantasia" presents a unique combat system: The battles have a lot in common with fighting games: you fight on a platform that slowly scrolls forward and have to attack your enemy in real time. Other party members are controlled by AI. You can pause the game at any time and use magic, items, or choose an overall strategy for your allies.</desc>

	<name>Tenchi Muyou ! Game-Hen</name>
	<desc>Sasami is kidnapped by a mysterious little girl with magical powers, and Tenchi and his companions must travel to rescue her, battling monsters and other creatures on the way.

Tenchi Muyou! Game-Hen is a strategy game with RPG elements, based on the popular Japanese Tenchi Muyo! cartoon series. The game moves from battle to battle, with the plot being revealed through cutscenes between them. The player fights the computer on turns, controlling the individuals from a party of four. The party members are selected on a separate screen before each battle, and as the game progresses new characters become available.

During the skirmish, selecting the characters brings up a menu with three command options: move, attack or end turn. A fourth transform option becomes available later, after they reach a higher level. When moving or attacking, glowing tiles on the ground show the maximum range of the action. Performing either one costs action points, shown as eight regenerating green dots on the status window, alongside basic statistics like health, defense and attack levels. Characters level up automatically while on the battlefield, increasing their abilities and receiving more powerful attacks. Health powers are also accessed through the attack menu, recovering lost points to an ailing comrade within their range. Characters can transform to a more powerful version when they have the ability to do so, and all the eight green dots are still available. The transformed unit has more powerful attacks and a wider range of movement.

After the battle, a map screen appears where the player can save the game, and choose the next battle from one of the available paths. It is possible to revisit battlegrounds, to level up before tackling stronger enemies.

	<name>Torneko no Daibouken - Fushigi no Dungeon</name>
	<desc>Torneko (aka Taloon) from Dragon Quest IV was a merchant and treasure hunter who always dreamed of owning his own shop. Having defeating the evil along with other heroes, he returned to Endor to work peacefully. Some time has passed and after growing successful in this town, Torneko grew anxious. Hearing rumors one day about a "Mysterious Dungeon", Torneko meets with the king to ask permission to set up a new shop, closer to this Mysterious Dungeon. By exploring this cavern and returning safely with the prizes, Torneko hopes to become the most successful merchant in the world.

Torneko No Daibouken is a overhead view game similar to Hack, what might be called a "dungeon crawl". Torneko must venture into the mysterious dungeon gathering treasure. He may equip any weapons and shields he finds there, as well as gather up items such as spell scrolls, staffs and herbs with a variety of effect. A variety of enemies, familiar to the Dragon Quest series, await him. If Torneko successfully exits the dungeon, he is able to sell any of the items he has collected. This money then goes to improve the quality of his shop and living quarters. As the game progresses, Torneko is able to store special items in the vault, which he is then able to bring with him on subsequent trips to the dungeon.</desc>

	<name>Treasure Hunter G</name>
	<desc>Brothers Red and Blue G. decide to leave their idyllic village in search of their long lost father, who left the kids years ago to go treasure hunting. Unfortunately, as soon as they begin their quest, they become entangled with a mysterious girl on the run from evil monsters who holds the key to the resurrection of a great demon. Now its up to the brothers to save the world if they ever want to find their father.

Treasure Hunter G is a top-down RPG in which you control your party of four characters as they explore the fantasy/sci-fi game world in search for quests and grinding their stats while the plot advances. The game is divided in a world-map screen, a top-down "town" mode and a turn-based fight mode in which the characters are taken to generic tiled top-down arenas in which they select each character and move or attack depending on their action points.

Enemies can be seen on the map instead of jumping at you at random intervals, and you can freely decide whether to engage them or simply circle them around. The game uses a combination of hand-drawn sprites and CGI pre-rendered one (mostly for the main characters) with a distinct cute or Super Deformed design (as usual for most console RPGs).</desc>

	<name>Uch no Kishi: Tekkaman Blade</name>
	<desc>Uchu no Kishi: Tekkaman Blade's is based on the anime Tekkaman Blade, also known as Teknoman. The game's levels are a mix of scrolling shooter and fighting game. The first part of every level is a scrolling shooter where Tekkaman Blade must survive several waves of Radam before killing two stronger boss-like Radam and meeting another Tekkaman. In scrolling shooter levels Blade can either toss his spear to defeat enemies at range or quickly slash with it to destroy bullets and enemies. One enemy type will drop different colored System Box powerups: green restores health, red destroys all enemies onscreen (except bosses), and blue turns Blade invulnerable and able to destroy all enemies upon contact (including bosses).

The end of every level is a one on one fight with an enemy Tekkaman. Each Tekkaman starts with a weapon, but the weapon will be lost if they take too much damage, forcing them to use punches and kicks. This mode can also be played in 2-player mode, where each player selects their Tekkaman.</desc>

Equipped with a fishing line she can swing and abseil from platform to platform using it as a grappling hook. The game's specialty is the detailed physics system that allows Kawase to perform various tricks using the elastic and length variable rope to move around the levels. There are almost 50 fields (levels) but most have multiple exits that allow you to play through the game on different paths without playing every single field in order. You can also record a good game and save it to watch it again at a later time.</desc>

	<name>Wonder project J</name>
	<desc>There was once a great scientist and inventor named Gepetto, who lived on an island farm together with his creations, his robotic helper, the pixie Tinker, and his pet animals. His greatest creation was an artificial boy named Pino. No, he was not carved from wood, but looked just like a real boy - only he could turn his head 360 degrees. But Gepetto was arrested for an unknown reason. The boy Pino looks like a real boy, but he was completed just a few moments ago, and he knows absolutely nothing. All he can do is wander aimlessly, poking objects and turning his head. It is up to you, the player, to make Pino a real man!

In this simulation/role-playing game, you must use the robotic pixie Tinker to educate Pino. You can move Tinker around, examining objects and collecting them in an adventure-like fashion. Pino will automatically follow you to the direction you are facing, but will continue walking until you stop him. He will also pick objects and make his own "experiments" with them. Your goal is to train PIno in various disciplines. His stats can be raised in a RPG style: reading books increases his intelligence, throwing a ball increases his dexterity, and so on. By praising or scolding Pino you will gradually make him understand what should be done and what not.

	<desc>After having defeated the ultimate evil in his previous adventure, the great hero Adol stands on a sea shore, thinking about the fate of the once peaceful Utopian land of Ys, while the wind is blowing through his red hair. Suddenly, Adol notices a bottle, thrown onto the shore. It contains a letter, written in a foreign language, in which an unknown person asks Adol to come to his land and save it from a mysterious evil. Adol decides to accept the offer, and thus his adventure begins again...

Ys IV: Mask of the Sun is an action RPG with a combat system like the earlier Ys games. An enemy should be rammed from the sides in order to hurt him. If performed incorrectly, the player will get hurt himself. It's also possible to use magic and position oneself strategically in battle so that the enemy won't be able to inflict any damage.

The game is a series of set-piece battles where two opponents build up gauges using the D-pad and one of the face buttons: each combination leads to a separate attack and requires a different amount of build-up. The player can go through the story mode, which recounts events from the manga, or they can play a "free" mode against opponents of their choice.</desc>

	<name>Zen Nippon Pro Wrestling Dash:  Sekai Saikyou Tag</name>
	<desc>An updated version of Zen Nippon Pro Wrestling, Dash updates the character roster and adds minor cosmetic touches to the mix such as wrestler introductions and new character artwork. The biggest addition however is the inclusion of a 4-player royal rumble mode and the ability to perform team-up moves in the tag matches.

The game casts you as a wrestler of your choice in the official Zen Nippon Pro Wrestling league and pits you against the other featured wrestlers in grappling matches. As in the original you get to pick between several game modes including: Tournament, Championship (single or tag) Vs, Team (with the new 4-player variant) and Training.</desc>

	<name>Zero 4 Champ RR</name>
	<desc>Zero4 Champ RR is a 1994 racing video game developed by Media Rings for the Super Famicom, about an 18-year-old race car driver who must chase his dreams of drag racing after being turned down for university (and becoming a r?nin due to his joblessness status).

Because the game takes place in the "near future" and it was released in the mid-1990s, the game itself is referring the story of the game to the first decade of the 21st century.

This game received a sequel in the form of Zero4 Champ RR-Z.</desc>
