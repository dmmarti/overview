From TV Animation: Slam Dunk: Shikyou Gekitotsu!! is the first Super Famicom game in the From TV Animation: Slam Dunk series of basketball games based on the basketball manga and anime of the same name. The player has some control over each match, and must occasionally complete QTEs to intercept the ball, throw three-pointers and other offensive and defensive maneuvers. 
 
A special limited edition entitled From TV Animation: Slam Dunk: Dream Team Shueisha Limited was also released later the same year. It has identical gameplay but only includes All-Star teams.
