Bishoujo Senshi Sailor Moon S: Kondoha Puzzle de Oshiokiyo is a falling block competitive puzzle game. Players begin by choosing from a selection of Sailor Moon licensed characters, each with a unique special attack. The player is presented with a board filled with colored blocks in three colors: red, blue and green. The goal is to remove all the blocks from play. Clicking on a block that touches several adjacent blocks of the same color will remove them all from play. As each player successfully clears blocks, they drop "black blocks" on their opponent as well as increase their power bar. Black blocks cannot be removed by normal means and disappear only when large ammounts of blocks are removed adjacent to them. As the power bar charges, players can unleash their special ability, often an attack on the other player. 
 
This puzzle game is based on the "S" series of Sailor Moon and includes characters from there: Sailor Moon, Sailor Mars, Sailor Venus, Sailor Mercury, Sailor Jupiter, Chibiusa, Tuxedo Mask, Sailor Uranus, Sailor Neptune and Sailor Pluto.
