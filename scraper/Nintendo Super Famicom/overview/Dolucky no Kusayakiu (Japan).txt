Neco Dolucky is a cool cat from New York City. He enjoys soul music and dancing, and loves nothing more than a cool, refreshing Coca Cola Classic. One day he and his other animal friends were bored, so they decided to start a baseball league. One can assume their sponsor is the Coca Cola Corporation... Suddenly, they receive a challenge via telegram from the "Tab Clear Empire Hellthunder Destroyers!" Of course they can't back down, that wouldn't be TOUGH. Fight on through baseball, boys!
