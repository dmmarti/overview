Dezaemon, or Kaite Tsukutte Asoberu ("Draw, Make, Ready to Play") Dezaemon is a shoot 'em up construction kit from Athena. It allows players to draw their own ships, including additional frames of animation for moving right and left, as well as creating enemies and bosses, customizing weapon types and other elements. The game comes with a built-in "demo" project: Daioh Gale, a pseudo-sequel to Athena's 1983 Arcade game Daioh.Dezaemon is a rebuilt version of Athena's original 1991 Famicom game Game Designer Yusei Soft: Dezaemon. This version of Dezaemon would later see an enhanced PlayStation edition named Dezaemon Plus in 1996, which in 2010 became the first Dezaemon game available in the US when it was added to the US PSN store.
