The fourth addition to the Bomberman series for the SNES.  This game is almost identical to Super Bomberman 3 only with new levels and a new story.A small twist in this game is that instead of choosing the traditional bomberman or a country specific character players get to choose between bosses from the previous game when playing battle mode.  Each character has a special power from a jet pack to throwing abilities.
