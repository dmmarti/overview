The fourth installment in the popular strategy series, set in the continent of Jugdral, southeast of Akaneia. The game's first fifth chapters follow the Prince of Chalphy, Sigurd -- from there, his son Celis becomes the protagonist. The game uses the same turn-based strategy gameplay as its predecessors, but changes up the promotion system by making it entirely level-based, adds RPG-style status effects, and introduces the concept of the weapons triangle, in that a sword is strong against an axe, spear against the sword, and axe against the spear. Seisen no Keifu also featured much larger maps than previous titles (though a lower number of them -- 12 in all) and a handful of new units, such as the Troubadour, Dragon Master, and Falcon Knight. The game was released late in the Super Famicom's lifecycle in Japan and never published internationally.
