The game is based on the animé series Sailor Moon. The main character of the series is Tsukino Usagi, a 14-year-old schoolgirl who unexpectedly gets involved in an epic adventure. Luna, a magical talking cat, contacts her and tells her she is in fact a Sailor Moon, one of the legendary Pretty Fighters - girls who fight the forces of darkness and protect the Kingdom of Moon.  
 
The game is based on the events of the animé that follow the victory of Usagi and her friends over the Queen Beryl. Peace has returned to the Moon Kingdom. But suddenly, a little girl named Chibiusa arrives from the future and says the future kingdom is threatened by the forces of the evil Prince Diamond. Looks like you are the only ones who can defeat him, and save the future Sailor Moon, Chibiusa's mother. 
 
This is a beat-'em up game. You can play as either Usagi or any of her girlfriends, including Chibiusa. You move on a platform and fight the enemies by punching, kicking, and throwing them, and by using special abilities unique to each character. You can advance only after you have cleared an area from enemies.
