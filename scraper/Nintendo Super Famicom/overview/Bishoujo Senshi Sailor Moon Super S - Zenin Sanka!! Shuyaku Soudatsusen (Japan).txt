The game is based on the manga/animÃ© series Sailor Moon. It tells the story of Pretty Sailor Fighters, teenage girls who were summoned to protect the futuristic Moon Kingdom and to fight the forces of darkness, led by the evil Queen Beryl and Prince Diamond. The main heroine is a girl named Tsukino Usagi, who was contacted by the magical talking cat Luna to become Sailor Moon, the leader of the group. 
 
This fighting game is an enhanced version of Bishoujo Senshi Sailor Moon S: Jougai Ranto!? Shuyaku Soudatsusen. Girls compete against each other in tournament mode, story mode, player-vs.-computer mode, and two players mode. They can use physical attacks and magical spells. In story mode you can also upgrade your fighter's attributes (strength, defense power, etc.) New in this expanded version: additional playable characters (hence the title Zen'in Sanka - "Everyone Participates"), different scenes in story mode, additional backgrounds for battles.
