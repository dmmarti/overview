Another sports title in the Nekketsu High game series, this time featuring the Nekketsu guys go at each other's throat while playing baseball. 
 
The game features a single play, Vs and Tournament/story mode. The gameplay itself is similar to other baseball games in the sense that it subdivides the different stages of baseball (batting, pitching, running bases, etc.) in different "mini games" with their own camera angles and interfaces. 
 
As expected of a Nekketsu game you can play it rough by sneaking punches and kicks to "bend" the rules a bit, you can also use the "ki" or willpower of your players to trigger special moves and strategic management is limited to specifying different base strategies and behaviors for each player.
