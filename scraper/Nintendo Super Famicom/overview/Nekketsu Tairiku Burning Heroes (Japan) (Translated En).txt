"Burning Heroes" lets you start as either one of the four characters. Each one starts in a different place and is seemingly absorbed in his/her personal quest, but as the game progresses, the four heroes meet each other. You should also find and "unlock" four other playable characters as you advance in the game. The gameplay system of "Burning Heroes" is similar to other console-style RPGs: you fight random enemies and bosses in turn-based combat, viewed from third-person perspective, like in Final Fantasy games. As you get hit in a battle, your "passion" (literally "hot blood", nekketsu in Japanese) level rises, and the more damage you take, the quicker you reach 100%. Once the passion bar is full, you can summon a powerful monster and to unleash a devastating attack on the entire enemy party.
