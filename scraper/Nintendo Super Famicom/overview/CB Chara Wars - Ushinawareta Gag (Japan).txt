CB Chara Wars, sometimes written with the subtitle Ushinawareta Gag, is an RPG that features a crossover of sorts of Go Nagai's various manga franchises. These include Devilman and Mazinger Z, among others. The "CB" in the title refers to the term "chibi", which depicts characters as smaller and cuter than usual. In that sense, it is similar to the term SD (super deformation) found in several Super Famicokm Gundam game titles.CB Chara Wars began as an original video animation which first aired in 1991. A manga adaptation followed the following year, as did this game. Banpresto published the game in Japan, a company known for creating games with anime crossovers such as the Super Robot Taisen/Wars series.
