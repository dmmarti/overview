Action Pachio is a game featuring the Pachio-kun character in a straightforward side-scrolling platform game, rather than the usual pachinko. The game is somewhat reminiscent of Sonic the Hedgehog, as Pachio will often roll through areas at speed. 
 
Pachio-kun made several more appearances on the Super Famicom, but most of them are in his core pachinko-playing series.
