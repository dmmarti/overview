Long, long ago, in the Kefin Desert, on the Continent of Afroka, a strong wind blew throughout the night... There is nothing but desert in Kefin area, but a legend tells a city was once was there -the city of Kefin. There is a rumor a legendary treasure is hidden somewhere amidst the ruins of the city. Who will dare to explore the dangerous region and to uncover the mysteries of the past? There is one who dares - Adol, the hero of the Ys saga.
