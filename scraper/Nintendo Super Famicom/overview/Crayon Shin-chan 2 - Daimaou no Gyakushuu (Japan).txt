Crayon Shin-Chan 2: Dai Maou no Gyakushu ("Crayon Shin-Chan 2: The Demon Lord's Counterattack") is a platformer based on the Crayon Shin-Chan anime and manga. The player, as the mischievous kindergartner Shin-chan, must rescue his favorite super hero Action Kamen ("Action Mask") from his prison before Action Kamen's supervillain nemesis Haiguremaou can take over both Action Kamen's and Shin-chan's worlds. Many of the bosses are transformed versions of Shin-chan's friends and family. 
 
The game is a standard side-scrolling 2D platformer - common with licensed games - though it is notable for letting players decide which order they want to tackle stages, not to mention the franchise's penchant for weird/gross-out humor.
