Lady is a girl from a good family. So, is she a good girl? Well, not really... she doesn't care much for good manners and diligent study, but thinks only about faraway lands and treasure. Wherever she appears, destruction follows... Lady's parents, afraid of their daughter's hyperactive nature, locked her in a mansion guarded by two loyal servants: the gardener Yoshio and the cook Cocks (yes, that's the name!). One day, Lady finds a book about Deathland Island, where supposedly a great treasure is hidden. She escapes the mansion, arrives at Deathland Island, and learns its was once ruled by a mad scientist King Baron, who made experiments on monsters. Lady decides to explore Baron's castle and the rest of the island, to find a way to get to the legendary treasure."Lady Stalker" is an isometric action RPG, closely connected to the more known game  Landstalker for Sega Genesis. You explore dungeons and other locations, most of which are full of various puzzles. You can't jump, but you can dash (jumping over small pits) instead. The regular battles are random. Once you enter a battle, you control Lady in real-time, but later in the game, other characters join the party. Those characters are controlled by the AI, but you can pause the battle at any time and assign commands to them.
