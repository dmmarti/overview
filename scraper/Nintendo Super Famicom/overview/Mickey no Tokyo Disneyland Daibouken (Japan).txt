Mickey has taken a trip to Tokyo Disneyland. But when he arrives, he finds out from Minnie that his friends have been kidnapped and the park has been hijacked by none other than Pete. Armed with nothing but a combo water/helium backpack and some balloons, Mickey must trek through the different sections of the park to rescue his friends, held captive in some of the park's most iconic attractions, and stop Pete.
