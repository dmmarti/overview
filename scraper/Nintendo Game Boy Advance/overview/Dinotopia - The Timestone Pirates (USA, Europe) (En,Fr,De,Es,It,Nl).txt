Dinotopia - The Timestone Pirates is 2D platform game in "Dinotopia" (portmanteau of "dinosaur" and "utopia") universe (humans and sentient dinosaurs coexist peacefully). Main hero is Clayton, who must rescue dinosaur's eggs and find Time Stone. He uses Sunstone Prod, (a device similar to a staff with special powers, like lasers or earthquake). Game has 5 levels: Waterfall City, Treetown, Canyon City, Underwater and Diamond Caverns. Clayton fights against pirates and bosses, jumps on platforms, and (later) uses dinosaur Kreekor to ride.
