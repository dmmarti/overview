While going out for a walk one day, Popeye and Olive Oyl were harassed by Bluto once again. Sick of their bickering, Olive decides to have a a race to decide who will accompany her for a walk. Wimpy, lured with the promise of food, joins in on the action.

Popeye: Rush for Spinach is a racing game in the guise of a side-scrolling platformer. Players choose from either Popeye, Olive, Bluto or Wimpy, and then navigate their way to the finish line of each world. Special power-ups help them gain speed, such as cars, pogo sticks, skateboards, rockets and even dinosaurs. Strewn across the levels are assorted hazards designed to slow you down and make progression more difficult. In addition to the standard Adventure Mode, which strings together the levels with a story, you can also choose from a versus mode, or a time trial mode.
