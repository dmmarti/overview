In Madagascar for Nintendo DS, based on the movie of the same name, you play as Marty (zebra), Alex (lion), Gloria (hippo), and Melman (giraffe). Levels require you to switch between the available characters to make use of their special abilities.

The DS's touch-screen is used to switch characters, fight, and make some movements. Players must explore levels to find hidden collectibles, some of which are only available after unlocking abilities. The story follows the movie plot, with players exploring New York City's Central Park Zoo as well as Madagascar.
