Based on the 2003 Disney film of the same name, this game is designed with a blend of role-playing and action

Pirates of the Caribbean (GBA) takes place in a large group of Caribbean islands during the golden age of piracy and high seas adventure.

The player takes command of a ship and its crew, swordfights with other captains, accepts daring quests, and chases rumours of dangers and riches.

Action takes place using an isometric view, and is split into two gameplay styles - exploration and battle.
