The zoo animals have revolted against the zoo keeper. It is your job to restore order and "capture" all of the animals.  In this fast-paced match-up game, players select animals of the same type using either the touch-screen or a standard controller. Line like animals up in rows by swapping them from spot to spot in the time allowed. There are five varied game play modes: Normal, Tokoton, Quest, Time Attack and 2P. Normal mode has you clearing a set amount of animals each level before progressing to the next. Tokoton is similar to Normal, but has all the animal amounts set to 100 before you'll level up. Quest has you playing ten set stages with specific goals (such as only capturing animals of a certain type) that you must attempt to achieve. Time Attack has you aiming to get the highest score possible in the time limit. 2P has two players battling it out against each other.
