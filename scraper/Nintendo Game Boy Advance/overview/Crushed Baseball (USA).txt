Crushed Baseball 2004 will offer completely original fully-interactive ballparks, where a key interactive feature will reward the player with additional �Mojo� abilities if they perform a certain task.� For example, in a stadium with a stained glass window in the centerfield wall, if a player hits a ball that smashes through the window, they will be rewarded with additional �Mojo� abilities.� In the Karate Dojo stadium, decorated in the traditional Japanese style, players can hit the gong to gain more �Mojo� abilities. �� � The game offers players the ability to set the time of day, weather effects and type of turf they play on.� Players can choose to play a night game in the rain on a dirt surface, a day game in the wind on AstroTurf or real grass and more.� In addition, Crushed Baseball 2004 will be the first baseball game to offer five fully playable female players and 10 original team mascots including a ram, an eagle and a bear.�
