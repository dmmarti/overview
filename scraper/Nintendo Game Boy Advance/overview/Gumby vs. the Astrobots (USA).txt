Professor Kapp has accidentally invented a machine that can control Gumby's friends, the Astrobots.  Minutes after its creation, it naturally gets stolen by the mischievous Blockheads!  Who knows what sort of trouble they'll get up to with it!

Gumby vs. the Astrobots is a side-scrolling platform game where you play as Gumby.  Explore different books to rescue your friends, such as Pokey, Prickle and Goo, who have all been kidnapped by the Astrobots.  Gumby can use his abilities to transform into a clay ball, a minecart, a helicopter and more as he explores various different books to rescue his friends.  Throughout each world are ice-creams, Gumby's favourite treat, to collect.
