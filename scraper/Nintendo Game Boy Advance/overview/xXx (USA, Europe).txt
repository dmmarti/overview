A new breed of secret agent. 

As underground thrill-seeker Xander Cage "xXxï¿½", you have been recruited by the National Security Administration as their next super-agent. After completing two "tests" set up by Agent Gibbons, it looks like you've got what it takes to take on and take out the opposition. 

Your target: Anarchy 99 -- the deadliest crime syndicate since the mafia took over New York. They've got biological weapons and a terrorist agenda. You've got firepower and attitude to sabotage their stockpile of terrorist missiles, bombs and biochemical weaponry. 

   Race against the clock to disarm their weapons of destruction before your enemy's targets are blown sky-high! Race through 11 exciting levels in adrenaline-pumping motorcycle combat. Fight with an array of high-tech devices that are at your disposal, including dart chrome guns, electro-impulse motorcycles, and high-impact incendiary grenade launchers. 

Nobody said that being a hero was easy, X. Good thing. You wouldn't be here if it was...
