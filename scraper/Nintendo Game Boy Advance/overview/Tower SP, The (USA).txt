An enhanced port of The Tower, better known as SimTower, for the Game Boy Advance. Build your tower, set up offices and stores, and don't forget about the elevators.

The Gameboy Advance version is mostly identical to the PC/Mac version, but has a few enhancements, such as letting you manually clean bathrooms, and an extensive tutorial.
