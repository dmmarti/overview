Join the adventures of Ozzy, a white blood cell "cop," and his cold-pill sidekick, Drix. Ozzy & Drix lets you become part of the action in the cartoon series from the Kids' WB. Now you can do everything from whizzing down a blood cell highway in the Cel Camino and providing protection from the dreaded Phlegm-alanch to facing off against your nemeses, Spryman and Gluteus. The entire adventure takes place inside the body of a teenage boy.
