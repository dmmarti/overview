This game offers sidescrolling beat em up action with cat and mouse due, Tom and Jerry.  Based on the direct to video film of the same name, Jerry gets a prized magical ring stuck on his head which Tom was charged with guarding. 10 levels of enemies must be fought off to release it.

Re-create the classic slapstick of the cartoons using a multitude of household items such as bats and plates, all capable of causing damage they were not designed for.  Fight wacky boss characters, including Droopy the Dog, playing a mystic seer in his first ever videogame appearance.
