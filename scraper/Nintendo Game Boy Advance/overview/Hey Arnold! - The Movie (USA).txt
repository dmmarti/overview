This is a jump 'n run game based on the movie of Nickelodeon's popular TV show Hey Arnold. The player can play several characters from the TV series (Arnold, Gerald, Grandpa and Grandma and Helga as hidden character). It follows the story of the movie where the player has to save the neighborhood from the show. The game features five different areas (City Area, Indoor, Building, Underground and another City Area). Saving is done via passwords that save every detail of progress such as remaining lives or collected coins.
