Once again, an advanced Terminator is sent to the past to threaten John Connor's life. The player control's Arnold's iconic cyborg as he battles robots and police through the future and the present to save him. Levels loosely follow the plot of the third Terminator film.

The Game Boy Advance title is an isometric shooter with 10 single-player levels. Levels are made up of rooms with specific objectives (defend, survive, etc.) for each. The Terminator can fire a variety of projectile weapons, throw explosives, and can punch effectively when all else fails. A few levels also include vehicles to control. The Terminator can also activate the films' red-tinted Terminator vision for a limited time, to spot hidden items or areas and cause additional damage to enemies.

Two players can fight through unique co-op challenges over a link cable, where they will fight spawning enemies and bosses in progressive rooms. Up to four players can also control their own Terminator in a capture-the-flag arena mode.
