Fortress of Solitude is a puzzle game set within Superman's arctic retreat that features occasional "interruptions" by villains which turn into flying action stages where Superman must use his heat vision and ice breath to destroy enemies to collect items. Each of the puzzles is timed in addition to having a cumulative timer for all the puzzles in the level.
