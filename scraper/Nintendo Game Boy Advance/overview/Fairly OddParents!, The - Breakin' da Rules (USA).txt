Single player, action side-scroller shooter where you must retrieve the lost pages of the Da Rules book and prevent Vicky from ruling the world.

You control Timmy from the TV show and can wish for Cosmo or Wanda to aid in destruction, including a massive interstellar orbital strike screen clear.  As you wade through legions of enemies, "poof"ing them away, you'll fight deadly frogs, Yugopotamians, piranhas, and other foul beasts across more than 30 unique AIs.
