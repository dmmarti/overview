Punch King is an arcade boxing game with 18 unique fighters--the most ever in a hand-held boxing game--each with individual fighter styles and attributes, plus commentary, catch phrases and home arenas for each fighter, including individual theme music. Combo punching action delivers bone-crunching attacks. There are several game modes, including Create-A-Boxer Mode, Career Mode--win fight purses and purchase new combos and special moves to K.O. opponents--and simultaneous head-to-head multi-player link action.
