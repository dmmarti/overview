Take the role of a stablehand and take care of the horses of your guests or breed new, strong horses. Or work as a riding teacher and take care of the education of pupils and horses. Ride tournaments and become world-famous. Don’t forget your daily work besides all these tasks. The horses in your stable want to be taken care of and trained. And if you just want to have fun, take one of your horses and go for a ride at the beach, in the forest or on meadows and fields. Also run your errands in the near city by horse.
