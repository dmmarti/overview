Breaking the conventions of prior Pok�mon games, you play as a human who has suddenly been transformed into a Pok�mon, but before you could come to grips with this startling revelation, a Butterfree needs help! It's baby Caterpie has fallen into a dungeon and cannot get out!

You and other Pok�mon you befriend along the way must brave randomly created dungeons to help out other Pok�mon who find themselves in need of rescuing or  just need something delivered. Both happen. 

Unlike previous Pok�mon games, the battles take place on the map (though they are still turn based), and although you may only directly control the Pok�mon that represents you in the game, you can your companions vague battle orders. Such as: use more special attacks or conserve items.
