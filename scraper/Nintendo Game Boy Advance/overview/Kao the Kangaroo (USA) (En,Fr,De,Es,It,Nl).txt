Crikey! Kao's been stolen from down under! It's up to you to get him home to the Outback.

Unlike the Windows and Dreamcast versions of this game, the GBA version is a 2D side scrolling platform game. You control Kao the Kangaroo through twenty-seven levels. You basic modes of travel are running or jumping but in later levels, you will have snowboarding, flying and jet skiing. As you travel along, enemies try to stop you. You must kill or avoid these enemies. Your main weapon is a pair of boxing gloves with which you can pound enemies but, if you push down and attack, you can also do a tail spin to attack lower-height enemies. In each level, there are flags you can pick up and, by pressing select, you can drop them to create your own continue point.
