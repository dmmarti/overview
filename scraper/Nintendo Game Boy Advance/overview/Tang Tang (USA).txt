The Associated Nexus of Galaxies (TANG) has been threatened by hordes of invaders bent on pillaging the natural resource of Energy Crystals. As a last hope, the TANG calls upon four super dimensional cyborg heroes, the Tangibles, who have the ability to conjure up solid blocks out of thin air. These brave soldiers will use their cunning, quick reflexes and Power Bolts to retrieve the Energy Crystals and push back the advancing armada.
