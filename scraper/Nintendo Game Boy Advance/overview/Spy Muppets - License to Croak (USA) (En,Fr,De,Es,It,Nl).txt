Kermit the Frog agent of M.U.P.P.E.T. must find three villains and spoil their evil plans in this children's game.

In "story" mode, stopping each villain requires completing a series of mini arcade levels such as spy car chases or snowball battles (at a choice of three difficulty levels).  These mini-games can also be played individually in "activity" mode.

Muppet fans will enjoy the spy themed twists on familiar characters such as Gonzo the Great as "Dr. Nose" or Fozzie Bear as "Agent Triple-F" although there is no voice acting for their dialogue and the cut scenes are slideshows not animations (a limitation of GBA design).
