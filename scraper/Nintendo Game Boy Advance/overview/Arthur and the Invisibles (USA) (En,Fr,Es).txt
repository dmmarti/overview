Arthur and the Invisibles is an officially licensed game for the French film of the same name (Arthur et les Minimoys in French). Players assume the role of 10 year old Arthur. His grandmother is about to lose her house and Arthur wants to stop this. Instead of the conventional channels Arthur travels to the land of the Minimoys; minuscule creatures just a tenth of an inch tall. Here he searches for his grandfather's treasure together with princess Selenia. This treasure should save the house. But to find it they'll have to travel to the forbidden city ruled by the evil M. the Malicious.

The Minimoy world consists of the house and its garden, but in an up-scaled size, since the characters are very small. Unlike the PC and console version, which is in 3D, the Game Boy Advance version uses a sidescrolling perspective. The player gets to play as both Arthur, Selenia and her little brother Betamesh. Each character has its own abilities. Arthur is more acrobatic, Selenia has a knife with which she can cut through foliage and Betamesh is smaller and can use this advantage to creep through smaller areas. The story in the game closely follows the script of the film.
