Yggdra Union takes place in the centrally-located kingdom of Fantajinia. The princess, Yggdra Yuril Altowits, flees the castle town of Parteena as the nation's era of peace falls apart, the legendary holy sword Grand Centurio in hand. As the only remaining survivor of the royal lineage, she hopes to free her country from its invaders.

The game plays out like a turn-based strategy RPG however it also incorporates some card-based battle mechanics which sets it apart from other titles in the genre.
