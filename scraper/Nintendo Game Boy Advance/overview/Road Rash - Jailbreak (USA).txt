Road Rash: Jailbreak for the GBA features the classic Road Rash gameplay; motorcycle racing on busy streets, with dirty tricks both allowed and expected. Several game modes are included. Wild Race is a basic race, just you versus several computer bikers in a race to the finish line. Use your fists or items you find along the way to knock opponents off their bike and into the hands of law enforcement. Cop Patrol puts you into the shoes of Marshall Lee, to take down those no-good motorcycling thugs. Time Attack is pure racing; just you, the road, and a ticking clock. Survival mode doesn't allow you to restart a race if you lose, so you'll need to complete all races on the first try. Finally, a 2-player mode is included.

Three different characters are included, each with distinct strengths and a special weapon. Between races, you can upgrade your chosen character. Saving is possible through passwords, and both your current upgrades and unlocked tracks will be remembered.
