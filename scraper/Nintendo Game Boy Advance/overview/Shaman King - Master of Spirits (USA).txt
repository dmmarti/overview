In this game you play Yoh Asakura from the Shaman King Japanese Manga and TV Anime series.
Yoh is a shaman, one of the chosen few who can communicate with ghosts and spirits. When Yoh teams up with the ghost, Amidamaru, he begins his incredible quest to be crowned Shaman King in the Grand Tournament held only once every 500 years!
Use Yoh's inherent ability to control ghosts and spirits in order to defeat his enemies. You will control various spirits such as "Bason" and "Corey" that appear in the original manga, avoid endless traps, conjure spirits and master your "Shaman" skills as you battle to defeat your enemies and stop a diabolical shaman from resurrecting the evil Guardian of Demons.
