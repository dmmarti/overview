Super Duper Sumos is an action game based off the Nickelodeon's hit series of the same name. Three 18-year-old Sumo wrestlers are available: 

1. Boomer, Defender of Peace
2. Kimo, Defender of Honor, or
3. Mamoo, Defender of Truth

The three ancient heroes travel to the modern world to defend all that is good and to defeat the evil Ms. Mister and her minions at Build and Destroy Incorporated. All three can increase their size, and use their special powers to defeat their enemies. Boomer performs the Gluteus Maximus, used to squash enemies with his butt; Kimo performs The Honorable Thunderball, where he runs at full speed before rolling over his enemies; Mamoo uses his Sumo Squeeze to squeeze the life out of his enemies. Together they must use their ancient powers to save the world.
