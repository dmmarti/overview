More closely based on the events of the movie, Jurassic Park III, you play Paleontologist Alan Grant who is part of an observation of Isla Sorna. Little did he and the rest of the team know that Isla Sorna is home to 'site B', the test island for the Jurassic Park Island destroyed some years before hand. And soon enough thier place crash lands on the island.

You must now find your way through 8 levels of dinosaurs, varying in strength and speed, to a resuce boat on the other side of the island. You can either run from the many dinos in your way or pick up and use items to attack the dinos.
