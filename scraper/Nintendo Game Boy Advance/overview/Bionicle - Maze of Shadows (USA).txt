Bionicle: Maze of Shadows is a top-down action game set in the LEGO Bionicle universe and based on the book of the same name. The game features six playable characters, six stages and multiplayer features.

The Toe Metru, six great heroes, are looking for a means to awaken their sleeping people, the Matoran. They need to venture into the underground labyrinth Maze of Shadows, where the vicious Rahi lurk and filled with traps and puzzles.

The player controls all of the six Toa Metru, and he has to use their individual special skills to overcome the challenges thrown at him. During the course of the game, each Toa Metru can enhance gis special skills, each representing a different element (ice, air, earth, fire, stone, and water). While the standard gameplay takes place from a top-down view, combat is played out in turn-based fashion similar to Golden Sun.
