Pokémon FireRed takes the player into the world of Kanto on a mission to catch all of the 350 pokémon for Pokémon researcher Prof. Oak. Pokémon are animal-looking creatures that pretty much form this and all the other games in the Pokémon Universe. The challenge is to capture them all using pokéballs and an own set of these strange creatures, as well as training them for the ultimate battle, the Elite Four!

The game is a remake of the original Pokémon Red and offers the same diversity of gameplay as the original. However, this game has got everything the player might miss in the classic game: updated art and graphics, new pokémon, and perhaps the most interesting: the wireless adapter. This allows the player to trade wireless with friends within a limited radius. In addition to all of this, the player may explore a new set of islands outside of Kanto, the Sevii Islands! Enter the union room, make a dream team or explore the world of Kanto in this epic gameplay experience from the Universe of Pokémon.

Gotta catch 'em all!
