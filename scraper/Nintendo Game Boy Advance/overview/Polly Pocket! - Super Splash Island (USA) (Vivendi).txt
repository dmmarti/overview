Join Polly and her friends for a day of fun and surprises at Super Splash Island. In Polly Pocket, you can play games and go on water rides while gaining special skills. Collect power-ups and prizes to help Polly move faster, or gain skills in each race to earn tickets. Water-park activities include sliding through colored tubes, racing in bumper boats, playing minigames, and more. As you progress through each event, you'll unlock dressing rooms full of fashion surprises. Polly Pocket also features two-player modes.
