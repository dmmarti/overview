Based on a Walt Disney Presentation of a Pixar Animation Studios film, Finding Nemo: The Continuing Adventures picks up right where the movie ends. The Tank Gang have managed to escape from the dentist's office and Nemo, Dory, Marlin, Bruce, Crush and Squirt must help them get to their new homes in the ocean.
