Inspired by the hit Playhouse Disney television series on the Disney Channel, Disney's Little Einsteins for the Game Boy Advance takes children on entertaining adventures with their favorite characters from the show. There are six different types of gameplay, including steering Rocket to avoid obstacles in the air, matching pieces of music, dancing over flower buds and making art come to life. A different piece of art opens each mission. Fly over mountains and through canyons, as well as gather instruments to play music.
