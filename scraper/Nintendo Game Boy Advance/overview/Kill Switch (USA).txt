Kill.switch is the handheld version of the third-person shooter game kill.switch. It has several differences, like the number of levels (only six in this version).  The player controls a soldier who must complete missions and kill enemies and bosses, moving from area to area to engage new enemy groups. The game has a cover system that allows the player to "attach" to objects and fire at the enemies from a safe position.  Kill.switch has full 3D graphics, a rarity for a Game Boy Advance game.
