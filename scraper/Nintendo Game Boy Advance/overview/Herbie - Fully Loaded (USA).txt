In this racing game, based on the movie of the same name, the player controls Herbie, the thinking Volkswagen Bug, through several races. Included is a story mode, featuring scenes from the film before each race, a free race mode, where unlocked tracks can be replayed on different difficulty levels, and an unlockable championship mode, which goes through all races in order.

In a race, Herbie will compete against several opponents. There are powerups scattered around the track, which can make Herbie go faster, jump, and shoot a tire. Herbie likes to win, so if he's doing well, he'll go faster, but if he just got hit or is last place, he'll be sad and drive slower. His current mood is noted on the screen.
