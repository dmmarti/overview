Agent Hugo: RoboRumble is a fast paced racing game with platform elements.  The city of Aquapolis has been invaded by a new evil villain - Geekdorph, Lord of Robots. Agent Hugo escapes to a teleporter and gets beamed to the secret hideout of R.I.S.K (Risky Intelligent Spy Knights).  From the hideout, Hugo must teleport into space, the desert and Aquapolis to defeat Geekdorph's challenges and collect information about Geekdorph's secret location - so the final three stage boss-fight can take place and the citizens of Aquapolis set free.  Hugo has a companion - TEX 2000 - an intelligent hoverboard. Surf on TEX 2000. Destroy robots with his force field or shoot them with lasers, missiles and smart bombs! Accelerate TEX 2000 to extreme speeds and take risky jumps to increase your score.  The player controls Hugo standing on the hoverboard (TEX 2000) and has to help him complete three main game plays in a total of nine levels.  "Time run": Can you complete a number of rounds on time?  "Destroy all robots": Can you takeout all robots?  "Point collect": Jump high - look around! - can you make a perfect score?
