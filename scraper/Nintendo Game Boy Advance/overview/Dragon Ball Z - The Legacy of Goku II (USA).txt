Following on where Legacy of Goku left off, and expanding the story built by the cartoon series, here you play as five different characters through 3 sagas that will test your skills.

Fight your way through the Trunks, Androids and Cell sagas as Trunks, Vegeta, Piccolo, Gohan and Goku through either hand-to-hand or distant combat. Build up your character(s) experience and power as you build your way up to the ultimate battle with Cell.
