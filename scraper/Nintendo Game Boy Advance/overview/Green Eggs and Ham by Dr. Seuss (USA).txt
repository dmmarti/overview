Join Sam-I-Am as he leads you through zany Seussian worlds in search of green eggs and ham. While collecting this odd delicacy, you'll use a 3D game board to jump from adventure to adventure. You can play solo or join forces with three of your friends to play simultaneously on a single Game Boy Advance. The first-ever Dr. Seuss title available on the handheld, Dr. Seuss: Green Eggs and Ham features controls and gameplay specifically tailored for younger players.
