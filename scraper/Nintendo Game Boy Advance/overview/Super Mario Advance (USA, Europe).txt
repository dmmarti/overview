This game consists of Super Mario Bros. 2 and Mario Bros. together in one Pak.  There's all the running, jumping, and veggie-flinging from the original Super Mario Bros. 2, plus new enemies and bigger items.  In the updated arcade classic Mario Bros., you can work together or have a brawl bumping off baddies and collecting coins.
