Based on the SNES classic, Contra III: The Alien Wars, your job is to clean out 6 levels filled with aliens and humans who all wish to see you dead, and stopping the Red Falcon from taking over the world.

2 player's can play side by side in each level, upgraded from the original designs in the SNES title, as well as new levels based on those from Contra: Hard Corps (originally released on the Genesis).
