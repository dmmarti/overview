It's time for the Cartoon Network Racing Championship! Players can pick their character, and race for the finish line. Cartoon Network Speedway is a racing game with plentiful power-ups, shortcuts, and unlockables. It includes a quick race (just a simple race of 1-5 laps), challenge (beat the star rating), championship (beat all the races), and two-player mode. The twist to this game is that it's not enough to come in first, but the player also has to be stylish. The star rating is used to unlock characters, tracks, and power-ups, and is increased by passing opponents, attacking opponents, collecting stars, setting records, and so on.  Twelve tracks and characters are included, most locked at the beginning. 20 different power-ups can be found, for attacks, road hazards, speed, and odder effects.
