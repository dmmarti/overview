A unique combination of side-scrolling platform and puzzle solving genres, where you must solve the puzzles behind the DNA of many of the dinosaurs featured in the movie Jurassic Park 3, and many others featured in the rest of the Jurassic Park movie series.

You start by choosing one of two characters, a professional photographer or pilot, and find your way through more than 12 levels of side-scrolling action, dodging dino's and other dangerous hazards. Along the paths are pieces of DNA. The task for each level is to collect enough DNA to open the exit at the end, opening the second part of the game, Dinosaur Creation. 

With the DNA you have collected, you must match them together correctly to create 10 different species of dinosaur. As you reach further into the game, the harder it becomes to correctly match the DNA samples.
