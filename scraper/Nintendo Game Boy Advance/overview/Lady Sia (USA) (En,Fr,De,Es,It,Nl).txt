Lady Sia is a young female warrior princess who's attempting to save her homeland from the cruel beastmen, the T'soas. 

At the opening Sia is being thrown in prison. A veiled figure eventually helps her escape, and that's where you begin the game. Run, jump, crawl, climb, sneak and slash your way past monsters, demons, and assorted perils in order to save your empire from the evil race of the animal creatures.
