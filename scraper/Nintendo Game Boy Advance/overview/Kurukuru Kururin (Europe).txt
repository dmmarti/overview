Kuru Kuru Kururin is an innovative puzzle game in which the main character is inside a helicopter, and he must navigate himself through a maze in the least amount of time possible. Movements must be timed and precise, because if the helicopter's propeller hits a wall, 3 seconds is added to the timer. The protagonist's mission is to retrieve his brothers, who will join him after he finds them. He also finds many power-ups that will allow him to customize his helicopter's appearance.
