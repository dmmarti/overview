Some of Bubble Town's robots are running around aimlessly and acting very strange. Scientists think this may be happening because they are suffering from Solex overload. You must stop at nothing to save every Solex-crazed robot in Bubble Town before Dr. K and his bad bots find them! Join Conner and his friends at the Botties Pit to command and control some of the coolest robots in Bubble Town, including Cubix himself! Use Cubix and his robot pals to pick up and throw items, fire lasers and rockets, drop mines, throw robotic super punches, collect and use power-ups, and perform special attacks. It's an all out robot battle to the finish against Dr. K and his bad bots!
