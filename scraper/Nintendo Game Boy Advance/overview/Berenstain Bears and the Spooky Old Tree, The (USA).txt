When Brother Bear, Sister Bear, and their cousin Fred head out to explore an scary house, a thunderstorm forces them to take shelter in a spooky old tree. Now rather lost, they must puzzle their way through seven large levels to escape.  The Berenstain Bears and the Spooky Old Tree is a puzzle platform game based on the book with same name. Each of the three bears have different abilities and attacks, and all three will need to work together to reach the exit in each level. Brother Bear can push boxes, and has a slingshot that shoots straight ahead. Sister Bear can jump extra far, and has a stick. Cousin Fred can use a rope to reach high areas, and can throw pinecones in an arc. When they're attacked by enemies, they lose courage. After three attacks, they need to retry the level. Candy and honey pots are scattered around the level, and will give the Bears another chance at the level.  The game was packaged with a Berenstain Bears story, called Trick or Treat.
