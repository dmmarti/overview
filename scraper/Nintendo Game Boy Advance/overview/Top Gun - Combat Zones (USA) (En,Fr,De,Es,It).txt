With the F-14, F-18, and F-22 under your control, you must embark on dangerous low-level missions throughout hazardous canyons and across vast cityscapes. Eliminate ground or air targets in Southeast Asia, Gulf States, Arctic Circle, and Miramar Base. The game offers 36 intense missions and a replay mode that lets you review each one through different camera angles.
