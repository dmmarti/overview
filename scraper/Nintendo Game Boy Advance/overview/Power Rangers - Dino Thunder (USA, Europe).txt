The mad scientist Mesagog plans to send the world back into the age of dinosaurs, and only the Dino Thunder Power Rangers can stop him. As one of these heroes, you must stop Mesagog and his Tyrannodrones by using the Dino Zords--powerful creatures that are part dinosaur and part machine. You can switch between Zords in the middle of missions and enhance their abilities with special power-ups. Test your skills in more than 50 different missions and minigames in 10 free-roaming worlds.
