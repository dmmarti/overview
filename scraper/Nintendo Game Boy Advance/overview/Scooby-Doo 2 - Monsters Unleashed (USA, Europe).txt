Scooby-Doo 2 starts your story of Scooby and the gang at a museum where they are donating masks and costumes of every crook they have caught.  In each level, you must complete the objectives given to you as you move through this side scroller platform game.

You have the ability to jump, attack, climb, and more as you move through each level from start to finish.  Don't let your courage meter drop too low, or you will have to start over.  It acts like a life meter in other games.

Collect Scooby Snacks along the way and if you get them all, you get an extra life.  Once you complete your objectives and make it to the end of the level, a box of Scooby Snacks will appear allowing you to leave the level and move on to the next.
