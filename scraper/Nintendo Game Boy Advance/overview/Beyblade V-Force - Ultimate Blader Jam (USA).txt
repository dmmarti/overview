In a twist for the series, Beyblade VForce: Ultimate Blader Jam is not based on spinning top battles. Instead, the game bears a closer resemblance to Marble Madness. In each level, you'll need to get your top to the exit, negotiating narrow paths, and watching out for enemies. There are collectibles in each level, called Bit Beasts, and each level has a par time to beat. Of course, you're controlling a top, not a marble, and so you have a spin gauge. The lower this gauge gets, the harder your top will be to control, and the closer you are to losing. The story features a group of mysterious strangers who are systematically beating the world Beyblade champions.

This game also has a multiplayer mode. Battle against a friend in the battle mode, and try to knock your opponent's Beyblade off the level, or just stay spinning longer. There is also a race mode, which challenges you to reach the exit before your opponent.
