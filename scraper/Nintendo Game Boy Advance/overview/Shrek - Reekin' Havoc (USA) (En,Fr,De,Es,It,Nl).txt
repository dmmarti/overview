Shrek: Reekin' Havoc is a 2D beat'em up game set in the Shrek universe. The action takes place after the first movie. Lord Farquaad is dead... but his GHOST continues to makes chaos. Fiona and Shrek must stop him. The player controls Fiona and then continues as Shrek, through levels like villages or woods, while fighting against enemies. The gameplay is 2D (like in Bad Dudes or Vigilante ). Sometimes the player must jump over obstacles or holes. Bosses (such as Pinocchio and The Wolf) await the player at the end of each level.
