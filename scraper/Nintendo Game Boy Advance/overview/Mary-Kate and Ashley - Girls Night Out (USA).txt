Do you have good rhythm? Mary-Kate and Ashley have organized a girls night out filled with hip fashion and some hip-hop dance moves. First, you've got to have the right look to get into the club: select from the twins' wardrobe of clothes, shoes, and accessories. Then it's time to dance the night away. Like other popular music games, Girls Night Out will challenge you to repeat a series of key-press patterns to the game's music. Dance well and you'll unlock new dance moves, new songs, and even clothes. You can also rock the house by playing DJ for the club. The game lets you create and save your own music mixes from techno, house, and disco clips.
