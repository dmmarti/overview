X-Bladez: Inline Skater is a racing game dedicated to the inline skating extreme sport. The game allows the player to control and race skaters through 3D levels, performing tricks such as back-flips, flat spins, heel grabs, and others. Racers are able to jump over trash cans, mailboxes, and road signs. It is also possible to grab speed boosts to increase the velocity of the skateboard, as well as collect tokens scattered throughout each level to unlock secrets. Additional levels can be unlocked by gathering qualifying points, which are awarded for trying particularly daring stunts.
