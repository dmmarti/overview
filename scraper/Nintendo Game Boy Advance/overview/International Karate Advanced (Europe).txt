International Karate Advanced is a GBA remake of International Karate 2000 for the Game Boy Color with the 3-way free-for-all from IK+ rather than the standard 1-on-1 from the original IK and IK2000. It features the same 12 playable characters, but now the game tells you the skill of the character in a scale of 1 to 5 stars. The same classic bonus games from IK+ and IK2000 have returned, as well as a practice dojo, which was previously included in the Game Boy Color game
