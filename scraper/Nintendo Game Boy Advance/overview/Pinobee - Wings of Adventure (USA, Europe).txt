Grandpa Bee has kidnapped before finishing you, Pinobee - a robotic bee made to defend the world. The player must go through 9 worlds in order to find and rescue your creator. There are multiple storylines with multiple endings. Pinobee can take out most enemies by jumping on top of then, but the most important means of attack is a dash, which can be executed in any direction (also diagonal). The amount of consecutive dashes can be upgraded when meeting a certain character. Pinobee collects flower and question mark bubbles provide power-ups, enhancing the dashes, providing temporary shields or other bonuses. Players can use the Game Link to collect and trade items with friends for power-ups.
