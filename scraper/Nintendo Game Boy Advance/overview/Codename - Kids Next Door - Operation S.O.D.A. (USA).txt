With the recent unanimous passing of the Soda Control Act through the Completely Unbiased We Don't Like Kids Adult Senate, the drinking age of soda has been raised to 13 years and older. The Kids Next Door have refused to recognize this dastardly attempt at keeping their favorite beverage from children and have taken it upon themselves to run a bootlegging operation providing soda to any kid, worldwide, who wants it with NO QUESTIONS ASKED. Mr. Fizz, the kids hating head of the Soda Control Board, has vowed to stop these illegal operations at all costs. Join the Kids Next Door in an exciting mission, as they fight for kid's soda-drinking rights everywhere!
