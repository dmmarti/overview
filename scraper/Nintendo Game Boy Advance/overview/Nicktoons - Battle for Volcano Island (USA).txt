On Volcano Island, a couple of crabs, led by the Wise Crab, are enacting a ritual to send 9 heroes there to save their island • But the Mawgu, an evil being, brings the ritual to a halt, scattering the heroes. Danny Phantom and SpongeBob SquarePants fall from the sky and end up with the Wise Old Crab, • and he explains why they were dropped here: The Mawgu was an ancient enemy who escaped his prison, and seeks vengeance, using a toxic ooze which corrupts everything it touches, but the prophecies say that "The Chosen Ones" will save them. • The Crab trains them and tells the heroes to follow him so that he can direct them to camp. The heroes stop various enemies, and then find Patrick. They then go Shipwreck Cliff and rescue Tucker from repeatedly regurgitating giant seagulls
