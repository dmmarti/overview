In this second version since the series restart, you are attempting to take out Gaul, the Ape King.  The GBA version of the game is a side scrolling, platforming, fighting game with a intuitive yet deep combo attack system.  You will be fighting your way across multiple locations and solving various puzzles to reach and defeat the various bosses along the way.  Use breath weapons, fury mode, and many basic melee and air attacks together to form a variety of ways to defeat your enemies.
