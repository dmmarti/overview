Big Mutha Truckers puts you behind the wheel of big rigs, for big-country truck racing! Ma Jackson, owner of Big Mutha Truckers, Inc., has announced to her four kids that she is calling it quits. To decide which of her four kids will inherit the business, she gives them a "Trial by Truckin'." Whoever makes the most money trucking through Hick State County in 60 days will take control of the company. Players can choose to play Bobbie-Sue, Cletus, Earl, and Rawkus and get behind the wheel in a fully customizable rig. Drive through five distinct cities, hauing every kind of cargo - from cellular phones to oil.
