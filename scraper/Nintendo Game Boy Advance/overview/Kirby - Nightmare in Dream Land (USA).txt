When King Dedede steals the Star Rod, it's up to Kirby to recover the fragmented pieces from Triple D's underlings and restore power to the Fountain of Dreams. Kirby: Nightmare in Dream Land is an action-packed side-scrolling adventure chock full of awesome copy abilities and fast-moving gameplay. Kirby may not look tough, but he can float over dangerous obstacles, eat enemy projectiles, and copy his enemies' abilities. You can use these skills in the single-player story mode or multiplayer mode with up to three friends using the Game Boy Advance Link cable.
