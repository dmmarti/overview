Bundle of Rayman Advance and Rayman 3.

In Rayman Advance, the lead character consists of a body, a head, two hands and two feet - no arms or legs. Humorous action-adventure/platformer in which the player must jump and climb, and defeat enemies. 

In Rayman 3 the lead character has learned some new abilities. His friend Globox has eaten the Lord of the Dark Lums, thereby enraging the Hoodlums.
