Disney's Tarzan: Return to the Jungle finds Tarzan on quests that vary from locating the Fountain of Youth to discovering The Lost Valley of the Dinosaurs. Besides being able to swing from vines, swim through treacherous waters and engage in tree-surfing action, Tarzan will now be able to wield his trusty boomerang, mighty spear and famous animal call to protect his friends and jungle home. Along the way, Tarzan's friends, Jane, Terk and Professor Porter will join him on his jungle adventures. Disney's Tarzan: Return to the Jungle is being developed by Digital Eclipse, the developer responsible for the Game Boy Color original.
