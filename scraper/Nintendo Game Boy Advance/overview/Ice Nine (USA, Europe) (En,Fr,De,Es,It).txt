Set at the secret CIA training facility called the Farm at Camp Peary in Virginia, a young agent trainee named James Clayton (Colin Farrell) is failed during his training, then recruited by his ex-trainer Burke (Al Pacino) to take part in a secret undercover operation designed to thwart the theft of a destructive program known as 'ICE NINE.' The player, as a covert operative for the CIA, performs missions handed down by a high-ranking CIA member. The missions take the player through a conspiracy plot that leads right to the top!  The Recruit takes place in first person mode, so the player works their way through missions seeing what the game character sees, i.e. only their hand and the weapon they're currently holding. The player shoots enemies, plants microphones, knocks people out, and snipes enemies from on high. Mission briefings are supplied at the beginning of each mission, and occasionally updated mid-mission if the scenario has changed.
