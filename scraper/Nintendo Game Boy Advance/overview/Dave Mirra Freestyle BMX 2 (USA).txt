Dave Mirra returns along with 14 pro riders including Ryan Nyquist, Mike Laird and Collin Mackay. 8 levels are on offer, with a total of 1,500 tricks to master. You can create your own BMX park thanks to the Park Editor mode. And while you attempt to master the tricks, you can listen to the soundtrack featuring Ozzy Osbourne, The Cult, Methods of Mayhem, Godsmack and Rage Against the Machine (all except Game Boy Advance version).
