The rally racing series comes to the GBA with texture mapped 3d graphics that take the GBA in a direction never thought possible.
Players can choose from a variety of game modes including rally racing, circuit racing and time trials or link up and go head to head with another player. The better and further you get the more cars and tracks are unlocked.
View the race from inside the car or behind it as you scream through snow, rain, fog, dirt, gravel and over jumps at different times of day and night as you try to become the best rally racer on the planet.
Features battery backup.
