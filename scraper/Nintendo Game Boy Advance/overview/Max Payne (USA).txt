Max Payne lost his family to death. Now he's out for revenge. In the tradition of the original PC hit, Max Payne on Game Boy Advance follows the story of Max has he attempts to bring down the crime lords who attempted to destroy his life.

Unlike the original, the GBA version uses an isometric perspective to present the action, however everything else is included, right down to bullet time. Various weapons are on offer to dispatch the guys (or gals) standing in your way, and by using bullet time, you can slow down time and increase your chances of both avoiding incoming fire and hitting the target.
