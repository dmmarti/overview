Similar to Gadget Racers, your goal is to complete multiple challenges to open to tracks and challenges in order to win the game.

Finish in the top 3 in each challenge and win money to upgrade your car.  There are over 100 upgrades available such as new engines, tires, steering wheels, shifters... even new car bodies and paint.

The game consists of 150 challenges on 60 different tracks.  These come in the form of standard racing, drag racing, stopping on time within an area, jumping onto "bullseyes", running circles around a cone, and more.  You'll never be bored from doing the same thing on the same track.

Enjoy tracks that are paved, sand, and snow.  Also, enjoy racing in the rain where traction is poor.  With the right upgrades to your car, you can handle these dangers.  Without them, you may not finish in the top 3.

In order to progress in the challenges, you need to finish in the top 3 in each race.  If you finish first, you not only get more money, but you also get a prize.  Prizes are free parts for your car.  This can save you money and can allow you to get certain upgrades more quickly as not all upgrades are available from the start.

Besides the normal challenges, there are also sprint races and battle races to choose from.  Play all these races in single player, or linked with up to 3 other players.  Or, connect to the GameCube with Road Trip: Arcade to unlock more content.

The game tracks all your parts that you have acquired, completed races, race results, and more.
