In the near future, a team of scientists discover alien technology embedded inside meteors, which leads them to conclude that Earth will be invaded by aliens! You must command your very own giant robot (dubbed "Personal Troopers") with rockets, swords, guns or lasers throughout multiple missions and two different storylines!

The game follows in the tradition of the previous Super Robot Taisen games: You must control an army of huge robots to defend and attack against an enemy invasion. You can do this by air, sea and land. Every mission contains several requirements you must fulfill in order to proceed to the next stage - you must order your mechs to move, attack or defend depending on the situation at hand, all while experiencing the battle through cutscenes which show the fight just as it happens.
