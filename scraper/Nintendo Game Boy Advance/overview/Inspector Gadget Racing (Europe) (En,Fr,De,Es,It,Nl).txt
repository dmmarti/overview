Based on the animated cartoon by DIC (Super Mario Bros. Super Show, all three Sonic cartoons, The Real Ghostbusters) of the same name, Inspector Gadget Racing is a racing game developed by Bit Managers that is similar to games like the Mario Kart series, Vivid Image's Street Racer and other kart racing games for the SNES and Game Boy Advance. Selectable characters include Inspector Gadget (with both the Gadget Van and Gadget Mobile), Penny/Sophie (in a 4X4 truck), Brain (in an ice cream truck), Chief Quimby (in a police car), Dr. Claw, Agent Abdul (in a truck) and Agent Bruce.

The characters have their own power ups, for example Penny/Sophie has a shield, Gadget has his Gadget Mallet and Agent Bruce has an oil slick Spy Hunter-style. They can still pick up other power-ups, like missiles, bubblegum (to slow down an opponent), a shield and others. The game also has land-based courses, air-based courses and underwater-based courses

The game has multiple languages, like LSP's other Inspector Gadget game for the Game Boy Advance, Inspector Gadget: Advance Mission (English, Spanish, German, French, Italian and Dutch)
