All aboard the Polar Express!  Take a journey to the North Pole as you visit scenes from the movie based on the book by Chris Van Allsburg.  Play as the brave Hero Boy as he has a trip filled with adventure on the magical train.

Players make their way through The Polar Express' carriages, furnaces and even North Pole City as they make their way to meet Santa Claus himself.  Special toys will grant the Hero Boy powers, like the Pogo Stick, the Balloon, and the Magic Wand - although you might be unlucky and find a pair of socks!  You'll even get to drive the train itself!
