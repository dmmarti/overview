Again it is Christmas but Christmas is in danger. A disgruntled witch has accursed all toys and now all the children hide from the vicious toys. Santa Claus will not be able to find all the children just in time. He needs help. Young Nick is the one who will help Santa Claus. His job is to find the hidden boys and girls and to deliver their presents. By doing this he has to avoid all the belligerent toys.

Santa Claus Jr. Advance is a classical platformer. Nick has to avoid snowball throwing Yeti's, bouncing basketballs, wild mountain goats, hitting mechanical shovel excavator and many more. Climbing on chains, jumping away from avalanches... and so on.
