The third title in the F-Zero series is more like the SNES original then the N64 sequel in terms of presentation. Fly around 20 detailed futuristic tracks with many vehicles to choose from. 4 players can play a simple track with the same vehicle using one cart and 4 Game Boy Advances, or play a more detailed 4 player mode with 4 cartridges and GBA's.
