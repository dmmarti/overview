Best Friends – My Horse gives you the unique opportunity to raise a foal in your own stable. You will choose between 15 different horse characters and then gradually assemble all tools and a lot of know-how as a basis for your success. Depending on how well you have done in training and grooming, your horse will give astounding performances both in showcase jumping and beauty competitions. Keep track of the growing trust and friendship in your secret diary! Outside the stable a landscape waits for you to be explored on horseback.
