LEGO Soccer Mania isn't a normal football game: you can customise your own Lego team, using standard players, cowboys, pirates, and Martians. Use your skill and creativity to challenge the equally crazy opposition to hilarious matches. There are 10 unique, action-packed, themed stadium environments, and the opportunity to adventure across mystery islands, snowy valleys, medieval castles, pirate ships, cowboy forts, and even into space. Supports 2 players with a Link Cable.
