The Clone-a-Matic is the answer to all of Dexter's problems. With it, he can duplicate himself as many times as he wants, finally giving him enough time to do everything that needs doing. It is also covered in flashing lights, and unlocked. One press of a button later, and more than a hundred miniature Dee-Dees swarm over Dexter's laboratory.

Deesaster Strikes is an isometric platformer. Explore your laboratory, return the miniature clones to the Clone-a-Matic for recombination, and repair the damage caused by your sister. Be careful, though. Your formerly helpful robots are now bent on your destruction, and there are more environmental hazards than you remember.
