Once there, Extreme Ghostbusters Kylie or Eduardo have to search throughout 3 different levels in each area until they find both their needed clue, and defeat the Boss Ghost in the area.  Once back at headquarters, Dr. Egon Spengler will give Kylie and Eduardo direction as to what their next assignment will be.
