Board Game Classics includes the games Chess, Checkers, and Backgammon. In each of these games, you can either face the computer, on one of three difficulty levels, play against your friends, watch the computer play itself, or set up a tournament against the computer. You can choose an avatar, piece set, and board as well.

Optional variant rules include forcing jumps in checkers, castling and en passant in chess, and backgammon scoring and automatic doubling in backgammon.
