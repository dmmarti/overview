Frogger's home, Firefly Swamp, is in great danger.  The nefarious Mr. D has stolen the 4 elements, water, fire, wind, and air.  Without these, Firefly Swamp will die.  

Frogger must travel through 15 levels within 5 worlds to retrieve the elements. Once he has the elements, Frogger can enter the Temple of the Frog and put the kibosh on Mr. D.
