The Gameboy Advance sequel to Spyro: Season of Ice sees Spyro the dragon once again journeying through multiple worlds, this time in search of fireflies (which give dragons their fiery breath) which have been stolen by the Rhinocs.

All the old favourite characters are there, with Hunter and Bianca, and the player can also control Sheila the Kangaroo and Agent 9 (who is a mildly psychotic monkey).

Spyro has a few unusual abilities in this GBA game, including a fire/ice breath toggle - some items can only be affected by one or the other.

Unlike the PSX games, Spyro is presented primarily in an isometric view.
