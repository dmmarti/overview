Dora the Explorer is a very young Latina who speaks English peppered with Spanish words. She stars in an animated children's television series that premiered in the US in 1999.  In Dora the Explorer: World Adventure it's coming up to World Friendship day and Swiper has mistakenly taken Friendship bracelets from all over the world! Dora needs Swiper's help and the player's to search the world (well really just France, Tanzania, Russia, and China but the game is for the very young), find the bracelets, and save the day. The game follows the format of other Dora the Explorer games. As the player completes a puzzle or task a sticker or a postcard is placed in their book, this marks progress and encourages the player to continue.  This is an edutainment game which, the packaging claims, can help children learn about:
 World Geography, Countries and Cultures 
Different Languages 
 Motor Skills 
 Matching, Sorting, & Patterning 
Colours and Shapes 
Problem Solving 
Visual Identification Skills The Value of Friendship 
Plus a little Spanish too!
