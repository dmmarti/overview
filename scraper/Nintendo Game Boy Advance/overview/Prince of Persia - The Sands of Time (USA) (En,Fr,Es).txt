Based on the console series of the same name, the Prince of Persia has been tricked into unleashing the Sands of Time, a power that can control time and space. With the Kingdom turned upside down, the Prince must right this wrong and save all, using the Sands of TIme itself to his advantage.

Unlike the console versions, this GBA title reverts back to the tried and true platform adventuring of the original Prince of Persia, with added elements of action and puzzle solving. Players can use the power of the Dagger of Time to reverse time if a mistake is made during play, and you will also control a second character during play to open switches for the Prince to proceed.
