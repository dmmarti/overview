The story of Babar is the story of a charming and charismatic elephant whose greatest joy in life is his family. Throughout his adventures, whenever he is faced with challenges, Babar always finds the strength to rise above difficulty and search out the silver lining of every cloud. Babar in the Wilderness aims to stimulate children's imagination and their ability to find solutions while exercising hand-to-eye coordination and helping them learn the greatest lesson of all: despite life's challenges, great things are possible if one never gets discouraged! So One beautiful day in Celesteville, Babar's two sons, Pom, Alexander and his cousin Arthur are playing hide and seek with the monkey Zephir. In the courtyard of the castle, two huge hot air balloons are tied to the ground and Pom and Alexander decide to use one of them as a hiding place. Suddenly the rope holding the balloon is accidentally loosened and the balloon slowly rises up, high into the sky, drifting away with the wind. When Babar finds out, he quickly gets in the second hot air balloon and flies off into the wilderness to rescue his two sons.
