4 classic Sega arcade titles return on one GBA cartridge:

Outrun has you racing to the finish line, with multiple paths to race through, different conditions, plus plenty of traffic to dodge past. You can also choose from a range of background musical tracks with the radio.

Space Harrier has you flying and blasting your way through level after level of aliens, dodging incoming fire and other obstacles in your way.

Super Hang On, the second racer in the compilation, is a motoGP style racer where turbo boosts come into play. Beat the clock and the opposing racers while keeping yoru bike on the track to avoid falling off.

Finally, there's the flight sim action title, After Burner, which has you flying over land and sea, dogfighting with enemy craft.
