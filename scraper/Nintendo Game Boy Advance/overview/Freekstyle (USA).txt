Freekstyle for Game Boy Advance is the ultimate motocross challenge. It's not about being the fastest, it's about being fearless. Battle against the world's newest aerial daredevils out of the turns, through the hoops and in the air--and when it's all over storm back to the top of the hill and do it all over again.
