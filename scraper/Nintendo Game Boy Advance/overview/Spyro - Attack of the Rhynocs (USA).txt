One of the Professor's inventions has inadvertently torn a large hole in the fabric of space/time, creating a portal between the Rhynoc Lands and the Dragon Realms. Ripto, naturally, is taking full advantage of this, as he starts sending his armies of rhynocs through the portal to wreak havoc. Spyro must find somehow find a way to close the portal before Ripto succeeds in taking over the Dragon Realms.

This is Spyro's third outing on the Game Boy Advance. Features include new RPG-like elements, new upgradable breath abilities, and three playable characters (Spyro, Agent 9 the Space Monkey, and Sgt. Byrd). Bonus multiplayer Sgt.Byrd levels can also be unlocked.
