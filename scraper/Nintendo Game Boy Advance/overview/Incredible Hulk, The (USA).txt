Based on the long running comic book series (and not the 2003 film, The Hulk) you must control the green giant through 33 levels of intense action in which multiple enemies will attack you at once, walls can be bashed through to get to other areas, and anything that gets in your way can either be destroyed or used as a weapon.

Also included is a 4 player mode in which each player takes control of a different coloured Hulk in an all-on-all brawl.
