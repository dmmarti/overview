Gekido Advance: Kintaro's Revenge is a 2D beat 'em up game, a continuation of Gekido. The main hero is Tetsuo from the previous game - he returned to his sensei's house and now must liberate the village from demons. Game isn't a standard beat'em up - has nonlinear levels, not just "go-right". Often Tetsuo must first find key to doors, or talk to the right people. Rest is simple - he fights against various demons, he can kick, punch and use special magic. Sometimes Tetsuo jumps on narrow platforms. Game has 2D graphic and anime-style cut scenes.
