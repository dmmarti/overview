Unlike Batman: Rise of Sin Tzu on console platforms, the GBA version is a 2D platformer/beat'em up. The player controls Batman, one of the main heroes from DC Comics universe. Batman runs through various Gotham districts, jumps on roofs, and fights against criminals; our hero can use his fists, gadgets, or heavy objects that he may chance upon to incapacitate his foes. While running there will be many platformer obstacles like needing to to interact with levers to move to following areas. The main villain in story is Sin Tzu, but Batman meets other villains from the universe, such as the Scarecrow.  Using a Gamecube to Game Boy Advance link cable unlockables can be obtained in both the console and handheld versions of this game.
