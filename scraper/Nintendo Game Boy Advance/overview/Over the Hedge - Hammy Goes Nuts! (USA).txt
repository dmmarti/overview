This sequel to the Over the Hedge games is different from the Nintendo DS and Sony PSP versions since this is a mini-golf game. Levels consist of either traditional sink-the-ball mini-golf holes or levels with objects that must be broken by the ball. Hammy the squirrel must run around levels to move objects so that the path to the hole is clear, while other movie characters actually hit the ball. Players must complete each hole at or under par in order to unlock Challenge Mode, which consists of harder levels.

The game also consists of a single cartridge multiplayer mode where players pass the GBA to up to 3 other players to compete against each other.
