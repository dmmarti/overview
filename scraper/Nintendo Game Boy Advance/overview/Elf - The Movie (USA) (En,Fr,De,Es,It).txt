This platformer is based on the hit 2003 movie starring Will Ferrell who played a boy who was raised by elves in the North Pole and became a large elf comparatively. At 30 years of age, Buddy goes on a journey to New York to find his real father and a place where he can fit in.  The game's release was timed to come out the following 2004 holiday season with the dvd release and contains the choice of 5 languages.  

The main game is a side-scroller where you guide Buddy as he makes his way across icebergs while avoiding chasms and polar bears, dodges Manhattan traffic, and more. There are 10 missions based on the movie's events as he journeys to also help Santa and save Christmas.  You must collect missing sleigh parts, letters (to spell "New York" in one level) or parcels.  You will be penalized falling into the icy water or getting hit by a car which drains your health. To restore it, you   jump for lollipops and candies, Buddy's favorite foods. There are also 3 mini-games available from the start menu: Snowman Building is like Sokoban, Santa Says is a memorization game, and Cobbler's Workshop has you matching elves' shoes to put them in boxes. Plus, more minigames are available within the game.
