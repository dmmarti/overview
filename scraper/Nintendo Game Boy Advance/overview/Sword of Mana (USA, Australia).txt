Sword of Mana tells the tale of two unlikely companions, a former prisoner out for revenge and the last known girl from the Mana tribe. The two come together, despite their differences, for one very important reason: they are the only ones that can save the Mana tree.

Based upon the Mana series and the classic Game Boy title Final Fantasy Adventures, you can take control of both characters (or join with another player in co-op) and battle in realtime using spells, weapons and many more items.
