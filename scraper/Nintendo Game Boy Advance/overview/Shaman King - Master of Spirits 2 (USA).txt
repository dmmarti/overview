Sequel to the original Shaman King: Master of Spirits, you once again take the role of Yoh Asakura as you attempt to save all your friends and fellow shamans from Zeke's Fire Spirit, who is devouring the soul of everyone in Dobie Village, where the Shaman Tournament is to take place.

It's up to you to figure out a way to save your friends and foes, and defeat Zeke before he steals the title of Shaman King from your hands!
