The wedding anniversary for Penny Proud's parents is close, and that means its time to get them a present!  Penny made something herself, but her friends said that she should get them a T.H.A.N.G.(or Total Home Automated Necessity Gizmo) instead.  It's very expensive, but much cheaper if you buy it in pieces and self-assemble it.  So Penny needs to spend time working jobs to get enough money to buy it.

The video game for The Proud Family can best be described as a side-scrolling adventure game.  Players navigate through Penny's neighborhood, being informed of odd jobs that Penny can take to earn money.  Anything from picking up litter to working at the local Pizza Parlor, to finding neighbors' lost dogs on the streets.  Once Penny has earned enough money for a T.H.A.N.G. part, she can go to the store to buy it, and then the next chapter begins.

The game also has mini-games which are based around Penny's official 'jobs' that she receives.  For example, she works for her dad at his factory, combining various snacks to please three different judges.  Another mini-game has Penny competing in a dance-off.  And at Chez Wizard, she has to take up a waitress job, where she greets and seats customers, takes their orders, delivers their food, takes the payment, and clears the dirty dishes.  On top of this, it all has to be done quickly to satisfy the customers!

Certain areas in the game also present themselves as photo opportunities.  If Penny stands close enough to a star marker and presses the R Button, she'll get a photo of one of the characters from the show that will be stored in her photo album.  If she's not close enough, she'll just get a fuzzy photo of a UFO instead.
