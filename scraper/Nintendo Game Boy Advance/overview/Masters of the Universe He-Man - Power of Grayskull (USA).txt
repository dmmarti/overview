Based off the updated cartoon of the popular '80's toy, Masters of the Universe - He-Man: Power of Greyskull puts players in the role of He-Man as he hacks and slashes through a 13-level quest to confront the evil Skeletor.

Taking a nod to such classic beat-em ups like Golden Axe or Gauntlet, He-Man makes his way through the various areas of Eternia fighting hordes of Skeletor's underlings while searching for keys to open doors, power-ups to enhance strength and defense, and He-Man's captured friends, such as Man-At-Arms or Cringer.  He-Man can stop the enemies from advancing upon him by destroying the warp portals that are scattered throughout the area.

Along the way, He-Man can even ride on Battle Cat through "shooter" style levels to get to new areas and face Skeletor's main minions, such as Beast Man and Clawful.

Masters of the Universe - He-Man: Power of Greyskull uses a password save to mark player's progress throughout the game.
