Based on the events of Episode IV-VI, players take control of Luke's journey to become a Jedi as he rescues Princess Leia, trains with Yoda on Dagobah, and faces Darth Vader for the final showdown.

The game is presented in a side-scrolling format, visiting all of the planets from the series, as well as engaging in a run against the Death Star and a speeder bike chase through the forest of Endor.  As Luke progresses, he goes from a simple farmboy to a full-fledged Jedi Knight, learning new Force techniques until he is ready to face Darth Vader and Emperor Palpatine aboard the second Death Star.

Also included in the game is a multi-player mode where friends can link up against each other to engage in dogfights and mini-games with ships from the Trilogy.
