Medabots AX: Rokusho Ver. is a 2D fighting game, featuring platformer-like arenas. Players control a single Medabot and engage in 2x2 team battles wagering robot parts, which can be collected and assembled on player's Medabots. The first main objective of Medabots AX is to win a championship and, later, defeat the Rubberobo Gang.  The game features a variety of arenas and opponents which will require the player to shuffle strategies from time to time, be it changing robot parts or battle style. Medaforce is available to every Medabot, but each one has an effect based from its medal. Medals can be trained to increase damage done with close attacks and ranged attacks, or to increase efficiency from support and defense.  Medabots AX was only released in North America and is based on another game released only in Japan, Medarot G. Characters and robots were changed to fit the market. Two versions exist: Metabee and Rokusho. Even though the story is pretty similar between the games, some robot parts and medals are exclusive to a game. Battling and Trading using a Link Cable is possible and is the only way to collect every robot part and medal.
