Creatures is a very innovative game. You start with 6 eggs of "Norns". Norns are cute little creatures who live in the Creatures world. Your task is to give them knowledge about the world they live in, learn them how to speak, how to use toys, an elevator, how to eat etc. They grow older, reproduce themselves and die. The world is very huge, and the simulation of the AI is terrific.
