Superman is once again in the thick of things as agents from the planet Apokolips arrive on Earth to bring him down. Meanwhile, Lois Lane has been kidnapped by Kalibak and Livewire has fought her way out of prison. It's going to be a long day.

Played from an isometric prespective, Superman can fly his way around each level, with plenty of opportuties to use his range of powers such as heat vision and iceblast, or simply punch and kick enemies to the ground.
