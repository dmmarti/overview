Minigames can be played once you unlock them apart from the 1st one that is available from the start.

1. Minigame 1: It�s a tetris-like game where you must do horizontal and vertical rows of 3 or more of the same item.

4. Minigame 2: There is a 4x4 board with �coins� that depict a character in each side. These must be turned over in order to make matching rows of 3 or 4. There is also a timer that counts down and if you don�t manage to make a row before it does its game over.

5. Minigame 3: You are under the sea and you try to collect the items that appear on the upper right corner of the screen while avoiding the jelly fish and before the timer ends.
