The player controls Nautila, a "babelfish" which is used to indirectly influence the environment within a huge water tank. Nautila has to suck up dangerous fish, clear rocks, supply food etc. for brine shrimps resembling the Sea Monkeys brand. The Sea Monkeys try to reach a Venus Shell as soon as they are hatched. If Nautila is not fast enough to clear the puzzles preventing the Sea Monkeys from reaching their shell, they will perish...
