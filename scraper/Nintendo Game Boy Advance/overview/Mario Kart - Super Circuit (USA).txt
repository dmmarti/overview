This GBA conversion brings together elements of both Super Mario Kart (the original SNES classic) and the N64 sequel, Mario Kart 64.

Much like the SNES title, you can collect coins lying on the tracks to boost the speed of your kart.

All of the characters from MK64 are included (Mario, Luigi, Toad, Donkey Kong, Bowser, Wario, Peach, and Yoshi)

No Kart game is complete without a multiplayer mode. In this case, four can play classic and battle modes using either one cartridge and four GBA's or four cartridges and four GBA's for the full list of characters to choose from.

Weapons include the classic green and red shells and the purple spiked shell.

20 new tracks, using elements from both past titles.
