Pulled into an alternate dimension, the X-Men soon discover that their larger then life rival, Apocalypse, rules the planet. And the only way to get home is to fight your way through the many enemies under his rule to the Warp Gate.

Thankfully, you have 4 X-Men to work with (Wolverine, Cyclops, Storm and Rogue) and more characters are available to use, but only when you unlock them during play.

You can also take on 3 friends in the Versus modes, including Capture the Flag and Deathmatch options.
