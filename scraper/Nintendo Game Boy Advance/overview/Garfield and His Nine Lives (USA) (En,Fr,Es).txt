After having eaten very heavily just before going to bed, Garfield finds himself trapped in a nightmare from which he must escape and where he lives through all of his nine "lives".  The game is a conservative sidescrolling platformer, which is divided into 9 levels. Each level represents one of Garfield's lives (though this implies Garfield has lived an entire life in the sewer and another in a tree...). To get out of level, Garfield must fulfil a goal which is given at the beginning, like finding 10 eggs or getting the key to a door. After three levels, there is always a boss fight. Apart from jumping, Garfield can kick to get rid of his foes, and he can perform a ramming attack and an elbow blow.
