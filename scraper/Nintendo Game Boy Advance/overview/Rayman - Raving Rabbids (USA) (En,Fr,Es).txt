While taking a nap one fine day, Rayman was ambushed by a horde of mischievous, mad Rabbids!  Secretly plotting over the years, they have at last unleashed their armies, ready to take over the world!  They've captured Rayman and all of his friends, stolen Rayman's fists, and scattered the precious Lums far and wide!  Guess who has to save the day once again?

Unlike the console version of Rayman Raving Rabbids, the Game Boy Advance version of the game sticks to its classic side scrolling platformer roots, like the original Rayman.  Rayman can jump, glide with his hair for short distances, hurl his fists or throw a charged punch, pick up and hurl explosive barrels and other items, and even grapple onto special purple Lums, using them to swing.

New to Rayman Raving Rabbids is Rayman's ability to gain special powers by changing into different costumes based on musical styles, such as hip-hop, punk, pop and rock.  Each costume gives Rayman a specific ability which allows him to reach areas he previously couldn't and defeat enemies.
