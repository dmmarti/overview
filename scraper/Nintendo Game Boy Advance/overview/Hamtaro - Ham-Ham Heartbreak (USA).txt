Hamtaro and his friends are back for another installment of the ever-so-popular Hamtaro craze. This time, Spat threatens to cause trouble for our protagonists, and it's up to Hamtaro to stop him before it's too late! Is a potential heartbreak for Hamtaro and Bijou imminent?!?

This version plays much like the first installment, a psuedo action/adventure/graphic-and-text adventure. Again, with 86 Ham-chat words to collect, some old faves such as the greeting "Hamha!" and some new ones like "GoGo" (Go). 

Hamtaro: Ham Ham Heartbreak is based on the anime Tottoko Hamtaro, original concept by Ritsuko Kawai.
