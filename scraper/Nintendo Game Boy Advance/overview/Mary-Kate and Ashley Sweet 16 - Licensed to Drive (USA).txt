The Olsen twins are turning 16 and they're celebrating with this collection of party games and, you guessed it, driving lessons. The good news is that if you can help them get past the obstacles and pass the test, they'll take you out with their new driver's licenses to a variety of fun mini-game activities, like rock climbing, riding Jet Skis, surfing, ATV quad racing and shopping for clothes. Earn points in the party games and spend them to upgrade the car and unlock cool tunes and cooler outfits.
