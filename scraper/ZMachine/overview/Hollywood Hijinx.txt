Hollywood Hijinx is an interactive fiction computer game written by Dave Anderson and Liz Cyr-Jones and published by Infocom in 1986. The game was released for the Apple II, Atari 8-bit family, Atari ST, Amstrad CPC, Amstrad PCW, Commodore 64, Amiga, TI-99/4A, and MS-DOS. It was Infocom's twenty-third game.

As the favorite among all of actor-director Buddy Burbank and Hildegarde Montague's nephews and nieces, the player's character stands to inherit the entirety of the Burbank estate, including their palatial home Hildebud, if the player can find the ten treasures (props from Buddy's films) that crafty Aunt Hildegarde has hidden on the grounds, that is. It all has to be done in the space of one night.

Hildebud is filled with props, posters, and other memorabilia from Buddy's numerous films: a model of Tokyo with Atomic Chihuahua, the Maltese Finch, and a statue of "Buck Palace, the Fighting Mailman" (star of such films as Postage Due and Special Delivery). There are hidden passages, a convoluted hedge maze, and other bizarre features of the estate. Strange noises sound like someone else is in the house.
