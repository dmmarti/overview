 Theron's Quest is a part of the Dungeon Master series for the PC Engine/TurboGrafx.****It differs from the PC releases of Dungeon Master in a few aspects. The most important differences are:****1. You always play as Theron and can hire three additional champions.**2. Instead of a single big dungeon there are seven smaller ones, that you each have to traverse in order to find seven special items.**3. You can only save in-between dungeons, and your three companions lose all their skills and items after completing each dungeon. Theron also loses his items, but not his skills.****Due to only being able to save between dungeons and the loss of skills after each one the game has also been made easier than its PC equivalents.**Apart from that, it's a classic Dungeon Master title.
