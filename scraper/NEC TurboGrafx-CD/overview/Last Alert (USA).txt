 In the near future, a cabal of 4 very evil, powerful men known as The Force is planning world domination through the use of a Super Weapon known and Indra. You are Guy Kazama, a general-purpose bad-ass soldier who can stop these guys. You must take out each of the conspirators one by one and destroy the Indra before it becomes fully operational.  Last Alert is a shoot-em up played from a top-down perspective. You move Guy around more than 20 levels and shoot everything that stands in your way.
