 Super Air Zonk: Rockabilly Paradise is the sequel to Air Zonk where once again the player takes control of the titular character in a battle against his arch nemesis, the evil SandroVitch.  The gameplay is similar to the first, a 2-D side scrolling shooter where the player advances throughout the stage, destroying enemies and collecting power-ups to make it to the end of the stage and advance to the next. The standard huge bosses are still present along with the cartoonish-style of graphics that was present in its predecessor.  Zonk can also transform in nine different super-powered alter egos by collecting a meat icon. They include Sushi Zonk (who hurls sushi at opponents), Mini Air-Zonk, Mr. Heli Zonk, Elvis Zonk and even Gamera Zonk. He can also morph into other forms with powers and more weaponry by combining with friends that are scattered throughout the stage.
