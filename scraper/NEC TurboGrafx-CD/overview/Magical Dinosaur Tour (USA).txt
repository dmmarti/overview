 The Magical Dinosaur Tour is an extensive dinosaur database.  Several modes may be accessed from the main menu, most of which lead to visual presentations and descriptions of various dinosaurs. Individual dinosaur data can be accessed by viewing geological periods and geographical areas (e.g. China of the Cretaceous period) and selecting dinosaurs appearing on the screen; browsing a dinosaur list alphabetically; viewing a genealogical tree; and finally viewing dinosaurs by phylum and family.  Most areas can be scrolled to the sides and some of the dinosaurs present themselves with voice-overs. There is also a variety section that allows viewing various dinosaur-related records and specifications (such as the tallest dinosaurs, inhabitants of cold areas, etc.). Another section is dedicated to animated sequences depicting various locations and dinosaurs.
