 The first and only Madden game to appear on the TurboGrafx, it features the standard game modes such as exhibition and season and features full-motion video of plays, fans and many other important events happening on and off the field.  It also features digitized voices of the quarterbacks, referees and fans, but the most important being the games namesake, John Madden, who lends his voice talent to the game.
