 4 in 1 Super CD is a four-game compilation developed by Hudson and Turbo Technologies, Hudson and NEC's US distributor for the TurboDuo and its Super CD games. It was included with the TurboDuo as a bundle. The compilation contains: **Bonk's Adventure (Hudson, 1989) **Bomberman (Hudson, 1990) **Bonk's Revenge (Hudson, 1991) **Gate of Thunder (RED Entertainment/Hudson, 1992)  Despite appearing to contain only three games, Bomberman can be accessed by pressing Up, Right, Down, Left, II at the game select menu.  Bonk's Adventure, Bomberman and Bonk's Revenge had seen prior US releases, though not in the CD format. Gate of Thunder had been a Japanese exclusive until this release and, until it was added to the US Wii Virtual Console in October 2007, the 4 in 1 Super CD was the only means of playing the game in the US without importing a Japanese copy.
