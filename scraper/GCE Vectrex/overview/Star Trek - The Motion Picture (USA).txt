Star Trek: The Motion Picture is a first-person shooter set in the Star Trek universe. The player controls a ship equipped with photon torpedoes, trying to eliminate as many enemy ships as possible. After destroying a sufficient amount of enemies, the player advances to the next level.The screen has two status bars, one for the amount of torpedoes left, and one for the remaining shield. The shield is used to repel the star-shaped projectiles fired by enemy ships. Both bars can be replenished by docking with the space station that comes into view from time to time. It is also possible to warp into a black hole, where the player has to take on a Klingon mothership.
