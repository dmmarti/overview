Bedlam is a multi-directional shooter. The player controls a cannon in the center of the screen that can rotate 360°. Around the player is a star-shaped geometric form that changes from stage to stage. The corners of the star emit enemy ships that must be destroyed. The ships have different attack patterns, from ones that just travel in a straight line towards to ones which are indestructible and can only be pushed away from the player. If one of the enemy ships makes contact with the player, they will lose a life.Besides the fire button, the player can use a quick turn to better defend against opponents coming in from the other side and a "zap," which destroys all ships on screen. Later levels feature stars with corners slowly moving towards the player (and thus with enemies spawning much closer) and rotating star shapes.
