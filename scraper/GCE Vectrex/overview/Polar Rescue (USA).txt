Polar Rescue is an action game played from a first person point of view. You are the commander of a submarine on a rescue mission beneath the ice of the north pole. On each level your goal is to locate and rescue the survivors of an expedition. The waters you need to explore are quite dangerous; in addition to large chunks of ice and maelstroms, you will also need to deal with enemy submarines and numerous underwater mines. Your sub is equipped with a limited number of torpedoes to help you destroy obstacles and enemies in your way. Of course, to make the game more challenging your sub has a limited amount of oxygen. More oxygen can be collected by destroying enemy subs, but if you run out you lose one of your subs. The game ends when all of your subs have been destroyed.
