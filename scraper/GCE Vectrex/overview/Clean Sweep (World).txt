Clean Sweep is an arcade action game similar to Pac-Man. Robbers have just blown up your bank scattering the money around the now maze like passages. You control a vacuum cleaner trying to recollect all of the money! Wandering about the maze trying to catch you are the bank robbers. If they do manage to catch you, you will lose one of your lives. Each corner of the screen contains a room where your vacuum can become supercharged. While supercharged, you can destroy the bank robbers. You can only become supercharged four times, so use this sparingly. As you collect the money, your vacuum slowly becomes full. When your vacuum no longer has room to collect money, you will need to return to the vault in the center of the room to deposit the money before continuing on. When you have collected all of the money, you will move on to the next level. A second game variation is available where the maze walls are invisible making it more difficult to navigate.
