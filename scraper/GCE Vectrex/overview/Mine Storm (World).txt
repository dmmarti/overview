An alien force is laying mines through out the intergalactic lanes of travel! You are going to destroy those mines before they can harm innocents. You will be pitted against the following mines: Floating Mines: Simple mines that drift through space in the hope of colliding with ships. Fireball Mines: Not Surprisingly these hurl fire, which can be avoided or dispersed with a shot from your ship Magnetic Mines: These have a nasty tendency of following ships. Magnetic-Fireball Mines: These both follow and shoot at you! The game itself plays much like Classic Asteroids
