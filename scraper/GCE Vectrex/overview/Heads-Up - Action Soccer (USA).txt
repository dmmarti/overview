Heads Up Action Soccer is a football game played in a slightly tilted side view perspective for one or two players. The game offers three difficulty grades. To win the game, the player has to get the ball into the opponents goal as often as possible within a certain time frame, while avoiding getting any balls into their own goal.Depending on whether the player's team has the ball, the control buttons change their functions. In offense, one button is used to pass/dribble while the other shoots the ball. When defending, one button can be used to cycle through currently available teammates. It is also possible to tackle the opponent currently having the ball in an attempt to separate them from it. The goalie is controlled by holding one button, and pushing the joystick up or down to slide the goalie along a vertical line in front of the goal.Due to the Vectrex only being able to display one colour, the two teams can only be discerned by their line brightness. When playing alone, the human player controls the brighter team. In a multiplayer match, player two controls the darker team.
