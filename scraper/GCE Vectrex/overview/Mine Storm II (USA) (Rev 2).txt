Minestorm II Gameplay is similar to the arcade game Asteroids. The player moves around the screen shooting at star-shaped Mines of various sizes that have various mannerisms. All the dots on a screen can potentially turn into Mines; once a Mine is shot, two dots on the screen will turn into medium-sized Mines, which will then turn into two small Mines when shot (note: for the most part; sometimes, perhaps due to a glitch, a medium-sized Mine will just hatch one small Mine). When all dots have been turned into Mines on a screen, the Minelayer will come out, laying Mines in its wake until the player destroys it.Making contact with anything will destroy the player's ship and the game will end once there are no more reserve ships left. The Escape function acts as Hyperspace, which moves the player's ship to a random area on the screen.
