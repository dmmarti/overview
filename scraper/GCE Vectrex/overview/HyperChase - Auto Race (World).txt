Hyperchase is an action racing game similar to Pole Position. The game is played with a 3D point of view from behind your car. Your goal is to race through the course in the shortest amount of time possible; in the easier game variation, you are allowed an unlimited number of crashes, and in the harder game you are allowed only 5 crashes or the game ends. In addition to staying on the varied course roads, you will also need to avoid numerous other cars as a crash will cost you precious time. Your score in the game is based on how quickly you can complete the course.
