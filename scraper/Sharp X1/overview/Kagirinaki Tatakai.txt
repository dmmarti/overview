Kagirinaki Tatakai is a vertically structured platform shooter. The player controls a character whose goal is to descend as deep as possible into a complex underground system. The protagonist is equipped with a jetpack (which allows him to hover in the air for a while), a laser gun with unlimited ammunition, as well as limited supplies of rockets and grenades. Rockets can be shot straight ahead, while grenades can be thrown down in curved trajectories. Various types of enemies, both stationary and moving, will try to stop the hero by shooting at him. The player character takes no damage from either physical contact with an enemy or falling.  The game's stand-out feature are destructible environments. Rockets and grenades can be used to destroy any part of the scenery, be it floors, platforms, or walls. The player character, however, cannot leave the screen horizontally; walking through a whole in the wall on either side makes him appear on the opposite one. Destroying solid structures can be used to bypass maze passages or gain a better angle for shooting.
