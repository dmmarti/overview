Grobda (グロブダー, Gurobudā) is a multi-directional shooter game that was released by Namco on November 1, 1984. It runs on Namco Super Pac-Man hardware but with a video system like that used in Mappy and The Tower of Druaga, and it also uses a DAC for the "Get Ready" speech sample at the start of each round. It is a spin-off from Xevious, as the player's tank (which is the eponymous "Grobda") first appeared in that game as an enemy.</Notes
