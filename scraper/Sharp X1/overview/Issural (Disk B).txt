Legend says that the god Issural has imbued the magical stone Calvan with his powers. Two countries are ready to fight each other in order to possess the precious stone. However, it is ultimately up to a group of unknown adventurers to find it and perhaps put an end to the struggle.

Issural: The Story of Calvan is a medieval-themed fantasy role-playing game. Basic gameplay mechanics follow the Dragon Quest template, with overhead exploration, random enemy encounters, and turn-based combat. The game resembles the first Final Fantasy in requiring the player to create a party of four characters out of several available races and classes. Points can be distributed to increase the characters' attributes initially. Battles take place on separate top-down screens and feature the possibility to position characters before engaging in combat. There is a day and night cycle in the game.
