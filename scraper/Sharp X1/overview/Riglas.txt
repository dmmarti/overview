The continent of Riglas is inhabited by two races: Miria and Galt. For years they have been fighting each other for dominance. Caught in the struggle between the two is the nearly forgotten Osborn race, discriminated and enslaved. Mei is a young man belonging to that races, who leaves his home village in order to free his people.  Riglas is an action role-playing game. The game is set in a vast seamless world that consists of interconnected yet varied urban, wilderness, and dungeon-like locations. The principal view is third-person with a side-scrolling flavor, similar to Western adventure games of the time. The player is free to explore most of the locations from the onset.  The game world is populated by many different types of friendly and hostile characters. Killing hostile characters increases the player's score and eventually makes the main character stronger. Killing friendly NPCs, on the other hand, may lower the score. Combat system is simple and involves approaching a character and pressing the attack button, which results in the protagonist swinging the sword.
