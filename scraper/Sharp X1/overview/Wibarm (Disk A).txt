Wibarm is an action game with RPG elements, and several gameplay modes. The player controls a robot who can also transform into a tank or a flying spacecraft; each form has its own strengths and weaknesses. Similarly to Thexder, the player guides the transformable robot through side-scrolling levels, shooting at enemies and trying to stay alive. However, when the robot enters a building, the game transforms into one of the earlier examples of a 3D, third-person perspective shooter. The levels culminate in boss battles, which take place on separate top-down areas.  The player is given a considerable freedom as to which locations to visit first. Collecting power units increases the robot's power. If a particular boss encounter proves to be too difficult, the player can explore other areas, level up, and return to the boss stronger than before, giving the game an RPG angle.
