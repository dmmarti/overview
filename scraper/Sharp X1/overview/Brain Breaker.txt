Based on the code-breaking game Mastermind, Brain Breaker challenges the player to break a randomly created code.  The code is made up of four colored balls (of different or same color). The player is given eight guesses to solve the code, by placing four colored balls in the order the player believes may be correct. If the guess is incorrect Brain Breaker will give feedback in the form of gold and silver balls. For each of the player's guess balls that are the correct color and the correct position, the player will be given a gold feedback ball. For each guess ball that is the correct color, but the wrong position, the player will receive a silver feedback ball. If a guess ball is not of the correct color, the player will receive no feedback for that ball.
