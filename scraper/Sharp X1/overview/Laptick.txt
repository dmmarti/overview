Laptick is an action puzzle game. You play as Vickey and the goal is to step on all the question mark tiles in a stage while avoiding enemies. If you step on a blinking question mark tile you'll get either a points bonus, movement speed or jumping ability increase, 1up or turn into Super Vickey. In this form the player becomes invulnerable for a short time and can take out enemies, although they will respawn in a while. The game features 100 stages.
