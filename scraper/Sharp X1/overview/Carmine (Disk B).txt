A first-person adventure game with RPG elements, released by Microcabin in 1987. The game featured environments rendered in 3D polygon graphics, for possibly the first time in a home video game, along with early survival horror elements. However, the game is better remembered for its cyberpunk narrative, which was adapted into a sci-fi novel shortly afterwards.</Notes
