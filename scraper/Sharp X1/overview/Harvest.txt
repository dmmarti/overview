Harvest is a suspenseful mystery adventure game. This first game by the independent developer Michael B. Clark delves into the subconscious and paranormal.    You are walking your dog in the park one night when he suddenly dashes off after something and disappears from sight. Searching for him, you find the entrance to an underground complex. Knowing your dog has gone into it, you follow and find yourself inside a huge bunker-like residence. Curiosity, plus the desire to find your pet, leads you further in. You uncover a madman's plan involving a water extraction machine and the poisoning of the population's water supply. The life of a once normal person was irrevocably changed with the death of his parents. What pushed him over the edge .. and where is your dog?
