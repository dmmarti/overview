Dark Storm is the third and final game in the Demon Crystal series, unlike the first two, it's an action role-playing game. The gameplay alternates between a side-scrolling perspective (when traveling the land) and a top-down view (when in a random battle, dungeon, or shop). The combat system involves "bumping into enemies". There's also a magic system, with more spells becoming available as you level up. Moving from one location to another reduces life, so you need to find/buy food items or stay at inns to recover health. The game can be played single player, as either Ares or princess Chris, or 2 players simultaneously.</Notes
