EGGY is an action game that won the Excellence Award at Bothtec's first programming contest and was inspired by Choplifter. In this game players take the role of Ena, a robot which has to collect goods that are dropped from the sky with parachutes.  The robot has a limited fuel supply that decreases with time and every time the robot takes damage from the enemies. The fuel supply can be replenished by saving humans that were transformed into killer cyborgs.  The robot can only shoot diagonally after jumping and the location of the enemies, as well as the goods are indicated on a small map in the bottom.  To complete each level, players need to collect a set amount of goods indicated at the top-right part of the screen.
