Millipede is a 1982 arcade game by Atari, Inc. and is the sequel to the arcade hit, Centipede, with more gameplay variety and a wider array of insects than the original. The objective is to score as many points as possible by destroying all segments of the millipede as it moves toward the bottom of the screen, as well as destroying and avoiding other enemies. The game is played with a trackball and a single fire button, which can be held down for rapid-fire.</Notes
