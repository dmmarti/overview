Madness and the Minotaur is a text adventure game for the TRS-80 Color Computer. Developed by Thomas Rosenbaum of Spectral Associates in 1981, the game lulls players into a false sense of security by providing a comparatively easy and static early game. Once the player walks down the stairs, however, the game rapidly degenerates into what may have been the most difficult text adventure labyrinth ever created.</Notes
