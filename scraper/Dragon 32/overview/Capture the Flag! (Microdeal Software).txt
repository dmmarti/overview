Capture the Flag is a 3D first-person perspective, two player, video game, released for the Atari 8-bit family and VIC-20 by Sirius Software in 1983. It was written by Paul Allen Edelstein as the follow-up to his 1983 game, Wayout, which featured similar maze-based gameplay for one player. Along with its predecessor, Capture the Flag was among the first 3D maze games to offer the player full 360 degree movement, and one of the earliest multiplayer games from a first-person perspective within a 3D rendered environment.</Notes
