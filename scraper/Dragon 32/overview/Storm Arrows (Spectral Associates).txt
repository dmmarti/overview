Storm Arrows is a variant of the arcade game Targ. The game takes place in grid-like network of streets where the player drives a land skimmer. The player is pursued by a group of seven imperial storm arrows who attempt to crash into the player. To complete a level all of the storm arrows have to be destroyed. Additionally there are imperial pursuit cruisers that lay contact mines on the street. If not destroyed these mines will turn into new storm arrows when there is only one storm arrow left on the screen. The skimmer is equipped with a limited number of torpedoes and when running out it is necessary to get new ones from refuelling stations that appear randomly on the screen.</Notes
