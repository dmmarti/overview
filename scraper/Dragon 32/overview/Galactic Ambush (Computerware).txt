Your fleet of four ships are on a peaceful mission when attacked by an enemy squadron. Using your ships one at a time you must destroy the enemy. Attackers that get by your defenses rejoin the squadron to attack again!! Once you destroy all the enemy ships, another wave appear. Ships shot down whilst attacking are worth 3 times the normal value.</Notes
