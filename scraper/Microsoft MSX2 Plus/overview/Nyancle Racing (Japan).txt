Nyancle Racing is a top-down racing game from Japan. The gameplay is reminiscent of the 1983 classic Bump 'N' Jump. The player controls a vehicle shaped like a mechanic animal on a track filled with obstacles, collectable rolling pieces of candy (the game currency) and other enemy racers. The main objective is to arrive at the end before the timer runs out. The competition tries to delay progress by bumping into the vehicle to steer it off the road. The racers can take flight by passing over some squares scattered throughout the course. Pit-stops (presented as a house with a red sign painted on the roof and a "IN" sign painted on the track) are positioned at regular intervals beside the main track. Once inside them, a screen comes up with a choice of two shops where the candy can be spent:    ? The one on the left is the Unusual Items Shop, that sells a variety of power-ups: extra lives, boosts for speed/jump/steering and extra time.    ? The one on the right is the Relief Hospital, where the player can assess the damage and repair the vehicle.
