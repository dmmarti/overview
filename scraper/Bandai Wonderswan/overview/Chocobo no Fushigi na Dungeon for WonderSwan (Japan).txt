This is the first game in the Chocobo's Dungeon series.  You take on the character of Chocobo and adventure through a randomly created dungeon. 
 
The story evolves from the opening movie when a fellow chocobo is "turned" evil by a crystal he finds in a garden. When the evil chocobo kicks you into a dungeon, the adventure begins. Travel through an ever changing dungeon, collecting items and weapons to become more powerful, so you can defeat the increasingly difficult enemies.
