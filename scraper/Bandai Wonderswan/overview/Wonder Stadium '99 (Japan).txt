Wonder Stadium '99 was released a mere five months after the original Wonder Stadium and does not add much in the way of gameplay. This update adds information about the 1999 Japanese baseball season to the game. Such as Seibu's Matsuzaka and Uehara of the Yomiuri Giants. 
 
The game gives you a selection of 14 fictional and professional teams as well as three different stadiums, just as the original did.
