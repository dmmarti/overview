In this game you take play as the "Spiral Curse" of Uzumaki trying to bring curling madness to all of Kurôzu-Cho! Kirie Goshima returns but no longer as a beloved protagonist. Now she is a target, one of many, that you will try to infect with the spiral curse. In this oddly comic twist on the old horror story, not to say that this game is devoid of similar horrific elements of its predecessor. 
 
After a brief explanation of your role as the Spiral Curse, given by Uzumaki Sen'nin (The Spiral Master) you begin your task. Generally you make life worse as merry mischief making curse. 
 
You will be presented with a map of Kurôzu-Cho; from which you can select where to travel. At each locations you will meet different people and be able to collect unique items. Items can be used to make the influence of the Spiral grow in certain areas, along with interacting with various people.  
 
As you cause more mayhem more areas being to open, which allow you torment the old heroes even more! 
 
A small human/slug monster hybrid virtual pet can be accessed from the main menu.
