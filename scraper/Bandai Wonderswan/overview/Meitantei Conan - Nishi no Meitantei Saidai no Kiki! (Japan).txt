Detective Conan returns to the WonderSwans continuing his efforts to thwart the dreaded Black Organization. The game features new mysteries and new characters from the Conan universe.  
 
New features include finding keys. Keys represent actual bits of evidence you can use to solve the logic puzzles in the game once you find all the keys you will be able to attempt to solve the puzzle. However, often in the search for keys one finds hints. Hints are bits of information that will point you in the right direction of a key. Hints also be presented, singularly or combined, to various people in an attempt to extract information, or keys. Once you have all the keys you will be able to have an entire logic grid, otherwise there will be grayed out areas on the grid. 
 
There is also now a mode in some cases where Conan will have to chase the suspect through several areas before subduing him.  
 
The game records your information at the start of the game to work a character based off of you into the game. This character can be swapped with other owners of  
Meitantei Conan: Nishi no Meitantei Saidai no Kiki !? through the Communication Cable. 
 
This game alternates between horizontal display for regular play and investigation, and vertical display for Conan's detective notebook.
