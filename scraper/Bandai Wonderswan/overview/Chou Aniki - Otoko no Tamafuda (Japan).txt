Cho Aniki makes it's first appearance in a handheld console with Cho Aniki: Otoko no Tamafuda, only this time the game isn't a 2D shooter developed by Masaya, but instead a card-fighting RPG. 
 
You select your character from a roster of Cho Aniki characters and set out to explore it's funky body-building universe and challenge the many npcs for a few rounds of card combat. Win and you get to increase your collection. Special cards can be unlocked by defeating another player in the vs. mode.
