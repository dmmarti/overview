Gunpey is a puzzle game set in the wild west. Your goal is to connect pieces of fuses to get one long fuse going across the board, making it explode and disappear. There are several game modes in Gunpey, such as the classical puzzle game modes "Endless mode", where you can either play until you mess up or timed, either for 2 or 5 minutes. "Stage mode", where you have to clear a certain amount of tiles before advancing to the next stage. "Puzzle mode", where you have a set amount of fuse pieces and you need to make them all go away in one explosion. And finally "Vs. mode", where you can face off against a friend.
