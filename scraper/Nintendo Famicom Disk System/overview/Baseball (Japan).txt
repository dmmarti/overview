A baseball simulator, Exciting Baseball follows Exciting Billiards and Exciting Basket (better known as Double Dribble in the West) in Konami's series of sports games for the Famicom Disk System. 
 
Like the others in the Exciting series it's a straightforward exemplar of its particular sport. It doesn't have the flair of the original two Exciting games, as it never had an Arcade antecedent.
