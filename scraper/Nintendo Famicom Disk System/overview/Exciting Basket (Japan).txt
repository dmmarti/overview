Exciting Basket (Known in the US as Double Dribble) was a basketball arcade game developed and released in 1987 by Konami. Much of the game's popularity came from its animation sequences showing basketball players performing slam dunks.Players can choose from one of four teams: Boston, Chicago, Los Angeles and New York. There is no difference in skill level or abilities between the teams. Since there is no NBA license, no team names or player names are used, however, the teams wear the same color of their NBA counterparts (Boston wears green, Chicago red, etc.).
