Santa Claus no Takarabako (Lit. Santa Claus' treasure chest) is a Christmas themed party game. There are two modes to play: creating a Christmas card and or playing a few party games with friends. While you can play with it by yourself, it was not particular designed for that.    The four games are Poker Dice, Roulette, Slot Machine, and Bingo.
