Adian no Tsue ("Staff of Adian") is an educational action-adventure game in which you control a boy named Lucian who sets out to rescue Princess Patricia from a demon King. You must navigate levels by defeating enemies with your staff as well as solving arithmetic problems in order to earn bells and experience. Bells are the currency you'll use to buy items from the shopkeeper and 600 experience points are required in order to open the door to the next level or trigger the boss battle in specific rooms you'll need to discover.
