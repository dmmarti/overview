SG/ZH School Girl/Zombie Hunter is a shooting video game PlayStation 4 exclusive. The game has been released in Japan on 12 January 2017 and it is not been scheduled yet for western territories. It has been described as a "Zombie Panic shooting Action" ("ゾンビパニック・シューティングアクション") and it is considered within the Onechanbara popular videogames series: the setting is, in fact, the same universe. However, differently from the Onechanbara's games, the game is set in a private institute attacked by zombies while five young girls students have to fight for their survival.
