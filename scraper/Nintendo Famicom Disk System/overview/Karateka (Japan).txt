Karateka is a 1984 martial arts action game by Jordan Mechner, and was his first published game, created while attending Yale University. It was originally programmed for the Apple II, then widely ported. The game was published in North America by Br√∏derbund, and in Europe by Ariolasoft. Along with Swashbuckler (1982), Karate Champ (1984) and Yie-Ar Kung Fu (1985), Karateka was one of the earliest fighting games.
