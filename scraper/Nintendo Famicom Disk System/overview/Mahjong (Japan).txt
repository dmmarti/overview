Mahjong is a classic Chinese game available in many different variations.Being a Japanese game, Mahjong for the Nintendo Famicom unsurprisinglyrevolves around the Japanese version of the game, also known as "Reach Mahjong".While originally a game for 4 players, Nintendo for some reason turned it into a two-player game when they released it for their console. This obviously has it's effect on the rules.
