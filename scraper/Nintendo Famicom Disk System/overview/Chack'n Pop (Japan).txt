Chack'n Pop (ちゃっくんぽっぷ, Chakkunpoppu) is an arcade game released by Taito in 1983, it is considered to be the spiritual predecessor of Bubble Bobble due to the shared characters and similar game structure. The arcade rom set also contains unused graphics for the mechanical wind-up "Zen-Chan" that later appeared in Bubble Bobble. Although now considered obscure, home conversions of the game exist for Sega SG-1000, MSX, Famicom, NEC PC-6001 and NEC PC-8801, and the arcade emulation is included in Taito Legends Power-Up for the PSP and Taito Legends 2 for the Xbox, PlayStation 2, and PC.
