A sheriff must take down the outlaws of the wild west, and uncover the greater mysterious that has terrorized the town for decades. You'll scroll across stages and must defeat a certain amount of outlaws to draw out their leader and finish him off in a 3rd person shootout. Ammo is very valuable and limited in this game and must be used wisely.
