Winter Games is a sports game developed by Epyx based on sports featured in the Winter Olympic Games. A snow-and-ice themed follow-up to the highly successful Summer Games.    The game was presented as a virtual multi-sport carnival called the "Epyx Winter Games" (there was no official IOC licensing in place) with up to 2 players each choosing a country to represent, and then taking turns competing in various events to try for a medal.
