Power Soccer, also known as Power Challenge and PS, was a massively multiplayer online browser-based sports game, developed by the Swedish developer Power Challenge, the same company that develops ManagerZone (but PS focuses in the sports gameplay instead of management simulation). This game was a browser-based soccer simulator in which users could create a team and play against other users from all around the globe. Additional benefits were offered to those that purchased the Club Membership.
