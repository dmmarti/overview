Pac-Land (パックランド, Pakku-Rando) is an entry in the Pac-Man series of arcade video games, released into arcades by Namco, and its American distributor Bally Midway (later Midway Games), in August 1984. It was the first Namco arcade game to use the then-new arcade system later titled as Namco Pac-Land. Pac-Land features parallax scrolling for some of the background elements, a feature that would not become commonplace until the 16-bit console era began much later.
