Doraemon (ドラえもん, lit. "Doraemon") is a 1986 video game software developed and published by Hudson Soft for the Family Computer exclusively in Japan. It is based on Fujiko F. Fujio's (the pen name of Hiroshi Fujimoto) Japanese manga series of the same name, which later became an anime series and Asian franchise. It was the tenth best selling Famicom game released in 1986, selling approximately 1,150,000 copies in its lifetime. It is the third game created for the Doraemon license after the versions created for the Arcadia 2001 and the Epoch Cassette Vision. Even though the game is completely playable by a player with no knowledge of Japanese, ROM translator Neokid and Sky Yoshi released an English translation patch for the game but both are completely different.
