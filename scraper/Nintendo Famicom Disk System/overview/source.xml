	<desc>Transylvania enjoyed a century of peace thanks to the legendary hero, Christopher Belmont, a vampire hunter who vanquished Count Dracula one hundred years earlier with a holy whip named Vampire Killer. While the Easter celebration carried on with a grand carnival, evil men gathered in a monastery at the edge of the village and conducted a black mass to resurrect Count Dracula.

The men succeeded in bringing their master back. A bolt of lightning enveloped the monastery where they held the rite, signaling the resurrection of Count Dracula. When the Count returned, his Castle, which had fallen one hundred years prior, reappeared in Transylvania, and his legions of loyal minions reformed.

Simon Belmont, the descendant of Christopher Belmont, knew that as a member of the Belmont Clan and the current wielder of the Vampire Killer whip, it was his duty to bring peace and stability back to Transylvania by destroying Dracula.</desc>

Mario fans will appreciate the familiar look and feel of the game, while finding that its updated game play creates an entirely new challenge. No longer content just to wear different-colored overalls, Mario and Luigi also possess different skill sets (Mario can stop quicker, while Luigi can jump higher). In addition to the classic enemies already known to fans worldwide, there are also Poison Mushrooms, backward Warp Zones, and the occasional wind gust (which can help or hinder your progress) to take into account. And if that?s somehow not enough, expert players can go looking for the game?s secret worlds. So get ready to put your Mario skills to the ultimate test, and save the Princess again. Just don?t be surprised if she?s in another castle!</desc>

	<path>./TwinBee (Japan) (Disk Writer).zip</path>
	<desc>TwinBee is a vertical shoot-em-up heavily influenced by Namco's Xevious. As in Namco's classic, the ship can fire forward with a button, and drop bombs (using their tiny arms) on the ground with another. TwinBee's main distinctive features are the cute fantasy setting, where most of the enemies consist of fruit, and the two player mode. This nowadays common feature must have been one of the elements of its big success at times - Gradius and R-Type were both strictly single player experiences, and most of its competition still relied on letting the two players take turns. Twinbee and Winbee can also interact in several ways: they can unite (by holding hands) to shoot a powerful fire bullet. Perhaps more fun and effective, one ship can push the other to produce a spread bullet shot. Also, instead of getting killed outright by enemy bullets, your TwinBees will lose their limbs. When they're fully incapicitated, a little ambulance comes out from the screen, ready to resuscitate them - if you can make it. This emphasis on teamwork was undoubtedly why the title of the game is "TwinBee."</desc>

As in Namco's classic, the ship can fire forward with a button, and drop bombs (using their tiny arms) on the ground with another. TwinBee's main distinctive features are the cute fantasy setting, where most of the enemies consist of fruit, and the two player mode. This nowadays common feature must have been one of the elements of its big success at times - Gradius and R-Type were both strictly single player experiences, and most of its competition still relied on letting the two players take turns. Twinbee and Winbee can also interact in several ways: they can unite (by holding hands) to shoot a powerful fire bullet. Perhaps more fun and effective, one ship can push the other to produce a spread bullet shot. Also, instead of getting killed outright by enemy bullets, your TwinBees will lose their limbs. When they're fully incapicitated, a little ambulance comes out from the screen, ready to resuscitate them - if you can make it. This emphasis on teamwork was undoubtedly why the title of the game is "TwinBee."</desc>

While the Easter celebration carried on with a grand carnival, evil men gathered in a monastery at the edge of the village and conducted a black mass to resurrect Count Dracula.

The men succeeded in bringing their master back. A bolt of lightning enveloped the monastery where they held the rite, signaling the resurrection of Count Dracula. When the Count returned, his Castle, which had fallen one hundred years prior, reappeared in Transylvania, and his legions of loyal minions reformed.

Simon Belmont, the descendant of Christopher Belmont, knew that as a member of the Belmont Clan and the current wielder of the Vampire Killer whip, it was his duty to bring peace and stability back to Transylvania by destroying Dracula.</desc>

The invaders attack humanity's colony on Pluto and conquer it with little resistance, since human civilization doesn't have the technology to defend itself.

The human organization responsible for the space program, the "United Space Force", decides to use the yet-untested "Hyperzone Drive" in order to send ships that will directly attack the armies of the invading aliens.
