Holy Diver (Japanese: ホーリー・ダイヴァー, Hepburn: Hōrī Daivā) is a platforming video game software developed and published by Irem on April 28, 1989 for the Famicom (Japanese version of the Nintendo Entertainment System). The game was scheduled for a North American release in the same year, and even received a brief write-up in Electronic Gaming Monthly. However, possibly for licensing reasons or the game's extensive religious imagery, the game was never released outside Japan .
