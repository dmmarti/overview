rose against him. 
 
All were defeated. 
 
But a lone warrior still stands..." 
 
You play the role of a samurai that must destroy the forces of Soron. You find, however, that you cannot defeat him alone, so you must find a light mage who will aid you on your quest, and most importantly, the sacred weapon known as the Samurai Sword.
