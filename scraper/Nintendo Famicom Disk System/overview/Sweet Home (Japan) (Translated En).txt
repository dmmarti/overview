Sweet Home is a 1989 survival horror role-playing video game developed and published by Capcom for the Family Computer. It is based on the Japanese horror film of the same name, and was supervised by the film's director, Kiyoshi Kurosawa. The game was released exclusively in Japan and was not localized to other regions due to its use of brutally horrific imagery. The game was directed by Tokuro Fujiwara, who later went on to produce Resident Evil. Sweet Home heavily inspired the Resident Evil series, and is regarded as a survival horror game in retrospect.
