Big Challenge! Go! Go! Bowling is the fourth and final game in the diverse Big Challenge series of Jaleco Famicom Disk System games, and the very last FDS game from Jaleco themselves. Go! Go! Bowling is a straightforward simulation of ten-pin bowling, the goal of which is to knock down as many pins in as few throws as possible. There are cameos of parodies of famous people including Michael Jackson that you'll bowl against in the main game mode.
