TwinBee is a vertical shoot-em-up heavily influenced by Namco's Xevious. As in Namco's classic, the ship can fire forward with a button, and drop bombs (using their tiny arms) on the ground with another. TwinBee's main distinctive features are the cute fantasy setting, where most of the enemies consist of fruit, and the two player mode. This nowadays common feature must have been one of the elements of its big success at times - Gradius and R-Type were both strictly single player experiences, and most of its competition still relied on letting the two players take turns. Twinbee and Winbee can also interact in several ways: they can unite (by holding hands) to shoot a powerful fire bullet. Perhaps more fun and effective, one ship can push the other to produce a spread bullet shot. Also, instead of getting killed outright by enemy bullets, your TwinBees will lose their limbs. When they're fully incapicitated, a little ambulance comes out from the screen, ready to resuscitate them - if you can make it. This emphasis on teamwork was undoubtedly why the title of the game is "TwinBee."
