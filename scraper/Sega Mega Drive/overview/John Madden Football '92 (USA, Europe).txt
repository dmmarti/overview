This update of the John Madden football series offers several new features over its predecessor: instant replays, different weather conditions, player injuries and the ability to review and overturn pass interference calls.

Play modes include Pre-Season, Regular Season, Playoffs and Sudden Death. There are 28 teams plus one All-Madden team.
