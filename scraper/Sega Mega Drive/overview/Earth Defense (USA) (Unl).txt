Aliens have invaded Earth. In order to do battle with them the United Nations of the Earth create a flying craft called the Phoenix Spitfire. Now it's time to do battle with this alien menace.

The player must fly through five vertically-scrolling levels while shooting down enemy crafts and then fight a boss at the end of each level. The Phoenix Spitfire is equipped with a standard cannon that can be upgraded by finding power-ups throughout the levels left by defeated enemies. Upgrades include the Tri-Shot, Napalm Bomb, Rear Shots, and support drones.

This is an unlicensed game.
