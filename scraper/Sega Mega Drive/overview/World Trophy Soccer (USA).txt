European Club Soccer is a reworking of Manchester United Europe, using the same side-view gameplay and a wider view than Krisalis' other football game of the time, John Barnes' European Football.

All the teams who were in contention for one of the 3 main European tournaments as they were at the time of the game's release are included, although with fictitious player names and a few inaccurate kits. Cutscenes detail the match's progress, while a referee is active on the screen. The game can be played in arcade or simulation modes, with 6 different formations available.
