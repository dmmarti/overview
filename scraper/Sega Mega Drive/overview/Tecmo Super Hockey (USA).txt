Tecmo's take on ice hockey, Tecmo Super Hockey features the license from the NHLPA, having the top players of the game at the time. It offers exhibition and regular games as well as playing a season with updated stats and the ability to play in the All-Star game as well. Gameplay is similar to other games, with buttons to pass, shoot, making slap-shots and fake shots, as well as fighting, which is not a common feature. It can be played by two players simultaneously.
