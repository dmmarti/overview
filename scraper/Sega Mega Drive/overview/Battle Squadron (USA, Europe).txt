Battle Squadron is a classic arcade style shooter for 1 or 2 players.You take a space ship and fly it over a high tech hostile surface, and then into an organic setting.  

You can control the number of 'credits' you have from 1 to 3.  You choose how many lives you get.  You also get to choose the max number of enemy bullets and their speed.

You get powerups along the way that modify your weapons, and also the "Nova Smart Bomb".
