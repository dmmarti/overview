R.B.I. Baseball 4 is yet another update to Tengen's baseball franchise, updating the stats and legacy teams for the 1991 season. Just like the previous version, division champions back to 1983 are available, and now includes not only player names, but also all team names and each team's stadium. The game also features a management mode where custom teams can be created, as well as new Home Run Derby and Game Breakers modes.
