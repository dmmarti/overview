On the edge of the universe, the evil intergalactic goblin Grim Squidge has captured and imprisoned all the stars. He has now scattered them across to faraway planets. While this is happening, a nearby space station picks up a distress signal. Tinhead, guardian of the edge of the universe, hears the cries for help and hurries to the rescue.

The gameplay is somewhat different than your typical platformer. There is some exploration required to find the exit or if you want to get health or points. You attack your enemies by shooting them with small metal orbs that come out of TinHead's head. You can shoot them in three different directions: diagonal upward, straight, or just let them jump out and bounce over the ground. The direction is chosen by using a specific button.
