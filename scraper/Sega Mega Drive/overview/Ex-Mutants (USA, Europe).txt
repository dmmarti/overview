In the game you have to stop mutant Lord Sluggo. You and five of your comrades are not mutants as the everybody on the Earth has become and you know how to recreate the human race after the nuclear war. You have to acquire six genetically pure samples. All you need is to save your comrades from Sluggo, slashing with your battle axe through 11 levels of a wasteland that calls itself Sluggtown.
