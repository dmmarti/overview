Released about the same time as Bill Walsh College Football 95, this American football game was unlicensed and did not feature any big names to it.  It was considered a clone of NFL Football '94 Starring Joe Montana, just an updated version but now with college teams. It features 32 college powerhouses from four major divisions, letting you play exhibition games or letting you compete in a tournament to achieve an #1 ranking, as opposed to competing in a season to obtain it.  It also has the option to play it on Team Player letting you control four players at once.
