Based on Troma's cartoon series of the same name,  the Toxic Crusaders protect the city of Tromaville against the plots of the alien Dr. Killemoff and his Radiation Rangers. That is, until Killemoff captures all of the Toxic Crusaders save one. As Toxie, you must "mop up" Killemoff's forces through 6 levels and rescue his comrades before it's too late.

The game is action-oriented. Toxie's only abilities are to jump and to punch his way through enemies. He initially starts with a mop weapon, which can be easily lost.
