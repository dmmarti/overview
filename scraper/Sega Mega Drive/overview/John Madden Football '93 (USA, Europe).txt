Another update in the Madden football series. New this time are some graphics and animations, including an animated coin toss and some player moves. New gameplay features are no-huddle offense and a stop clock play.

There are 28 teams from the '92-'93 season, two All Madden teams and 8 Greatest Ever teams.

Game modes are the usual pre-season, regular season, sudden death and playoffs. A special playoff mode for the 8 greatest teams is also available.

The Genesis version features John Madden's digitized commentary speech and a battery-backed RAM for saving playoff results and player stats.
