An alien entity known as Geegus threatens the Earth in the year 3091.  As all of Earth's forces have been defeated, a scientist uses his recently-built time machine to find the greatest fighters of different eras to compete against Geegus.

Featuring a cast of characters ranging from ninjas to a cybernetic supersoldier, you'll fight your way through standard-fare one-on-one matches or take on an opponent in a Deathmatch, where spiked walls and landmines add to the danger.
