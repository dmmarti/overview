The central character in this game is Spot, the little red guy from the 7-Up TV commercials.  Spot has somehow become trapped in a movie projector.  As he jumps from film to film, he encounters many classic film genres that make up all the different levels of the game.  The main levels are a pirate movie, an adventure movie, and a horror movie, but there are many other bonus films to unlock.

The game is played from an isometric perspective.  As you control spot, you have to collect 5 Hollywood stars per level to unlock hidden areas and ultimately complete the game 100%.
