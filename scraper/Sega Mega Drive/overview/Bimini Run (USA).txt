You are Kenji Ohara, a motor boat expert. The evil Dr. Orca has kidnapped your sister Kim. Together with your best friend Luka you must find his hideout on a deserted island, and rescue your sister from his clutches. But that won't be easy, as Dr. Orca has sent his henchmen to stop you!

This is a sailing action game. You navigate your motor boat from a third person perspective view, increasing and decreasing your speed, avoiding yachts and other obstacles, and shooting down the enemies who are trying to stop you.
