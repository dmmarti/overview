Super Real Basketball uses a scrolling court-side view to recreate the game, with 8 teams representing major US cities.These can play in Exhibition and Tournament matches, with a 2-player mode and 3 skill levels. Before each match you can choose between zonal and man-to-man marking, and this can be changed after each quarter, or during a time out. Physical contact  fouls is impossible although 'traveling' is called. Tip-offs and Slam-Dunk attempts switch to a 3D close-up view, and are controlled by hammering the B button as hard as possible - on occasion you can get defense players in to block an attempted dunk.
