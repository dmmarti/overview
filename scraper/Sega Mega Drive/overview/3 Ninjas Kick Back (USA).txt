You must help an old samurai to retrieve a dagger he once got as an award for his achievements in martial arts. The dagger was stolen by somebody who envied the old warrior - now he cannot give this prize to the warriors of the next generation. Choose one of the three young ninjas to help the old man!

This is a traditional platform game based on the movie 3 Ninjas Kick Back. Each one of the three ninjas has unique weapons and abilities. All three of them can run, duck, crawl, climb, jump, and hang on trees, ropes, etc. You'll encounter many obstacles and enemies, both regular and boss-like, which you'll have to overcome and defeat.
