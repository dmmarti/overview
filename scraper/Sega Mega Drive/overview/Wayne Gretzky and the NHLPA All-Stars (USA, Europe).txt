It also features the 26 NHL teams at the time as well as 6 International teams to choose from.

There is also a "Simulation Mode" that gives the game an authentic feel complete with penalties or an "Arcade Mode" that was more action oriented and with less rules.  A battery back-up keeps extensive track of stats and has a two-player option as well.
