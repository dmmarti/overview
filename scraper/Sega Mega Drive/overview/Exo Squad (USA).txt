Based on the American animated television series of the same name that ran between 1993 and 1994, this game puts the player in the mecha-like Exo-Frames of three pilots: Lt. J.T. Marsh, Sgt. Rita Torres, and Wolf Bronksy. Each pilot's levels have a distinct mechanic, ranging from After Burner-esque behind the shoulder fight action, to platforming, and side-scrolling beat-em-up gameplay.
