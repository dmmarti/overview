This simulation puts you in the cockpit of the F-22. You can choose from 3 difficulty settings and fly strike missions in 4 theaters of war (United States, Iraq, Korea and Russia) with increasing difficulty. You can also challenge aces from each theater and design custom missions.
To complete a mission, you usually have to destroy both ground and air targets, including several MiG types, helicopters and tanks in addition to ground structures. Use realistic weapons like Sidewinder and Maverick missiles.
