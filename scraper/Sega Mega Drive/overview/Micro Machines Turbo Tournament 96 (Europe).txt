Micro Machines: Turbo Tournament 96 is a sequel to Micro Machines 2 and although the gameplay and the typical top-down view still remain the same, this fun racing game offers a great number of new features.

Besides Challenge-Race, Head to Head-Race, League-Race, Time Trial Challenge-Race and Time Trial-Race, an outstanding Multiplayer Mode is included with the J-Cart. Just plug two additional joypads into the cartridge slots and up to 8 (!) players can race simultaneously on the same track (always two players sharing one pad). With an included Construction Kit, you can even create own tracks and store them. Up to nine tracks can be saved.
