World Series Baseball is the first game in the long-running SEGA series. With all 28 teams it featured the then brand new 6 division alignment and had all 700 players. It has a play-by-play feature, the Home Run Derby and players are able to play a 162-game season and are able to keep full statistics for every player, thanks to a battery backup. It also allows players to use the first-person perspective view from the batters box.
