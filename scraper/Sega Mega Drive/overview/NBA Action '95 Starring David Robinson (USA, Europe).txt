This is the sequel to NBA Action '94 with the standard modes (Exhibition, Season, etc.) and features 300 top players of the 1994 NBA season and all 27 NBA teams and their respective logos.  Players can also edit their own team's roster and create up to 40 different custom players that can be saved to the game's battery back-up.  The game not only has former San Antonio Spurs player, David Robinson, endorsing and appearing in the game, but also play-by-play commentator Marv Albert also lends his voice talent to the game.
