Androids is a top down arcade maze game.

CONTROLS
Keyboard, Kempston and sinclair joysticks can be used.  The
keyboard controls are redefineable.

INSTRUCTIONS
The aim of each level is to find the exit, which will take you
onto the next level.  The exit to each level is like a square
flashing vortex which you simply walk into.

You can move around the maze using the keys, and shoot the green
aliens by using the fire button, causing you to shoot in the
direction you are currently facing.  You only have limited ammo,
so you must walk into the coloured squares marked "G" to gain
more shots.  They are quite common.

You also only have a limited number of shields, which can be
depleted by walking into or being shot by one of the aliens. 
This too can be replenshed by walking into the coloured squares
marked "S".  Both your number of shots and shield level is shown
at the top of the screen, along with your score.

The cyan coloured squares on the map are doors, and the aliens
cannot walk through these.  The map also wraps around, so you can
end up going in circles, and it seems a lot bigger than it
actually is.
