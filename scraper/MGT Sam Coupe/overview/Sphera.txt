Sphera is a vertically scrolling shoot 'em up. Sphera is also the Emperor's most feared artificial prison planet and the player happens to be one of its inmates. Sent there by a scheming business partner he wants no more than escape and get his revenge. The player gets his chance when suddenly a supply ships breaks down and before it can be repaired the player takes control of it. Now the goal is to fight through the game's three levels full of defence droids and guard ships and find freedom. The gameplay is typical of the genre. The player controls his space ship and has to shoot down the many enemies that appear around him. The player has an energy bar indicating how much damage he can take from enemy fire. When it's empty or he collides with an enemy ship he loses a life. The player starts with five lives and can earn more. Other pick-ups include energy and weapons. There is an end boss for each level and these include a giant crab and a scorpion.
