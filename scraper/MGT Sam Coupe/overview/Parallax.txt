Parallax is a side scrolling shoot 'em up set in outer space. It is similar to the game Sidewize in that enemies appear in waves of different formations and the player has to shoot down as many of them as possible without colliding with them or getting hit by any of their projectiles. Initially the player's ship shoots single bullets at a time but by clearing out a full wave of enemies it's possible to get a power up that gives multiple shots. The kind of shot to use can be selected before starting out. Enemies appear from all sides of the screen and it's of important to find the right safe spot before they arrive. Any collision leads to a life being lost. The game has twelve levels and each one ends with a boss fight against a powerful guardian enemy.
