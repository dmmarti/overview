Your main objective on each screen is to match atoms with the crystals on the screen, so that they disappear in a burst of energy.nnnnThere are several different type blocks to help you on the way, including teleporters, swappers, eyes, disintegrators and magnets.nnnnYou can go to any level by typing a password when you start the game and you'll get a password when you end a game with a high-score.nnnnYou get 1000 points for each crystal when you complete a screen and every retry costs 200 points.nnnnClick the atoms so that they spin (selected) and then click the pointer away from it in the direction you wish the atom to move (goto).
