The Witching Hour is a puzzle platformer. The player can choose to control either a witch called Gretta or a wizard called Beardy. The game takes place in a small village by the sea that has been raided by ghosts and demons led by the evil demon master. Many villagers have been captured and those that escape have come to the player who is the only person with the magical power needed to rescue them. But it has to be done before midnight so the player only has one hour, the witching hour, to complete the mission.

The player controls the character with direct control like in other platform games but the game is more focused on puzzle solving than precision jumping. The player can move back and forth between the locations while avoiding dangers and interacting with characters and objects. Jumping and moving around is done with the joystick while pressing a button brings up a menu that is used for all other interactions. Similar to an adventure game, the following six commands can be used: pick up, drop, talk, use, examine and give. Most puzzles involve using an object at the right location or giving it to the right character. Only two objects can be carried at the same time.
