Demon's Winter is a fantasy role-playing game set in an immense, highly-detailed world that promises days of discovery, adventure and excitement.
The five characters that make up your party can be Humans, Dwarves, Elves or Dark Elves, each rated for speed, strength, intellect, endurance and skill. As the game progresses and they gain in experience, these attributes will increase. They can belong to any of ten classes, ranging from Barbarian and Thief to Wizard and Scholar.
When the game begins, the heroes are merely concerned with Kobolds, small, sharp-toothed humanoids led by goblins. Soon, they learn of a much greater threat--the demon-god Malifon!
Although Malifon is trapped inside a volcano, he is far from powerless. Gathering all his mystical energy, he cast a spell so mighty that the entire world was thrown into a deep, frigid winter and the oceans turned into crimson blood! In this desolate setting, his minions thrive to carry out their duty: Free Malifon so he can rule the world!
Your mission is clear: Search the lands and seas of this vast world for the spells needed to trap Malifon forever and undo his wintry curse.
Though the Demon's Winter may chill your bodies, may courage, honor and perseverance warm your souls!
