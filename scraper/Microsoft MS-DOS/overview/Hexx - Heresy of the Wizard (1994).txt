Somewhere on the top floor of a sinister tower, there is an evil wizard who likes conjuring powerful deities. Those mighty creatures threaten the wizard, but they are trapped in magical cages, unable to act. To prevent the revenge of gods, the wizard imprisoned the souls of the four greatest gods in four talismans, and then hid them in four different dungeons. Controlling a party of adventurers, you must retrieve these talismans and release the gods.
