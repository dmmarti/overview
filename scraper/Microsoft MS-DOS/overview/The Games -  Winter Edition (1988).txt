The Games - Winter Edition is the follower of Winter Games. Epyx has chosen a new selection of events. Some events were already available in Winter Games, while others are new in The Games. Together with the Winter Games is The Games a nice collection of Olympic disciplines. As it was common with sports games of that time, there are some disciplines that call on the player to destroy the joystick by jolting it too much.
The game is designed for up to 8 players. The players receive points for successfully ending a discipline. For each gold medal you get 5 points, for each silver medal 3 points and one point for each bronze medal. The player with the most points wins the game.
Epyx has secured a license from the Olympic Commitee of the United States for The Games - Winter Edition and The Games - Summer Edition.
The disciplines are partially divided into several sections in which the player has to do another action with the joystick.
