The bumbling bachelor, Rex Nebular, has been hired by Colonel Stone to retrieve a vase that holds some sentimental value. Stone offers Rex 75,000 galactars for the return of the vase. Rex agrees and sets out for the last known location of the vase.

He discovers that the planet where the vase was last known to reside has vanished, but his ship's sensors still detect a planetary mass and gravitational field, although none can be seen with the naked eye. Before he is given a chance to investigate further, a large warship decloaks behind him, and fires. His ship is badly damaged and careens towards the planetary mass. He crash-lands on a strange planet, seemingly inhabited by women only. He sets off in search of the vase and a way to get off the planet.

Decades ago, a vicious war between the sexes erupted on the planet. The males focused on developing mechanical and electronic weaponry, while the females focused on biological warfare. In the end, the females unleashed a biological weapon that eliminated the male population. Due to side effects caused by the biological weapon, the females were no longer able to give birth to males, so they had no way of continuing their species. So they invented a machine that would allow them to alter their sex for short periods of time. This machine became known as the Cosmic Gender Bender, or the Gender Bender for short.

The populace of the planet is divided into two classes, Keepers and (breeding) Stock. The Keepers are technologically advanced and reside underground, where they monitor the Stock. The Stock reside above ground and have a primitive culture. Their only purpose is to be impregnated by a gender bent Keeper in order to repopulate the planet.
