It's the Earth's Stellar Guard against the alien Drak-sai. Now's the time to strap in and set the skies on fire! Blistering bombs explode; shields buckle but hold. Your reflexes better be faster than theirs; 'cause there's trouble over every mountain and in every tunnel. Bury the stick in a snap roll. Scream through 20 rounds of non-stop destruction and killer 3D texture-mapped terrains. Save Game feature allows time for refueling. Space sickness bags not included.
