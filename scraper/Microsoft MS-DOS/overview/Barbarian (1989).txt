The once tranquil land of Barbaria has been cursed. Clouded under a dark shroud of death and disease, the world is slowly being eaten alive. The man responsible, a powerful wizard named Zaugg, has convinced the people throughout the land that there is no hope for their existence, and that his rule is the one and only.

But there is a prophecy. The foretelling of a great Barbarian warrior who will rise up against the wizard Zaugg and bring balance to the land. Alas what identity will the legendary warrior take? Could it be the revenge-minded Dagan of Dolok? Or maybe Magnus, Lord of the Undead; perhaps even Zaugg's own apprentice Corath will be the end of the spiteful necromancer. The answer is not clear, but that is where you come in. Assuming the role of 10 unique combatants, it is your duty to defeat the monstrous soul and finally give a happy ending to this sad, twisted story.
