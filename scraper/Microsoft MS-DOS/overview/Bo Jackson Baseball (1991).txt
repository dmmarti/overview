It is based on Bo Jackson's baseball career.  An option allows the player to play anywhere from five to nine innings.  Nintendo Power gave this game a 2.8 out of 5 in their September 1991 review while Electronic Gaming Monthly issued a 4.25 out of 10 review in their October 1991 issue of their magazine.  Players can either play in exhibition mode or playoff mode. Either one or two players can participate.  In addition to those options, a CPU vs CPU mode and a CPU vs CPU quick mode are available in order to quicken up a tournament; the purpose is to see the stats of that particular match and quickly end tournaments.  The game uses city names but not the team names because of not having any proper licensing with Major League Baseball.  However, the players are purely fictional and they cannot be edited.  Some of the player names are parodies of real life baseball players (such as Baltimore's "Kenrip" being a not-so-subtle parody of Cal Ripken).  There is even a cheat code that allows players to play as an all-Bo Jackson baseball team.
