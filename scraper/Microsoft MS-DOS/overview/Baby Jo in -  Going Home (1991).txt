Baby Jo is a quite fun jump'n run game by Loriciel - a bit similar to SEGA's classic Wonderboy. You are baby Jo, a baby (in diapers, no less) who has to struggle through many levels to find his way home. Being a baby, you don't naturally have 100-ton bazooka to blast enemies with, but you do have natural weapons that are quite hilarious (I'll keep them a secret for now-- just try the game ;)).

Overall, Baby Jo isn't truly original, but like all Loriciel game, breaks the mold of typical platform game. Definitely worth a look, but don't hold your breath for something revolutionary.
