Floor 13 is a single-player computer game set in the United Kingdom, where the player is the director of a secret governmental agency involved in clandestine domestic operations. The headquarters is hidden on the thirteenth floor of a building in London Docklands, hence the title. The game was developed in 1991 by Virgin Interactive, a now-defunct division of the Virgin Group.
