Nothing is quite as it seems in this creepy, futuristic role-playing game. The year is 2227, and you've been sent by the mighty DDT Corporation to take some atmospheric readings on the planet Albion. Initially, it seems that the planet is barren (though rich with resources), but when your ship's systems fail, you soon discover a whole community of alien life forms living in harmony. Soon, your ship begins to act on its own, and it seems that the DDT Corporation had designs on destroying the planet all along! Live or die, it's up to you to stop your employer before it's too late.
