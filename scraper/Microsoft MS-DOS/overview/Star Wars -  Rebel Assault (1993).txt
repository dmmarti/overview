The game follows the adventures of a young pilot known as Rookie One, a farmer from Tatooine in the style of Luke Skywalker. The game largely takes place during the events of Episode IV: A New Hope, however the sequences on Hoth from The Empire Strikes Back are included.
The game begins with Rookie One's training (you), followed by an attack on the Star Destroyer Devastator, after its capture of the Tantive IV in the events of the film. The story then leads the player to sequences to defend the Rebel Base on Hoth from the attack shown in the Empire Strikes Back, and finally ends in the assault on the Death Star of the film, with the player taking the place of Luke Skywalker in destroying the battle station.
