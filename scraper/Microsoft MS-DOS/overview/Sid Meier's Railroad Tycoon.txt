Empire Building in the Golden Age of Railroads

Big business. Touch decisions. Excitement, challenge and compelling attention to detail. Railroad Tycoon re-creates the Golden Age of Railroads in any of four regions in America and Europe, and gives you complete control over every aspect of your industrial empire. But be careful: the world's other tycoons - like J.P. Morgan, Vanderbilt and Carnegie - are fierce competitors, determined to crush you or brush you from their path. Named Best Strategy Game by the Software Publishers' Association!
