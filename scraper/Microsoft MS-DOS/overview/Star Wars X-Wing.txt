X-Wing is a space combat simulation, the first in the Star Wars universe. From the cockpits of X-Wing, Y-Wing and A-Wing starfighters, players fight for the Rebel Alliance in their struggle against the evil Galactic Empire.

The main part of the game consists of three separate campaigns, called Tours of Duty. The Tours can be played in any order, even though they build on each other story-wise: Tour I, 'A New Ally', tells of the Rebellion's search for political allies in their fight against the Empire, while the Emperor launches Operation Strike Fear, a major offensive against the Rebels. Tour II, 'The Great Search' chronicles the Rebels' search for the plans to the Empire's new superweapon, the Death Star. Tour III, 'The Gathering Storm', tells of their efforts to find and destroy the battle station. Animated cutscenes are featured after certain missions to continue the story.
