The Clue! (known as Der Clou! in Austria) is a remake of the 1986 game They Stole a Million. It would form a two-game series, with a sequel following in 2001, under the guise of The Sting! or Der Clou 2!. In 2000 the source code was released to the public.[2][3] The game was since then ported to modern platforms (Windows, Linux) via SDL and receives still updates by the game's community (2015).[4]
