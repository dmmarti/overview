Raptor fans look-out! The best PC shooter is here! The graphics, music and sound effects in Stargunner are simply brilliant. This game sets a new standard is PC shooter graphics and a level of detail and animation that's not been seen on the PC before. Okay, this is all sounding like too much hype but when you've got the best what else can you say. ;)

The shareware version has 6 blast-a-thon levels, with space levels, land-based levels and finally an underwater excursion. The full game has 34 levels, more weapons, four cinematics and all the good stuff.
