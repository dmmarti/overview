"World Class Soccer" is a soccer video game developed by Tiertex in 1990.[1]

Reception[edit]
Computer Gaming World criticized the game for only displaying about 10% of the field at a time without a "radar" screen to show the rest, but liked the animation. The magazine concluded that "World Class Soccer should prove an informative and reasonably entertaining way to prepare for the event".[2]
