Bio Menace is a 2D, side-scrolling, platform game developed and published by Apogee Software in 1993 for MS-DOS. It was built on a licensed version of id Software's Commander Keen game engine, and was known as Bio Hazard during production. Apart from the engine and music, all in-game content was created by the game's designer, Jim Norwood.

The player controls the protagonist, Snake Logan, a top CIA operative. Upon receiving reports of Metro City being invaded by mutants, Logan is ordered to fly recon over the city. However, after crash landing in Metro City, Logan is forced to complete his mission on foot.

The game has three episodes, the first of which was released as shareware, the rest being available commercially. The episodes are "Dr. Mangle's Lab", "The Hidden Lab" and "Master Cain". Sales of the game were discontinued in 2000 due to problems with more modern operating systems. Apogee released the game as freeware on December 23, 2005 as a "Christmas present" and the full game can be downloaded from the Apogee website. It is likely that this decision was made due to the results of an earlier poll on the 3D Realms forums, where visitors could pick a game they would like to see released as freeware from a list of discontinued Apogee games. On 23 October 2014, 3D Realms released 3D Realms Anthology, which included Bio Menace in the collection.
