The story begins in Moscow, Russia. You play as Doug - an international thief who robs museum treasures for a living. You enter a contest so that you can appear on a talk show, and in turn find a secret passage into the museum. But just as the crown is within your grasp, you are knocked unconscious by another thief who takes the crown for himself. You later awaken to find the sirens going off - the authorities are after you, and Doug has no choice but to escape Moscow via train.
