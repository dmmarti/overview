It's 1950, you've been loaned £100,000 and you've got 100 years to prove yourself a Transport Tycoon. Transport Tycoon Deluxe presents you with a choice of four vast game worlds (each of which will randomly generate a limitless number of gameplay scenarios) made up of numerous small towns and raw material resources. If you'd prefer, you can even create your own game scenarios using the world editor.
