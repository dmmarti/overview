As a graduate of the Famous Adventurers' Correspondence School, you're more than qualfied to battle brigands, massacre monsters and rescue royalty. If you're eager to exercise your new credentials, you've come to the right place. The barony of Spielburg is in dire need of a champion, and you just might fit the bill!
Hero's Quest I combines Sierra's 3-D Animated Adventure Game style, with the creative character building of role-playing games. Create your own character from the ground up, and venture forth into a world of magic. Become a mysterious magician, a fierce fighter or a wily thief, and select the skills and attributes you think will serve you best.
Hero's Quest I is three games in one. You can play again using your enhanced skills, or create another character who will approach problems in a different way.
