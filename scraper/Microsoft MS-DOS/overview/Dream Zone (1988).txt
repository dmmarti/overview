Compute! stated that the game "truly conveys a dream-like feeling". The magazine praised its satire and the IIGS version's graphics, and stated that "it's hard to believe that the program was written by two high school juniors".[3] A later Compute! review praised the graphics, story, and interface.[4] The game was reviewed in 1988 in Dragon #134 by Hartley, Patricia, and Kirk Lesser in "The Role of Computers" column. The reviewers gave the game 5 out of 5 stars.[2]
