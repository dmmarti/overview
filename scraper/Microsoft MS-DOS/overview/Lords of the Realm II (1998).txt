Lords of the Realm II is very different from many medieval strategy games. There is no magic, and unlike many strategy games, it has no technology tree. Players need to carefully manage food, population, and happiness levels whilst avoiding Malthusian population meltdowns. The game is a combination of a turn-based resource management game; in which players grow crops, accumulate resources, manufacture weapons, manage armies, build and lay siege to castles, and attempt to conquer their enemies; and a real-time strategy game, with players able to control units individually or in group formations.
Compared to the original, Lords of the Realm II is much more robust, with better graphics and music, and an improved management system.
