Like its predecessor, Beyond Castle Wolfenstein is a combination action and adventure game. 
It is set in World War II during Adolf Hitler's rule as Chancellor of Germany. 
The objective of the game is to traverse all the levels of the secret Berlin bunker where the Führer is holding secret meetings with his senior staff. 
The player must retrieve a bomb that the operatives have placed inside the bunker and place it outside the door of the room where Hitler is holding his meeting, a scenario bearing a passing resemblance to the July 20 Plot.
