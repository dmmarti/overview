High Seas Trader is a naval strategy video game. The player runs trade routes, fends off pirates, collects artifact and offers transport to fellow countrymen in need, all for the sake of climbing up the game’s ranking ladder, which in turn allows the player to buy bigger ships, more firepower and larger cargo holds to progress quicker in the ranks.
