Get ready for your most dangerous adventure yet, Indiana Jones! The ruthless high priest Mola Ram has enslaved the children of Mayapore and stolen the sacred and powerful Sankara Stones. Your quest to free the captives and find the hidden treasure takes you through treacherous caverns and twisting tunnels, across narrow ledges and fiery chasms in the perilous Temple of Doom. Use your trusty bullwhip to battle fierce Thuggee guards, giant spiders, and dive-bombing bats. With skill and a little bit of luck, you might just make it out of this one alive!
