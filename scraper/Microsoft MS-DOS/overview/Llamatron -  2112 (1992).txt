The player controls a llama which can move on a single-screen playfield. The llama constantly fires a stream of white energy bolts in the direction it is moving. The player can 'hold' the fire direction, so that the llama can move freely whilst firing in a direction; alternatively the player can control the game with two joysticks, choosing the move and fire directions independently.
