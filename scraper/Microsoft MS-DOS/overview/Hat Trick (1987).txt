What a night for a hockey game! After weeks of intensive training on the ice, you're finally at the face-off, waiting for the starting whistle. As the puck slides across the smooth, icy surface, you take it at center ice, managing to break over the blue line to your opponent's right. Whoooossh. What reflexes! What speed!

The spray of the ice on your face momentarily blinds you, but you continue to skate furiously, weaving towards the opposing goal. You can feel your challenger's hot breath on the back of your neck, as the distance between you grows smaller and smaller. But before he can manage to steal the puck, you swing your stick and whack -- it's a slapshot! The point is yours!

Get three goals in a game, and it's a hat trick!
