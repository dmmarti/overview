Fighter Wing is a flight simulator that instead of concentrating on a single type of aircraft, covers a wide array of flyable planes. You get to play in either Nato or soviet sides in a series of scenarios (no campaign mode) that take place over fictional situations (the President goes insane and orders a massive strike, etc.). On the Nato side, you can fly the F-4, F-15, F-16, F-18 and F-117. While on the Soviet side you get the MIG-21, 23, 29, 31 and the SU-27.
