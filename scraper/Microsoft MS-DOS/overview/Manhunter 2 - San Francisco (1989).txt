Manhunter 2: San Francisco is a post-apocalyptic adventure game designed by Barry Murry, Dave Murry, and Dee Dee Murry of Evryware and published in 1989 by Sierra On-Line. It is the sequel to Manhunter: New York, developed by the same authors.
The game continues the story depicted in Manhunter: New York. The game begins with the player, piloting an Orb ship in pursuit of the antagonist Phil Cook, crash-landing in San Francisco. Another Manhunter on the ground is killed in the crash, so the player assumes his identity. As the gameplay progresses, the player learns of an organized resistance, experiments that have created mutant slaves, and the goal of the malevolent Orbs. The game reaches its climax when the player is on the verge of catching Phil Cook. Phil narrowly escapes in an Orb ship with the player hanging on to the outside, flying off towards London
