The first in the "Gold Box" trilogy of Dragonlance games, Champions of Krynn takes place in Krynn as the allies try to recover after the War of the Lance. The player controls a party of up to 6 companions who can be any of several races and classes. The game follows very closely to the Advanced Dungeons and Dragons ruleset, with dice roles being replaced by a random number generator. The game has several perspectives, showing the player as a dot on the map view, a top-down view in combat, and a very early first-person perspective in towns and dungeons.
