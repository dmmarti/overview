Pushover is a platform puzzle game in which the plot revolves around the then Quavers mascot "Colin Curly' losing his Quavers packets down a giant ant hill. The player is tasked with controlling 'G.I. Ant', a large soldier ant, to recover the Quavers by solving a series of puzzles.

The game consists of 100 levels of increasing complexity over nine different themed worlds. Each level features several interconnected platforms holding a number of "dominoes". The aim is to rearrange the dominoes, such that with a single push, all of the dominoes are toppled, thus opening the exit to the next level. There are 11 different types of domino, identified by red and yellow patterns, each with different actions. The player controls G.I. Ant, who can move certain dominoes by carrying them one at a time.
