MECHWARRIOR 2 gives you the chance to strap yourself into a 40-ton hunk of metal armed with a full arsenal of weapons and wreak havoc on a futuristic band of enemies. The game features eight brand new missions and 32 reworked versions of popular PC campaigns. At the outset of the game you can choose between the Wolf Clan and Jade Falcon squads, or opt for the "instant action" feature to jump right into the fray. No matter which route you take, be ready for some explosive action, as every mission calls for you to destroy something.
