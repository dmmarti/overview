Dragonsphere is a graphic adventure in the classic third-person LucasArts and Sierra style, and the third adventure game by MicroProse, similar visually and gameplay-wise to Rex Nebular and the Cosmic Gender Bender. The interaction with the game world is performed by applying one of the ten different verb commands to objects and/or people. The game has vast amounts of unique text responses to player's actions and branching dialogue with characters. The puzzles are, for the most part, inventory-based. The game features hand-painted backgrounds and some digitized animation.
