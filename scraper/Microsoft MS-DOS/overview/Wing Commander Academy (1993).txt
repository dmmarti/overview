A Stand-Alone Game — No previous Wing Commander experience necessary.

As a student at the TCSN Academy, you custom-design and fly unique combat, rescue, and search and retrieval missions from the CyberSchool's holographic simulator. In the Wing Commander tradition, the game features a dynamic musical score, improved bit-mapped graphics, and a dazzling array of customizing options. But Wing Commander Academy is not another cinematic extravaganza — it's an intense dogfighting marathon.

- Custom-design a variety of missions that match your skill level as you place fighters, capital ships, mine fields, asteroid fields, data pods and ejected pilots - up to 10 in each of the four action spheres. 

- Save up to 24 games to disk and trade with your friends or upload them to bulletin boards to challenge others. 

- Request random missions where each action sphere yields an unknown number of enemy ships with pilots of varying skill levels. 

- Climb into the cockpits of the new Confederation Wraith or Kilrathi Jrathek fighters for a new combat experience. 

- Select a cybernet wingman — from a frightened cadet to a hotshot veteran. 

- Fly from the cockpit or try the chase plane view for a new perspective on the intense dogfighting action. 

- Sharpen your combat skills as you compete for high-point honors. 

- Engage the "Gauntlet" - a dogfighting marathon with 15 progressively difficult levels of attacking ships - including three flights of fighters in each level.
