MS-Flight Simulator is modelled after the performance characteristics
of an aircraft of the Cessna 182 class (single engine, land, with
substantial performance). It is an ideal plane for pilot training
because it has climb performance and speed that keep a pilot busy,
especially on landing approach. The plane is slightly superior to an
advanced World War I fighter.

MS-Flight Simulator can provide hours of rewarding entertainment.
ln addition to the easy and realistic simulation modes, it includes
the British Ace war game, which lets you test your dogfighting and
bombing skills.
