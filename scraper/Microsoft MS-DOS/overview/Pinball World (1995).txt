Play on tables based on locales from all over the world, earn enough points and you can trek your way through Africa to the North Pole. It’s not as simple as activating all the lights on a table, however. You’ll need to steer your ocean liner across the Atlantic and navigate harsh deserts in your buggy in a series of challenging mini-games if you really want to travel to every corner of the Earth.
