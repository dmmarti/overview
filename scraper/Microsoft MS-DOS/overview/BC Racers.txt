It’s pre-hysterical!  Millionaire playboy caveman Millstone Rockafella arranges a wild n’ wacky BC bike race, the winner of which receives the ultimate boulderdash bike.  Cool n’ crazy Cliff Ace has had his sunglasses set on a boulderdash bike since he was knee-high, so he signs up for the race - taking his cave-babe Roxy along for the ride!  The 32X pushes graphics to the limit with 256 colors for in-game graphics and full 24-bit for static display.  The stone-age never looked better!
