Dominus is an unreleased Sega Mega Drive strategy game developed by Virtual Concepts and set to be published by Asciiware. It was cancelled for unknown reasons, though a IBM PC port published by U.S. Gold was released in 1994. A SNES version was also planned but suffered a similar fate.

A prototype ROM, dated 1993 has since been unearthed, showing an incomplete game without any sound.
