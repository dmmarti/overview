Aces of the Pacific is a combat flight simulator game developed by Dynamix and published by Sierra Entertainment in 1992. The game takes place during World War II. Player can choose single or instant mission, or choose to take a career path in United States Army Air Forces, United States Navy, United States Marines, Imperial Japanese Army or Imperial Japanese Navy. Its success caused Dynamix to create a very similar follow-up Aces Over Europe in 1993.
