Titan takes the Breakout concept and adds another dimension by allowing the object the player controls to be able to move on the Y-axis in addition to the old X-axis. The display will follow the small square which the player controls as it moves on a map where there are objects whom your goal is to make a ball hit. The player controls a small rectangle only slightly larger than the size of the ball itself and in addition to hitting the "bricks" to destroy them has to keep the ball away from dangerous hazards which will kill the ball if it hits.
