The game consists of a single 21-level episode, 19 of which need to be completed in order to win the game. The remaining two levels are secret levels that can be accessed from within the first 18 levels. The gameplay is identical to that of Wolfenstein 3D, which uses the same game engine. The levels can be divided into four blocks ("Tunnels", "Dungeons", "Castle", and "Ramparts"), each ending with the player having to defeat a "boss".
