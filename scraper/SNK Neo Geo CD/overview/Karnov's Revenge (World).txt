The sequel of the first "Fighter's History" this time ported in the Neo Geo MVS Hardware.
In this new verion of the original game several changes and improvement was made for enanching the gameplay : now the battles are more faster and technical, with the usual friendly combo system that makes the fight much spectacular. There are also some powerful hidden moves added for most of the characters. Even the graphic was sligtly enanched, with a nice color palette and some wonderful backgrounds (especially the Zazie's one).
The character roaster now count 13 selectable characters, with the adding of two new entries.
The game actually still suffering for the reputation of 'SFII clone' gived by the general opinion from the times of the first episode, but thanks to this, this new chapter of the saga, ported in the Neo Geo System, was particularly appreciated by the Neo Geo's fans, because is one of the rare 'SFII style' beat'em up on the Neo Geo's catalogue.
A really nice and classical beat'em up, still worty to be played, especially for the real fans of the 2D beat'em up.,
