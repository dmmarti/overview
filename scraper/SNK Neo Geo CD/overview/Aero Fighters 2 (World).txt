The first sequel to the superb vertically scrolling shoot-em-up "Aero Fighters" players once again take control of a Jet fighter aircraft and take to the skies to destroy enemy jets, boats, helicopters, gun emplacements and huge end-of-level bosses. The graphics are every bit as accomplished as those of the prequel and the game delivers a good level of challenge.
The end-of-level bosses change from game-to-game; a nice touch that adds variety to an already solid game.
Players can choose to play as any one of eight different fighter pilots, each of which pilots a different jet :
* American F-117A Nighthawk piloted by Robo-Keaton.
* American A-10 Thunderbolt II piloted by Mao Mao.
* Japanese Fighter-Support X piloted by Hien.
* Japanese F-15 Eagle piloted by Captain Silver.
* International F-14 Tomcat piloted by Cindy and Ellen.
* International YF-23 Black Widow II piloted by Spanky.
* French Rafale piloted by Steve.
* British Sea Harrier FRS2 piloted by Bobby.,
