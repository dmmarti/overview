A colourful and playable ten-pin bowling game for 1 to 4 players, offering a choice of three scoring methods : 'Regulation', 'Flash' and 'Strike 90'.
The game begins with players selecting either a right or left-handed bowler, before choosing what weight they want their bowling balls to be. Once the match starts properly, Power and Direction meters will appear and players must use both their judgement and timing to select and execute the desired bowl. Timing is key as players are only allowed twenty seconds to make each shot.
The 'Strike 90' mode awards players ninety points for a strike and sixty points for a spare. In the 'Flash' game mode, the points flash across the lane as the players throw the ball. Should they succeed in knocking down the standing pins, the points that are displayed at the time the pins are struck will be added to the players' scores.
