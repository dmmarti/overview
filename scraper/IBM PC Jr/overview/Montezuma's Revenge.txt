Originally created in 1983, Montezuma's Revenge became a household name as a huge hit for most popular early home computers and game consoles. Originally developed for the Atari 800 with the 48K expansion module, Montezuma's Revenge would see a release on the Atari 8-bit Atari 2600 and 5200, the Apple II, ColecoVision, Commodore 64, IBM PC, the Sega Master System, and the ZX Spectrum.

Since then, Montezuma's Revenge would receive updated ports including a reboot for Android and iOS platforms, but nothing on the home consoles... until now!

Decades after it was created, Robert would team up with programmer Felipe Reinaud, and Second Dimension to bring Montezuma's Revenge to the NES platform.
