The Seven Cities of Gold is a strategy video game created by Dan Bunten (and the game development team Bunten founded, Ozark Softscape) and published by Electronic Arts in 1984. The player takes the role of a late-15th century explorer for the Spanish Empire, setting sail to the New World in order to explore the map and interact with the natives in order to win gold and please the Spanish court. The name derives from the "seven cities" of Quivira and Cíbola that were said to be located somewhere in the Southwest United States.
