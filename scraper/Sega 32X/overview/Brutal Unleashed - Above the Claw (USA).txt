As with the original Brutal: Paws of Fury, the game involves a martial arts tournament set up by the Dalai Llama. A selection of 12 anthropomorphic animals are involved; choose from them for the cartoon-styled beat 'em up action.  

Characters each have their own fighting style, array of moves, and storyline.  As you progress through the game, you unlock more moves for each character.  There's also a progressive conquest mode which challenges you to take over the entire Brutal Island.
