Virtua Racing Deluxe is an enhanced arcade-to-console conversion of Sega's 3D racing game. This game is primarily an arcade-style affair; Players compete in a 5 lap race with timed checkpoints. It's also possible to play with 2 players in a split-screen mode.

The 32X version of Virtua Racing adds a couple of new features. There are now 3 different types of cars to drive, including a stock car and a prototype racer. Furthermore, there are two all-new tracks.
