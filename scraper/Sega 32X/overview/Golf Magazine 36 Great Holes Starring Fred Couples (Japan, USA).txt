As the title implies, in 36 Great Holes the player takes control of 24 different digitized golfers � 12 males and 12 females � playing in 27 historic courses in the U.S. including Disney's Eagle Pines and Tidewater Golf Club, playing 36 authentic holes.  

There are seven different modes (Stroke Play, Tournament, Skins, Shoot-out, Scramble, Practice and Match Play) and three different types of golf club heads including wood, metal and graphite. There is a battery back-up to keep track of 16 different categories of stats and does feature the voice of Fred Couples, even though he is not a playable character.
