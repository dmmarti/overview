Alphos is a basic vertically-scrolling shooter patterned after the 1982 Namco coin-op Xevious. Piloting the fighter craft Mnemonic, the player must fight back against the invading alien Alphos. Much like Namco's game, the player can shoot both air and ground targets separately, and there are many types of enemies and stationary targets in both planes. The game gives the player three lives and no continues, and can save high scores to disk.</Notes
