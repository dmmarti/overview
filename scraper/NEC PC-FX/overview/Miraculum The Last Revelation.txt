 In the world of Miraculum, there lived a powerful king named Siegwald. But his power was not enough for him, and he revived an ancient demon who had been sealed in a statue. But instead of granting him his power, the demon consumed the king's soul and possessed his body. He then swore to destroy humanity once and for all.****After several years, the fake Siegwald led his armies to conquer lands and to expand his empire. At that time, a warrior named Jay arrived at the port city of Heles. Now he must find loyal allies and eventually stop the Emperor's evil plans.****Miraculum: The Last Revelation plays like a traditional Japanese-style RPG, with a world map, towns and dungeons to visit, and enemies to defeat in random battles with turn-based combat. The setting is mostly medieval fantasy, but there are sci-fi elements as well. The player's party can use a variety of moves in battles, and it is also possible to set the characters on AI mode, only assigning them general strategies. Graphically the game resembles typical 16-bit Japanese RPGs, but it has some anime-style cut scenes, CD-quality music, and voice-overs for important conversations.
