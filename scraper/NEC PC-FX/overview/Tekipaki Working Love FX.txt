 Tekipaki: Working Love FX is essentially an upgraded version of  Tekipaki: Working Love for Turbo CD. It adds several scenarios to the main game, which play mostly like a Japanese-style adventure - the player can choose dialogue options or a location to go to. Those scenarios add more background to the personalities of Naomi, Hikaru, and Edalt, the three extra-terrestrial heroines of the game (for example, in one of the scenarios Hikaru's Martian cat escapes from the zoo, and it's the player's job to find him). The PC-FX version of the game also adds an "omake" option, where it is possible to view pictures of the girls.
