 Angelique Special is a remake of the original  Angelique for SNES. There are no changes gameplay-wise (a mixture of adventure, strategy, and "dating sim") or story-wise (a simple girl named Angelique Limoges must befriend nine Guardians to become a queen). The remake features better graphics, CD-quality music, voice acting, and anime-style cut-scenes.
