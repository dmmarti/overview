 Comic Road is a "life simulation" game, starring a young girl (whom the player names themselves) who dreams of becoming a manga artist. In order to become successful, she has to do more than just draw well; it is important to develop other aspects of her personality, and also keep an eye on the finances, otherwise working too much might deteriorate her drawing skills. Social life, physical exercises, reading - everything has consequences!****The gameplay consists mainly of making decisions (through menu choices); there is no player character navigation in the game, except shops, which are viewed from first-person perspective. There is a variety of ways to manage the girl's life. The player can make a schedule for a whole month, or decide every day what to do. Every action has an effect on the heroine's parameters. For example, just resting every day reduces physical shape and appeal. Working on the manga increases respective skills. It is possible to call friends and spend time with them, or go shopping. There are many items in the game, all of which influence the heroine's stats in that or another way - for example clothes, drawing accessories, books, or even a PC-FX console, that can be bought in an electronics store for about 20000 yen.
