 Tenchi Muyo! Ryo-oki FX includes  Tenchi Muyo! Ryo-oki with slightly better graphics (full-screen pictures instead of framed ones), and a whole new chapter, which is dedicated to officers of the Galaxy Police. The new chapter centers around the green-haired Hakua, who works for Mihoshi Kuramitsu, one of the game's main characters, and Detective Kiyone Makibi, Mihoshi's ex-partner.
