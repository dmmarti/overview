 The official mascot of the PC-FX console is now the star of her own game. Rolfee is a princess of a magical land which is threatened by demons. So Rolfee and her family - including a cute little animal called Nyai - move to Japan. Rolfee has to go to high school, and she hopes to study well and make friends. Will she have success in the school? Will she be liked by her classmates? Will she not quarrel too much with her family? It all depends on the player!****Tonari no Princess Rolfee is a Japanese-style adventure game with some mild simulation elements (Rolfee has parameters than can increase or decrease, depending on the player's actions). Most of the interaction consists of choosing which location to go to (through a menu command). A somewhat unusual feature of the game are its random events. Going to a certain location will trigger random appearances of characters, so there are no clear and secure ways to  make certain events happen. Triggering different events leads to different consequences in the story and different endings.
