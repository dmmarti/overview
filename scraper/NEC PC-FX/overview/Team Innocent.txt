 The events of the game are set in the future. The Galactic Police discovers that a scientist named Cronus has conducted genetic experiments on human beings. The police chief rescues three little girls, each one of whom bears the traces of these experiments. Fast-forward fifteen years: the three girls - Saki, Lilis, and Ariel - now work for the Galactic Police, determined to find out the truth about their origins and the nature of experiments. They are sent on three dangerous missions - missions they might not survive...****Team Innocent: The Point of No Return is an adventure game with action elements. The player controls each one of the three girls during the three missions. Each of the heroines must explore a large location, collecting items and solving puzzles on the way. The girls can also find and equip various weapons, from pistols to axes. The player can choose one of the three action modes for combat: melee attack, kicking, and shooting. The girls are navigated from third-person perspective  on pre-rendered backgrounds and constantly changing camera angles, much like in old  Resident Evil games, except for the girls being sprites and not 3D models. ****The game has many anime-style cut-scenes and voice-overs for all dialogues.
