 The fifth installment of the most famous strip mahjong series, which originated on the arcades. The player competes against three high-school girls, who take off their clothes when losing.****This is the only console version of Super Real Mahjong in which the girls undress completely. In the previous three games (on TurboGrafx CD) and later installments (mostly on the Saturn), the girls go only as far as underwear. The PC versions were, however, uncensored from the beginning.
