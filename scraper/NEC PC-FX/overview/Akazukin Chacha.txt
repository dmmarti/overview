 The game is based on the manga Akazukin Cha-Cha ("Red Riding Hood Cha-Cha") by Min Ayahana, and subsequently on the animated TV series that followed it. The manga tells the story of a little girl named Cha-Cha who lives with her teacher on a mountain and studies magic. In the anime, the story was expanded to include the villainous Demon King, whom Cha-Cha and her best friend Riiya, a werewolf boy, must eventually defeat.****Akazukin Cha-Cha: Osawagase! Panic Race! is a board game for up to six players. Each player corresponds to a character from the TV series. It is also possible to play just as Cha-Cha and to let the AI control the other characters. Each player advances on the board by throwing dice. Landing on different fields leads to different results: finding items, being attacked, etc. The game's strategy elements are expanded by giving each character unique statistics and abilities, that have to be used under special circumstances. Certain obstacles are only solvable if two or more characters gather on the same field. ****Taking a cue from  Battle Heat, "Akazukin Cha-Cha" accompanies every single move by an anime-style FMV.
