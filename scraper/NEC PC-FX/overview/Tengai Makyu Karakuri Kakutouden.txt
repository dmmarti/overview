 The ancient demon Yomi is about to be revived once again, and warriors all over the land of Jipang have gathered to stop him. But only the strongest of them can fight Yomi, after has has defeated all the others - because this story is but an excuse for fights between familiar characters from  Tengai Makyo universe!****This fighting game uses the same system as the previously released  Battle Heat: each and every move of the characters is displayed as an anime-style movie. The player presses appropriate buttons for offensive and defensive moves (also controlling the power of the move), after which an anime sequence is shown. In both versus mode (against computer opponent and two-players mode, it is possible to play as some of the most remarkable Tengai Makyo heroes (Ziria,  Manjimaru,   Kabuki, and others), as well as some of the villains - like the recurrent stupid monkey Mantou.
