 The hero of the game is in his space ship, on the way to his home planet. But the space ship crash-lands on the Earth. The hero is on an important intergalactic mission and has to be on his home planet no later than in one month. He tries to figure out what caused the crash, and discovers that it was a voice that interfered with the ship's radio waves. Suddenly, three anime girls appear in front of him. They are Citron, Jasmine, and Cinnamon, the heroines of a TV anime series called "Elfin Triangle". They explain that the voice that caused the disturbance was that of a famous Japanese voice actress.... they just don't know which one. To get a sample of this voice would be the only hope to repair the ship... so the hero and his three lovely companions have to find out who the voice belongs to!****Voice Paradise plays, for the most part, like an adventure game with an internal schedule. A visit to every locations costs one game day, and the hero has only 30 days to find the voice actress. The locations include TV studio, CD shop, and other locations that have anything to do with anime and voice acting. The game contains plenty of material about Japanese voice actresses, so it can be described as educational. In order to successfully locate the actress, it is necessary to gather as much information as possible and take part in quiz that would narrow down the search and bring the hero nearer to the goal.
