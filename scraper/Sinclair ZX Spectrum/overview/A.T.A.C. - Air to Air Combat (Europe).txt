 This arcade style shooter is a breath of fresh air after the previous batch of games. This ones only going to sustain you for a few minutes before you decide to move on but its not too bad and a fun addition to the Vega. Movement is Defender style, allowing you to move left or right in your massive chopper. It takes you quite a while to change direction but strangely your bullets start shooting in the new direction faster than your helicopter can turn around. Physically that can't be possible but it makes the game a lot easier - waiting for the helicopter to turn before you could shoot in that direction would be pretty frustrating if you had to wait. The main difference from your Defender style game is that you are constantly dropping to the earth, so you have to fight against that gravity pull. It add something to the game because it would be a little bit too vanilla without it.
