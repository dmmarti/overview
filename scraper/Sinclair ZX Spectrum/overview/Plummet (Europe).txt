	The Mayor of New York has gone to open the city's latest skyscraper, but has got stuck in the malfunctioning lift. As a Superhero for hire, you must climb the building using the stairs, and bring enough ropes to be able to tie the lift up and winch it down safely.    The levels of the building are portrayed across 3 screens, scrolling vertically. You must pick up one of the many ropes which are located throughout the floors, take it up to the top of the shaft on the third screen, then collect another and do the same.    You'll have to suspend your disbelief a little with regard to the hazards stopping you doing this - security men who must be shot (why aren't they on your side?) (you can only shoot while in possession of a rope, by the way); falling bits of ceiling on the top screen (rather shoddy building?); and fire doors which are fatal to the touch unless you shoot them open.
