	Kai Temple is a simple platform game. The player is trapped inside the temple and must escape. Their only weapons are a dagger and a lethal kick!    The player has just four chances to escape before it's game over. Guards at the temple fall into two categories; Divas, who can be defeated with the dagger, and Ninjas who will only succumb to close combat.    The player must also ring a bell whenever they come across one.    To make things a little tougher, the game screen also has a tendency to flip upside down without warning, usually disorienting the player at a vital moment!
