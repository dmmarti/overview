	A theme park may not seem like a typical platform game setting, compared to standards such as magical islands, abandoned castles and dank underground complexes. Elite's interpretation of setting a game there involves running and jumping through the complex to collect abandoned money.    The park features 60 screens, which are arranged in a non-linear way. They feature standard theme park attractions such as log flumes, big wheels and bumper cars. All of these can be jumped onto as they move, and can take you through the screens, either to get onto the next one quickly, or to help reach the awkwardly-placed money. You start with 10 lives, which can be lost through falling too far, or landing on water or fire hazards.
