	Run Baby Run is unusual among games of this vintage in that it sets you as the 'bad' guy - in this case a getaway driver attempting to flee the scene of a robbery. Six police cars will immediately give chase, and your task is to block them off so as to cause them to collide with each other.     A seventh car is on guard at the entrance (the bottom left of the screen) and this will chase you, armed with a rocket launcher, once all 6 other cars have crashed. You must reach the southern wall without being hit to complete the level.     There are five of these, with the cars becoming faster as you progress. 8 speed levels are available, with more points available on the faster ones.
