Your land has been invaded by the evil Kremins and with their magic turned all your friends and family into birds and mice. You also have been turned into a bird but luckily the transformation wasn't complete and you kept your brain. You have decided that you are the only one who can defeat the Kremins and break the spell. In this arcade-like platform game you have to explore their huge flick-screen domain looking for the serum to turn you into a human. A wizard also needs finding to strengthen your weakened heart before collecting four pieces of a nuclear fuel to place in the reactor room to blow the domain up, destroy all Kremins and break the spell. As you fly around the domains screens you will encounter various creatures with some draining your health shown at the bottom of the screen as a bird turning into a skeleton. These need to be avoided but you can find a boomerang to kill them. Drain all your energy and it is game over but you can find items to increase your energy as well as pills to keep your heart going as flying around strains it. Resting helps your heart but you are open to be touched by the creatures. Traps need to be looked out for like closing gates and fires and one touch means it is game over.
