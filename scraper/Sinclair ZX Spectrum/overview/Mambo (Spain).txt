	Mambo, the most intrepid secret agent of the galaxy, has to fulfill a dangerous mission- entering into an enemy base The base is filled with crazy guardians who wouldn't hesitate in shooting against the smallest movement or launching missiles that could constitute a serious danger for humanity. They are not the kind of people anyone would allow to run freely through the streets.    Once inside the camp, the first action will consist in cornering the four captains, to snatch each of their codified cards. Simultaneously, it's necessary to find two security computers- one opens the door of the subterranean base and the other allows access to the control room. Finally, you should arrive at this room and activate the missiles with the cards. You will then need to leave the base.
