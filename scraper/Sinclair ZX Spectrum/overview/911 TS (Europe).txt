Like the similarly-named C64 game, this driving game puts you in control of a Dunlop-shod Porsche 911. The player must battle through 8 top-view stages packed with obstacles, within a time limit - any remaining time is converted into points. Contact with obstacles (including trees, bicycles and a chasing car) causes damage to accumulate; once this reaches maximum the game is over.     Before the game starts you can upgrade your car; with ï¾£2000 to spend you must choose one (or none) of each of the four categories - tyres, fuel, boost, and handling upgrades such as power-steering and improved brakes. Through trial-and-error you will learn which combinations suit your driving style and the ensuing hazards the most. Further upgrades can be collected on the odd-numbered stages, by driving over them.
