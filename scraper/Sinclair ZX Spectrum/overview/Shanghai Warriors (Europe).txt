	Shanghai Warriors is a side-scrolling fighting game featuring three levels- an airport, a military base, and a harbor. The main character can jump, punch, and kick, just like the enemies. While the kick has a slightly longer range, the punch is a little faster. To gain an advantage over the enemies, it is possible to pick up various weapons including a machine-gun, throwing knives, or shurikens. Ammunition for all weapons is limited. Unlike many similar fighting games, there are no end-of-level bosses in the game.
