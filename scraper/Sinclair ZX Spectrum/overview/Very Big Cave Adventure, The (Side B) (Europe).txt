	Essentially a graphical version of Colossal Cave, The Very Big Cave Adventure has the player navigating around a forest, collecting treasures and dealing with strange creatures. It involves reading a description of each scene, then typing in one- or two-word commands to perform an action, with some of them providing some humor to the player. Directions can be abbreviated as N, E, S, W.
