	Due to an accident involving Professor Flipnoodles' Pocket Rocket (would you trust a scientist called Flipnoodles? I certainly wouldn't, especially as mad scientists cause so many computer game plot disasters) the Hanna Barbera characters have been hurtled into space. The Lilli-Punies have kidnapped them, and will only let them free if they can rescue their missing compatriots.    The search starts on the surface of the planet, but also takes Ruff underground into the cavernous regions the Lilli-Punies live in. These have lots of water, which Ruff must avoid. Plenty of extra lives can be collected along the way, with solving puzzles as important as good reactions and dexterity.
