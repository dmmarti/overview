	This is an arcade action maze game. You control a Miracloid droid around a 400-room map, avoiding 20 types of enemy whilst collecting 10 jewel-shaped "qigit" objects. Each "qigit" must be dropped onto an associated dock, somewhere else on the map. Controls are left/right/thrust/jump/fire (similar to JetPac). There are power-ups etc. in some rooms.     Gameplay is mainly about exploration, with some quick reactions called for when enemies spawn in tricky situations. You can only hold 3 objects at any one time, so a certain amount of swapping and dropping objects is required. The game intro featured some 1-bit sampled speech.
