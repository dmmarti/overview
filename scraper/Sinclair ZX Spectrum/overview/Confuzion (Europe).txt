	This is a puzzle game where you must explode all of the bombs on each level, using a spark.  The spark flows along a fuse, which is made up of a series of tiles.  These can be moved, in the manner of sliding puzzles, where there is only one gap, and tiles can be moved into the gap, creating a new gap.  The aim is then to move the tiles so the fuse forms a path from the spark to each bomb.     There is a time limit, however, and extra time is knocked off if the spark reaches a dead end.  Also some levels contain water droplets, that extinguish the spark if they touch it.
