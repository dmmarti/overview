This is the fifth game in Artic's Adventure Series . The player takes the role of an adventurer who is on a quest to fond the legendary Golden Apple, whilst also hunting down 13 other treasures. There are 3 main areas to explore - a large mansion, a ship and a mountainous island.    The interface is purely text driven, with no illustrations of the room you are in. The text is in different colours and on a black background, unlike the first few in the series which used the system default black text on a grey background.
