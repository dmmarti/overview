	Shadow Warriors is a direct port of the arcade version of Ninja Gaiden. It is a beat'em up in the veins of Double Dragon featuring Ryu Hayabusa, a ninja who must fight members of an evil cult who seek to fulfil Nostradamus' end of the world prophecies.    Ryu Hayabusa can attack his enemies using his his bare hands and feet or using a sword (for a limited time). He can also perform moves such as a flying neck throw, a back flip and hang kicks, performed while hanging in scenario objects. Throwing enemies against objects such as phone cabins, oil drums or dumpsters will destroy them, revealing power ups such as health items and swords. At some points, Ryu will have to perform acrobatic moves to carry on. He has a life bar starting with 5 units.    The game takes place in United States' locations such as Las Vegas, North Carolina, Los Angeles, the Grand Canyon and Brooklyn. The enemies in those stages are mostly of the same 5 kinds, including Jason Vorhees' look-alikes and other masked men. There is a boss fight at the end of each stage.    A two-player co-operative game is also featured. Whenever the player dies, a continue screen will appear showing Ryu chained to a table while a circular saw descends upon him.
