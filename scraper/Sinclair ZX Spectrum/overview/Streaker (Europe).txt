	You are a streaker with not a stitch on you, in the streets. As you go from room to room you must try and collect as much of your clothing as possible; the more clothes you find the more areas of the game you can go to. You can pick items up such as food to keep your energy up; some shops will only open at different times to make things difficult. Be quick to find your clothes or they can get pinched.
