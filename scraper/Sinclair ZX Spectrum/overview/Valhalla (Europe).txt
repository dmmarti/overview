Living in the Norse God's home of Valhalla, you are on the bottom of the social scale. To move up this scale you have decided to attempt six quests, which involves searching and finding six magical objects, Ofnir, Drapnir, Skornir, Skalir, Felstrong and Grimnir. You must explore the lands to find or buy objects needed like swords and helmets (you can only have one of each), interact with the other inhabitants (by talking or helping them) to join you on your quest or give you items they own, and keep eating and drinking to keep your strength up. Once you find a magical object you must deposit it as you can only carry so many items, some objects can't be carried together, and if you die you go to Hell and any objects you have are lost and appear in the game in a new location. Although Valhalla is a graphic text adventure where you type commands to control your player and game, it also has elements of a real time game. The inhabitants go about their business without interaction from you. Their eat food, order other inhabitants to do things and even fight each other. The screen is divided into three, the top part is flick-screen where you watch the inhabitants going about their business, the middle part is text describing what is happening and the bottom part is where you type your commands.
