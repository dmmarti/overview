Things have got very strange in Cricklewood. After a great evening at the dinner and presentation night at The Liars Club where people come to tell the biggest stories, an Irishman with red hair has won the Cup. At the end of the night as you are leaving you stumble on the body of the Irishman who looks like he has been bitten and clawed to death. Barely alive the Irishman tells you that a LION has attacked him and stolen the Cup and for his final wish could you get the Cup back. Your task is now to search the surrounding lands, avoiding the wild animals and find the Cup. The Cup is a text only adventure with each screen describing your location as you type in your commands.
