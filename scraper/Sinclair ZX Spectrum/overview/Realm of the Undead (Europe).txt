	An arcade adventure, the action in Realm Of The Undead takes place over three stages.    In the first stage, the player finds himself in the gardens of the Dark Lord's (Dracula's) domain, carrying three cloves of garlic. The player is advised to explore to collect more garlic, whilst avoiding the tarantulas that roam through the garden. Finding the secret exit will progress the player to the next stage.    In the second stage, the player explores the castle dungeons, avoiding vampire bats and more tarantulas, freeing trapped villagers whilst looking for the mystical entrance that will transport the player to the third and final stage of the game.    In the last stage, the player must explore the zombie-infested area around Dracula's own coffin to find the hammer and stake necessary to rid the land of the Dark Lord's menace. Moving into various areas will awaken Dracula to your presence, however, and send him in search of your blood. Three bites from the Dark Lord and you're sent back to stage one to start over again.
