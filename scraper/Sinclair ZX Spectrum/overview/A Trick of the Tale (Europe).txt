 A Trick of the Tale is a platformer of the Manic Miner variant: the player character must collect all music notes in the single-screen levels in order to open up the exit to the next level. Of course there are various stationary and moving (on fixed paths) obstacles which need to be avoided by jumping and sensible navigation of the platforms. Every touch means instant death and retracts one of the nine lives.  The game has no story and each of the 15 levels has a different theme (e.g. a forest, an asylum or a volcano).
