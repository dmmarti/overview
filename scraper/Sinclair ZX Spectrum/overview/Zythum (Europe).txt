	The Zythum is a magical drink, which, when imbibed, generates unknown powers. It lies hidden in the depths of a forbidding castle, which can only be reached by crossing four extremely hostile territories, each of which is guarded by custodians who must never be allowed to touch you.    You have 8 minutes to cross each land. If this time runs out, you will have failed in your quest and the game will end. If a custodian gets you, you will lose one of your 3 lives.
