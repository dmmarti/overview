Animated Strip Poker is a version of the game Strip Poker where you play Five-Card Stud against a woman to try to get her naked by winning hands to make her remove clothing. On the screen you can see your current hand of cards, the woman and a small character in the shape of a card who tells you the next part of the game. Both you and the woman start with ﾣ145 and ﾣ10 in the pot and you must raise, call or bet money on how you feel your hand of five cards will do against hers. Once the betting has been completed, you remove any cards you don't need and receive the same amount of cards. Betting once again takes place until a player calls and you both show your cards. The player with the better hand like pairs, two pairs, full house etc., wins the money and the other player removes a piece of clothing.
