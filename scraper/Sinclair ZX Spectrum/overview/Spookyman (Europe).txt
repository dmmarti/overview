	Spookyman is a Pac Man clone  for 1 or 2 players.    The game consists of a maze around which the player maneuvers a sprite that looks like a chomping banana. Also in the maze are four different coloured ghosts that must be avoided, and standard spots, power-up spots and a special red spot all of which need to be chomped.   The game screen also displays, current score, best score, number of lives left and a countdown timer.
