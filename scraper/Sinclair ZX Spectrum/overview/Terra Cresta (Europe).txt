	The high-tech Terra Cresta ship should be capable of wiping out alien forces on a disputed planet. You're the pilot, and must shoot out every ship, defence tower and minefield you find as you fly around its surface.     The action is viewed from above, scrolling only at the top, leaving you with a set journey to follow. You are limited to 2 bullets on screen at a time, so each shot should be tactically considered.    Power-ups are released by numbered buildings - shoot the building and then fly immediately in front of it to collect them. Once you have a a power-up Formation Mode, which gives you multiple firing positions as the ship splits of itself, is an option.
