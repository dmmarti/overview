	You're Caliph - king of Iraq. An evil wizard from distant land broke into your palace, transforming it into a maze of traps and puzzles, and taking the sacred Sceptre of Bagdad. Unless you can recover it, your spell as ruler is finished.    Featuring lots of enemies to dodge, platform-style jumps and object manipulation, the game resembles the Dizzy games, with a Jet Set Willy-influenced setting. There are many objects you need to use, but you can only carry two at a time. You have 3 lives with which to complete the game.
