	This was the first in Lothlorien's Warmaster series of Strategy wargames and re-creates the epic battle in 1815 when Napoleon met his final defeat at the hands of a combined British, Dutch and Prussian army at Waterloo.    In the game, you command Napoleon's forces against the combined Anglo-Dutch army of Wellington (controlled by the computer). The computer also controls the Prussian forces, which arrive at a later phase of the game. Your objective is to rout the Anglo-Dutch army at Waterloo, while leaving enough men to deal with the Prussian threat coming from Ligny.     Infantry and cavalry units are available for both sides (no artillery), each with varying degrees of strength and morale. Terrain effects play an important role in the effectiveness of units - the Anglo-Dutch forces, for example, occupy ridges and farmhouses which increase their defensive capabilities.
