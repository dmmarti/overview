	In Paws you play a cat whose ten kittens have wandered off. With Bull Dog Billy and his Bully gang on the loose, this is a situation no responsible mother could allow. In this Atic Atac-style arcade adventure, you must move through the screens rescuing your kittens (carrying one at a time) and bringing them back to your home.    The game screens include a built-up city (with the barriers drawn as imitations of common high street UK brands of the time, including Lloyds Bank and John Menzies), a forest, and a run-down inner city with litter. The dogs are on the prowl - shoot them using your yarn balls. Ammunition and food can be collected. If you take too long dealing with the dogs, they will form into a pack, which means Game Over. Other than that, you have nine lives.
