The war on the Seiddab rages on, and you now take part in an attack on their moon base. You fly a hovercraft a bit above the moon's surface, and must shoot down the enemy's DAB tanks. After that ring of defense is penetrated, you must dodge your way through a space minefield above a mountain range, and then a missile firing range before reach the Seiddab's command base.     Unlike its predecessor, 3D Seiddab Attack, you are now flying, and can make more adventurous maneuvers.
