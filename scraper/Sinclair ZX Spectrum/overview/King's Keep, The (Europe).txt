	The King's Keep is a graphical arcade adventure. The player is imprisoned inside a castle keep belonging to their father, King Harold the Heartless.    The aim is to escape the confines of the Keep by talking to other characters and collecting and swapping objects.    Interaction is achieved by pressing fire and selecting options from a pop-up menu. Many of the other characters have mini-quests that will ultimately allow you to leave the keep via the drawbridge.
