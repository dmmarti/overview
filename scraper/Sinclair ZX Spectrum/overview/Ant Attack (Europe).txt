An early isometric game that predates Ultimate's classic Knight Lore by a year. Used what it called the "softsolid 3d" algorithm to represent a large scrolling city from a switchable isometric perspective. The city, identified in the inlay blurb as Antescher, a combination of Ant and Escher, the famous visual paradox artist, is teeming with deadly giant ants. The player controls a boy or a girl and races around the city trying to find his/her lost half while jumping on structures to avoid the ants, or fighting the insects by either jumping on them or throwing grenades.    Ant Attack, like most games of its time, was created almost solely by a single programmer, who also designed the graphics and sound. This game had a unique visual appeal in a time before isometric action-adventures became all the rage.
