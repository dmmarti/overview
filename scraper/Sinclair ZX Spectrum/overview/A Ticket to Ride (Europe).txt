	The Federation has decided to abandon its outpost of Selexia, leaving its inhabitants with 24 hours to get out. To do this, they will need a ticket, documents confirming their identity and right to resettle, and 2048 credits (why not 2000? Why does the future always go through powers of 2 instead of 10 in science-fiction? A measure of the extent to which computers will take over?). Needless to say, obtaining those objects is your task.    Movement is controlled by pushing the joystick left and right, with up and down used to turn around at the end of roads (similarly to Tir Na Nog or Turbo Esprit). Other controls are selected using an icon system however, which is accessed by pressing fire. In total there are 16 icons, including inventory access, shop usage, object manipulation and game saving/restarting.
