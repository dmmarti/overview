 Alien Research Centre is a graphical text adventure. The player is a spacer, specifically he's a hard-up spacer, who gets a call from Brogan. Brogan's not hard up, he's rich, he owns a space ship, the Alien Research Centre or A.R.C., and Brogan has a problem.  One of the A.R.C.'s crew got high on drugs and not only did they sabotage the ship they released a number of deadly creatures. The crew are probably all dead but the ship is still intact and worth a lot of money. Your job is to board her, repair her, reach the bridge and activate the E.H.D. (Emergency Homing Device)   Armed only with a decimator cannon, and anything else they come across, the player must explore the ship, repair it, and return to Earth to collect their bonus.
