 Quite imaginative the idea for this game. The base idea is to survive a nuclear holocaust. First gather up the essentials, water, food, a radio, then apparently hiding in a shelter located under the house waiting for the attack. After the nuclear attack you can choose to come to the outside, where we again collect water, food, etc., while being chased by other survivors. Of course the game is crap, is poorly programmed, the graphics are horrible, and the sound is obnoxious. It's playable for a few rounds, until it becomes boring. But the implied sarcasm concerning the cold war politics and nuclear threat, and in particular Mrs.Thatcher and R. Reagan is worthy of attention. Funny to read the 2 magazine reviews made at the time of the games release, one even states suspicion that level 1 is on purpose unfinishable so that you have to read that infamous phrase about the politicians mentioned above.
