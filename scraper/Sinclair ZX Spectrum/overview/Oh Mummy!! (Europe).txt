	The pyramids of ancient Egypt are known to be full of treasure, but it will take a brave man to uncover them, as the spirits have sent guardians to protect them.    In this game you play an archaeologist, and mummies are after you. You have to run through a matrix (inside a pyramid), and make sure you unveil every treasure by walking around all 4 sides of each square. It's presented in a 2D top down view.
