	Plotting involves several different types of blocks, bearing symbols such as squares, circles and crosses. Using a small yellow object to direct a block across onto a particular section of a shaped wall. It will then rebound onto a set of blocks at a particular angle, with the intention of removing similar blocks it touches. This is done against a time limit, and there are special blocks to help out with extra lives.    Converted from a Taito coin-op.
