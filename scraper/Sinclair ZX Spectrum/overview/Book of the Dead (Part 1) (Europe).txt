Life in the Other World was blissful for you, Kteth, a falcon headed Egyptian Godling, and your brothers and other Gods until your Father, Set decided to murder the great God Osiris to take his place. Osiris' son Horus though rose up and defeated your Father and threw him out of the Other World, while his relatives including you are banished to become mortal and live amongst men. As you are innocent in all this some Gods have decided to help you and so tell you about a nearly forgotten manuscript called the Book of the Dead. It describes how a mortal soul can travel after dieing, to the Other World, and is written in tomes, appears on tomb walls and is in the minds of some priests and beings. Horus has heard about the book and so has put a curse on yourself which gives you a crippling disease which will kill you long before you find all the text and undergo the rites of purification to get your soul back to being a Godling. As well as the book you have to find Gods who will help you by giving you a cure. Book of the Dead is a graphic text adventure where the screen has text describing your location while a picture shows you what you can see. You type in commands with the keyboard to interact with your surroundings and other people or Gods.
