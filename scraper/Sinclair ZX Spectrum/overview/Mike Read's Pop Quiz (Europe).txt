	BBC Radio 1 DJ Mike Read presented a pop music quiz show, which is recreated here with questions from the 50s to the 80s. You can play against the computer or another human; either way, select a specialist subject and 2 team-mate graphics (all representing white people). The overall style and presentation are very similar to Elite's earlier A Question of Sport license.    In the first round you select one of twelve random questions from the Jukebox, each of which has four options. A correct answer earns you two points, while an incorrect answer gives your opponent the chance to steal for one point. In round 2 you get three clues to name a star - you get three points for guessing from one clue, two points from two, and one point if you need all 3. In round three, choose an Easy question (from your category) for one point, or a Hard one (from someone else's) for two.    Round four asks you to Guess The Year that a set of events happened in, with scoring the same as round 2. Then comes the quickfire round - answer up to nine questions in 45 seconds, with a 2-second penalty for an incorrect answer. Finally, the six remaining Jukebox pictures are revealed and answered.
