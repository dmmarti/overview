	The World Government has taken the decision to wipe out the Abraxas Corporation, a weaponry-dealing regime that has helped dictators and terrorists for decades. As a member of the elite Silent But Deadly force, you have been sent in to destroy their plastic island, most importantly their 10 reactors. The twist is that you are expected to do this on board a rickety hang-glider.    Everything on the island must be bombed using your grenades, but the most efficient method of travel is to hug the ground and stay low, so a balance must be found to be in the sky at the right times. Each reactor is protected by lasers, although by running into the nearest control tower these can be sent haywire for long enough to allow you to jump in and destroy them.
