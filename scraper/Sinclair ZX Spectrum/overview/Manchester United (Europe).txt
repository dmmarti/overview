	A football management simulation with an arcade component where you manage the world's most famous football team. Lead them through a season to see how many trophies you can win. You can pick your dream team for the positions you want and see how they do in the championships.    The management side lets you choose and configure your team, choosing training schedules to develop your players and viewing their skills.    The arcade side can be used purely as a hands off simulation, or as a way to have a direct effect on the result.
