	You have been trapped in a vortex by the Gods of Zzam. To escape you must bring them their crystals, which are buried within 16 chambers.These each contain 3 effigies, which must be collected to allow you to transport onto new levels and gain extra powers to allow you to track down the crystals within that chamber.    You can thrust upwards using a jet propulsion pack, but this is limited in energy.The minions of the Gods must be avoided, as contact with them causes you to lose irreplaceable effigies and thus lose a 'life'. To activate the special powers, and find out what they do, a Spellbound-style menu system is activated by pressing fire.
