Voyage to Atlantis is a treasure hunting text adventure in which the player explores the lost city of Atlantis. In conventional fashion the player starts in a location with a sign that all treasures should be dropped there and the player can move from there to explore his surroundings, pick up items and solve simple puzzles. There are some hostile marine animals that have to be defeated as well as a maze. The game can also be saved into a single save-slot.
