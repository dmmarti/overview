	Rather than attempting to simulate the whole of football, this title concentrated on the goalkeeper's task of saving shots. In each match you will face a succession of shots from different distances and angles, and aim to save as many as possible. 16 teams were included for you to select your team and opposition from. There's a practice mode, and a skill challenge, where you move up through the game by saving 4 successive shots. The C64 version has a little sampled speech and extra sound.
