 Airbase Invader is a 2D top-down shooter game. The player controls Annie, a girl with a peace sign flag, who must stop President Raygun before he hits red nuclear button. Annie must find Raygun in maze - she fights against various soldiers. She uses small hearts as weapons - but she can shoot horizontally only. Game has little jokes - one of enemies is Iron Lady (a.k.a. Margaret Thatcher), etc
