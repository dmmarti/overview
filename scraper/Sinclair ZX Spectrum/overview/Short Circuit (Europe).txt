	A freak bolt of lightning has made Robot 5 gain human feelings, and his makers at Nova Robotics are keen to open him up and find out how this happened. 5 therefore feels desperate to escape, and survive in the wider world.    The game is split into two parts, which differ from the Commodore 64 game of the same name, and can each be played independently. The first is viewed in third-person 3D, as our hero moves from room to room through various doors. Objects can be picked up to allow him to jump and fire. You can use objects in your possession, take them by searching desks, or link to some of the available computers to use their functionality.    In the second stage, armed with jumping and shooting abilities, Number 5 must simply escape as quickly as he can. Guards and Other robots are giving chase, and should be shot. Your robot becomes increasingly depressed when he kills wildlife, and this can eventually cost you a life, so make sure you jump or duck around them.
