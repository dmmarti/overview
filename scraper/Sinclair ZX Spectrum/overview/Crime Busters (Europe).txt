In Crime Busters, you play a law breaking geezer who goes by the name of Bennie the Burglar. He's a burglar don't you know (the surname and Zoro mask are a dead give away) and so we first meet him breaking into people's houses and bagging stuff that was considered luxury in the eighties like tacky pictures from Boyes and coat racks. Be careful though. Not all is what it seems in this neighbourhood.
