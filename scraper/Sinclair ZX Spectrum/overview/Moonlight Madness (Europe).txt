	Your scout duty takes you into the heavily booby-trapped home of an eccentric old professor, who suddenly collapses. His pills are locked in a safe at the other side of the building. It's your job to fetch them, and save the old man's life.    Gameplay is similar to Jet Set Willy, with each screen requiring a pre-planned path to cross it, and lots of doors to open. Falls will cost you a life, even if you land on something flat.
