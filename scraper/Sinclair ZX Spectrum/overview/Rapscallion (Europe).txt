	Rapscallion the Rogue has captured the ownership rights to your castle, and imprisoned you out in the wilderness. Fortunately, your friend the Princess has transformed you into a bird, allowing you to escape and begin your quest for vengeance in this arcade adventure.    The screens are linked in a maze fashion, with most having multiple exits, and each has its own hazards. These include marauding cats, dual spikes that close in on you, bolts of electricity fired out from linked points, spiders, and loads more. The graphical style is large and blocky, and certainly out of the ordinary. You can change between a fly and a bird, each of which is immune to some hazards. When you lose a life, you change into a ghost, which can fly around unimpeded, but can,t do anything productive, so your first task is to find a pixie and change back.
