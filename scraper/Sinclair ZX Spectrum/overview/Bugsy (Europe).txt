You are Bugsy, a giant rabbit whose ambition it is to be Public Enemy No.1 in the city of Chicago in place of Al Capone. Starting with nothing, you have to work your way up the pecking order by any means necessary including theft, extortion, murder, bribery and other illegal means. The game is a graphic text adventure where you read text describing your location while a picture shows what you are looking at. You type in commands with the keyboard to interact with each location. If you interact with someone you have various options like insult, bribe and protect.
