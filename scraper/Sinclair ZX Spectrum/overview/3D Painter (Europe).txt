 3D Painter is a maze game similar to the arcades respectively either aesthetically or gameplay-wise to Make Trax (Alpha Denshi, 1981) and Pac-Man (Namco, 1981).  The player has to course the entire maze just like Pac-Man has to "eat" every dot present on the screen. The same principle is also applied in Make Trax where the player has to "paint" the entire path of the maze, except in 3D Painter the player is not represented as a paintbrush but as the painter himself. Only then he can advance to the next stage. There are 4 different possible mazes and each time their whole set is completed the speed of the game will increasingly rise up.  Besides the player, a dangerous berserker is also present on every maze. A single contact with him and the game is over.
