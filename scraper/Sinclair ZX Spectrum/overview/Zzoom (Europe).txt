	Protecting refugees is your main aim here, although initially the blood-curdling screams if you shoot them can be more satisfying. You are flying a Ground Skimmer, complete with advanced flight computer.    The game is viewed in 3D, with you flying into a scrolling screen, which was quite a technical advance at the time. Enemies come at your from all angles and must be shot down before they can reach the refugees. You must make sure not to hit the ground or make contact with the enemies, as this will gradually weaken your shield.
