This is the seventh game in Artic's Adventure Series. You play the role of a regular Joe living in the present, who wakes to find that the world is on the brink of all out nuclear war by a TV announcement.    The gameplay involves trying to find a way to survive this oncoming apocalypse by using ordinary items found around the house and garden, and to turn your house into a makeshift fallout shelter.    The game is authored with the Quill Adventure System and is more like the first games in the series in that it is purely text based unlike its predecessor Eye of Bain which had graphical illustrations of the rooms you are in. The game accepts the simple verb/noun commands.
