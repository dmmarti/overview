 Magic Isle is a single player, fantasy text adventure which completes the story that was started in A Legacy For Alaric.  In the previous game the player took the role of a young lad who's a member of The Adventurer's Guild. It seems that the wizard Emril is dying of old age and wants to pass on his legacy to his nephew Alaric. The problem is that Alaric is being held prisoner in an island castle on lake Moira. This game picks up the story as the player lands on the island where the castle is now controlled by dwarves. The task remains the same, find Alaric and get him to safety.
