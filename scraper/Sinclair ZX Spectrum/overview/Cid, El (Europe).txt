	This is a fictitious adventure protagonized by "el Cid Campeador", a Castilian hero who contributed magnificently to the Spanish "Reconquista" (the re-conquest of the Hispanic territories which were invaded by Moors, time period which starts on 722 and ends on 1492 with the taking of the last Hispanic territory, Granada).    But talking about the game, we are on the XI century, a dark time full of incessant fights between the the good and the evil. A legend whose antiquity was lost in the abyss of the times, assured the existence a parchment that, with being read by the evil forces, would trigger such big wave of disasters that Satan would be able to seize the Earth and assure its dominion as prince of the darkness.     Our audacious protagonist, when knowing the legend of the parchment, was decided to recover it for the forces of the good, since the legend also affirmed that if this document would be read by two persons of good intentions, their effects would be annulled for ever.     With this objective in mind, he began to search the magical key, that released the spell that had hidden the parchment. But the task was not going to be simple, like him, many horsemen had decided to find the parchment, some with glory anxieties and others by less worthy reasons. Luckily for Rodrigo (el Cid), the many years of fight against the Moors had fortified their noble arm, reason why the combats by sword are no secret for him.
