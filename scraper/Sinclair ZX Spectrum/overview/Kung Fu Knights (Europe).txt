	This martial arts simulation features large and detailed characters drawn in line form. In the one player game you have 3 lives, losing one every time your opponent defeats you in a fight, and your target is to reach the black belt status and then defend it repeatedly. As well as launching attacking moves, you must be able to back away to avoid taking hits yourself. Once you hit your opponent (knocking off a Yin-Yang symbol) he becomes weaker for the next few seconds, and thus easier to knock down again. A slow motion action replay is built in.
