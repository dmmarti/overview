 3D-Quadracube is a three dimensional Tic-tac-toe game that can be played by two players or one player against the computer. The game is played on a 4x4x4 cube that has been cut up into four slices that are drawn isometrically. The aim is to get a line of four and it can be vertical, diagonal or horizontal through the cube or on any of the slices. The game is played with the keyboard and for each move the player enters the number of the slice, the row and the column. After a completed game the winner can get a high score based on the number of moves needed.
