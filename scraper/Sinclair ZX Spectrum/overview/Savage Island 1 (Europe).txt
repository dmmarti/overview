Savage Island is the only multi-part game in Scott Adams' adventure series, all of which have a very similar parser and interface. At the completion of this game, players receive a password which allows part two to be played. The Savage Island games are also probably the most difficult adventures in the series! The player begins trapped on a small remote island in the ocean, which is facing a hurricane and also has an active volcano. The player can cross a river, and will also need to explore a cave network. Items are often found by running through the sand with one's hands. The island holds a great secret, which will not be discovered until both parts of the game have been completed.
