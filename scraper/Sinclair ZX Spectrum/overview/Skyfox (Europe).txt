	Aliens have invaded your beloved homeland, and you must help save it. You are flying the Skyfox, the most advanced attack fighter plane available to the Federation, from within the cockpit. Skyfox is complete with deflection shields, laser cannons, five guided and five heat-seeking missiles and a top speed of Mach IV.  The 15 scenarios can be played at 5 skill levels. You will have to fight tanks, enemy planes and the mothership.  Use the radar to locate enemy vehicles, and the long-range scanner to ensure that no wave reaches your base before you can take it out. Keep an eye on your shields, and on fuel levels - you can dock at the base to refuel.
