	Walter Wall must decorate a 101-room mansion, by running through most of the squares it is divided into. Matt Gloss is trying to stop him - in some of these rooms he can kill him in contact, in others he can run over existing paint and absorb it. Wall is armed with paste, which he can drop - for a few seconds it presents a barrier which Gloss can't cross. The rooms are intricately-shaped, with lots of corridors and junctions. Several imitate real objects - the dining room is shaped like a fork (with dead-end corridors you can get trapped into by gloss) for example. Each level must be completed within a fifty-second time limit - running out costs one of your ten lives.
