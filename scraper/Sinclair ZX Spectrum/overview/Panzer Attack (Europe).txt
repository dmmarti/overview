	Panzer Attack is a computerised wargame similar to the board-game Risk, representing World War II's crucial Battle of the Bulge. The player represents General Hodges, a commander of the US forces, while the computer always plays the German side. The gameplay is turn-based - you move all your tanks using map references, then the computer does the same.    You have to try to protect your fuel dumps against the Germans. The difficulty can be determined by setting how many German divisions are attacking - the default is 200. Intelligence advice you receive is not always accurate, so pay attention to what you can see on the map.
