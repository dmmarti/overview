	Riding an Ostrich, you must do battle with buzzard-mounted knights. Rather than shooting at them or fighting hand-to-hand, the combat is resolved simply - you must be above the buzzard to defeat it, otherwise you lose one of your five lives. There are ledges in the landscape, to increase the strategic nature of finding a winning position. Each scene contains a set number of knights to be vanquished - lose a life and you must restart the screen. Four types of opposition are faced, increasing in speed and skill - Blue Bearers, Green Chasers, Red Knaves and Dark Knights.
