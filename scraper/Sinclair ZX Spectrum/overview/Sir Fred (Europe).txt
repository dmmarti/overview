	The whistle of the leaves with the wind of the forest is brutally interrupted by the appearance of a solitary figure between the branches of the shrubs. The sharping air of the North threat with tearing the clothes of the great horseman, "Sir Fred".  His rabid preoccupation for the kidnapping of the princess whom he loves does not appear reflected in his imperturbable expression. He only stops for a moment, with a fleeting blowing to fix, like an arrow, his glance on the walls of the castle and to tighten the teeth with desperation. He never faced so many and so big dangers. In each bend, in each stay of the great castle of Beni-Gmez it's awaiting him, threatening, the death. But there is no space for the doubt nor to lie down back. The decision is already taken. The ground runs, it almost flies under the firm and implacable push of his feet...     Guide Sir Fred, through the different rooms of the castle, until finding his beloved princess. Take into account that she can be prisoner in different stays, and pay attention to the objects you can find on the way; they will help you to avoid the dangers which are distributed through all the adventure.
