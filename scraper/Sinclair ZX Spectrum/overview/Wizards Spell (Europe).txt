	Many years ago, Isluidir the Wizard had great power, before an Evil Wizard came from afar to do battle. When a slave stole Isluidir's spell book, he had  no hope of victory, and was doomed to a life of imprisonment. You are his only hope - he offers great riches if you can return his spells. You are assisted on your journey by the Wizard's friend Zod, who will offer advice and encouragement. Wizards Spell is a textual adventure in which half the screen is taken up by visual representations of your surroundings.
