This unofficial interpretation of Monopoly can be played by up to five players, with the computer able to play as one, as well as doing all the banking. Only three squares of the board are displayed at a time, as a continuous sequence with no corners. Chance and Community Chest cards reflect those in the real game.    Pressing X during your turn brings up the options page. This lets you view who owns each property, and how much money they have. It is through here that you can buy houses/hotels and trade with opponents.
