You have 3 lives and each life has an energy bar which is depleted by contact with aliens and can be replenished by picking up the 'E' powerup. Other powerups include 3 way fire and an overhead shield. There are various instant death hazards you must avoid such as a plant which smothers you and a dragon which devours you and spits out your bones.
