	Pool is a fairly simple game using cue-ball physics and concepts, played on a standard 6 pocket table. As well as the cue ball there are 3 red and 3 blue balls.With each shot you are aiming to pot one of these - the score being either 10 (red) or 20 (blue) multiplied by the level of the game, and by how many shots it took you to pot one. If you go through 3 shots without potting anything, or commit a foul stroke, a life is lost - you start with 4. Once you've cleared the table, you move onto the next level, where scores are multiplied. 2 human players can play alternately, with each one aiming to outscore the other.
