	Published by ACE Software and developed by Cybadyne, who are also responsible for a very similar game named Master Blaster, this shoot-em-up embarks you and possibly a friend in multiplayer on a quest to defeat the Zedar.   The concept of the gameplay is simple, but the game is hard to master or even complete, necessitating a memorization of the patterns in which the enemies or end-level bosses attack.   It can be controlled with either the keyboard, a joystick or any combination between the two.  The game was advertised as the "first coin-op style game for the Spectrum to feature options for 1 player or 2 players (on screen as the same time!)"
