	The kingdom of Asgard is in danger and only one of its Gods has the sufficient power to save it- Thor, the God of the thunder. The origin of this danger has been the death of Balder, son of Odin, God of Gods, who died by means of a dagger involved in green leafs. But in this kind of mystical histories there is always a bad guy, Loki, who was the one in charge to order this murder after knowing the prophecy- the death of Balder would bring the decline of the Gods, that would be attacked by a litter of rabid wolves without mercy. And that is indeed what our protagonist must prevent.     For it, he must destroy a series of eggs, where the components of the litter of wolves are being developed, which are located in a castle (where the game will take place) in the distant territories of Vendha, where the children of the devil Surtur guard them jealously awaiting for your arrival. Your means to end with them as well as with other smaller enemies, will be to project thunders against them, the blows of your magic hammer, and of course, your ability with the keyboard.
