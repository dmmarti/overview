	Heartland's meta-referential plot involves a struggle between good and evil, as depicted in a book, the last six pages of which have become lost. As a result, you must dive into the game's world to complete the story, and ensure that evil doesn't win, by saving the white pages and destroying the black ones.    There are six levels, all with distinctly cutesy themes and colourful graphics. The level layouts are extremely complicated, and you have to make your way back to base after each one, before being transported onto the next one, all within a time limit. The levels are full of wizards who must be shot, as well as a small amount of character interaction.
