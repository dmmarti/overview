European Soccer Challenge allows you to play as one of fourteen European football teams (including the mighty Wrexham) against another player or the computer. Options include the number of players, your skill level and the team you want to play as. The match is viewed from above showing a small part of the pitch. The joystick controls the nearest player to the ball and the fire button allows you to shoot or pass. The keyboard is used to select your options on the menu screens.
