In the first half of 21st century technological advances allowed for construction of artificial islands. One of such military installations, ARTROCK 6, had turned rogue after being hit by a violent storm, its computer-controlled defensive systems firing upon anything that comes close. The player, being a top pilot, has been chosen to fly an upgraded F-14+2d Tomcat jet to destroy this electronic madness. Tomcat is a vertically scrolling top-down shooter set in the near future. You can pick up weapon upgrades (more guns, missiles) from destroyed enemies.
