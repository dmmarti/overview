	A flick screen action adventure game in the vein of UPG's Atic Atac in which an adventurer is trapped in a labyrinth and to escape he must collect the missing pieces of a magic scroll. To achieve this the player has to navigate the 256 rooms of the  labyrinth, fending of the various creatures that lurk within it. To aid the adventurer in this task, a variety of weapons and tools are scattered around the labyrinth such as over sized fly swatters and buckets of water. This game was released on the little known "Budgie" budget arm of Alligata Software.
