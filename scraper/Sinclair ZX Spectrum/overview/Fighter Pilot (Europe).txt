	An area of 15000 square miles is incorporated into this combat flight simulation from specialists Digital Integration. A full cockpit view is recreated, including gauges for airspeed and vertical speed. You can take off, land and shoot it out, with full practice modes on offer. Blind flying, cross winds and air turbulence are modelled accurately and can be used for a more advanced flying experience. A map is built in, as is full recreation of the targeting facilities of a F15.
