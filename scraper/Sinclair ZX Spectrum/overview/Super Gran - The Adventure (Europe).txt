Scunner Campbell has stolen some valuable items from the museum and Town Hall in the town of Chisleton and it's up to you as Super Gran to find him and retrieve the stolen items. Super Gran: The Adventure is a graphic text adventure (the C16 version is text only) based on the characters of the 80s TV series. On the screen you see a picture of your surroundings while text describes your location. You type in commands to move about the game and interact with various items.
