	To escape the Planet of Steps, Pogo must paint each of the 28 steps set colour on each of the 16 levels of what boils down to a Q*Bert-style game. On the first four levels he must only step on each square once to change its colour, after that this must be done twice. Trying to stop Pogo are a range of enemies including glass balls (which comes down from the top), scorpions (which move from side-to-side) and snakes (which pursue Pogo). There are flying saucers at the side of the screen - jump onto these to return to the top of the screen. After completing each level a bonus is awarded.
