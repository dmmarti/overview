Time to get your brain working and answer some trivia to get to the top of the triangle. Each question has a time limit to answer and you use F1, F3 and F5 to answer A, B or C. The triangle is made up of 21 squares. The bottom row has six squares worth five points. The second row has five worth 10 points and so on before you get to the last square worth 500 points. The aim is to fill all squares. You can get one question wrong or pass one question.
