Lancer Lords is a single player combat game that has the player jousting with other knights atop an ostrich. Every victory over another knight causes the defeated ostrich to lay an egg before mount and rider disappear in a puff of smoke. These eggs must be destroyed before they hatch into another opponent. As the game progresses the levels become harder with progressively more ostriches in the arena and shorter hatching times for the eggs. The game is played either with the keyboard or the joystick.
