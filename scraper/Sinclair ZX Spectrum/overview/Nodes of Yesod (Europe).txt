	Strange signals are coming from the moon and Charlemagne Fotheringham-Grunes (or Charlie for short), member of the International Commission for Universal Problem Solving (I.C.U.P.S.) is sent to investigate. It turns out that the source of the signals is a strange monolith. The aim of the game is to destroy this monolith.    Nodes of Yesod is an Arcade Adventure seen from a side-scrolling perspective. Charlie can jump and, after finding it first, use a device called mole. After pressing up on on the joystick, Charlie stands still and the player gains control over the mole that can be used to attack enemies. However, not all enemies can be harmed by the mole. Another useful device is the burrowing chum that can be used to dig through certain walls. Before Charlie can reach the monolith, he has to explore the many caverns of the moon and find eight keys or alchiems. Every now and then a red spaceman will show up, and touching him will cause Charlie to loose one of his keys.
