	The Genon computer has been making life a misery throughout the Cosmos, and the time has come where it has to be neutralized. Having been selected to attempt this task, and beamed onto the planet, this is your task. You must reach the centre of the maze, crack the code to destroy it, and then make good your escape.    The game is an early use of first-person 3D with real-time movement, using a rounded wall effect, with the main hazards being doors which move up and down at pace (faster once you are near the central Corridor 30). You must stay away from the Boguls, which chase you and are unimpeded by the doors. The computer sets more of these on you as it is destroyed. Cracking the code is such an intricate task that you can practice it before playing.
