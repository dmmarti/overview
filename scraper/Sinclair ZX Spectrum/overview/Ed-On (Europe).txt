	Ed-On is a clone of the arcade game Head On. It's a racing game where the player has to drive his car counter clockwise around a four lane circuit. Once the whole circuit has been completed, the player will move on to the next level. All around the circuit are dots, that show where the player hasn't been. The level is finished when all dots are gone. The player also must avoid the AI controlled cars that race in the opposite direction. If he would crash he loses one life. On the first level there's only one car to rise against, but the numbers increases for every level. Sometimes flags will show up on the circuit. Picking these up will give extra points. The game uses directional keys to jump between lanes, as well as speed up and slow down.
