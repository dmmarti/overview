	Based on the Fighting Fantasy book of the same title (very loosely, bearing a far closer resemblance to CC's earlier Halls of the Things), the game places the player in the vast labyrinth beneath Firetop Mountain. Avoiding the orcs, spiders and slime moulds that patrol the tunnels and rooms, the sword and bow wielding player must find and collect 15 keys and then find the Warlock's treasure chest (drawing the invincible Warlock away to gain access to it) in order to escape with the treasure therein.    With the maze randomly generated each time the game is played, the user is presented with a unique exploring experience for each game.
