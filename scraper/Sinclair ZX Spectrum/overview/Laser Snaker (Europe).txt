	Laser Snaker puts you in control of a hungry snake, which must travel around the screen eating all the variously colored balls. As each one is consumed, the snake becomes longer, making it harder to maneuver around the various obstacles on the levels. These include barriers and blobs (the latter move, the former don't; both can be shot if necessary) and rival snakes. These travel around collecting the balls, which makes clearing the level quicker, but reduces the number of points on offer. You can shoot at any part of these, which cuts off the part beyond the impact point.    Beyond the initial 'trainee' mode, in which progress through level after level will probably only be stopped by sheer boredom, there are 10 speed settings. The 5 difficulty levels determine how many snakes must be faced, and how restrictive the walls of the levels are. Some levels have a flashing blue section in the centre. Reach this to clear the screen and gain an extra live (you start with 3).
