	Quadrax is a puzzle game where two characters have to be moved to a predefined place in logical levels. As the entire screen is filled with obstacles, the characters need to help each other get around by flipping switching, moving stone blocks, opening doors, and using lifts. It was originally released for the ZX Spectrum with 50 levels. The PC version conversion contains 100 levels, with variations on the same themes.
