	Aiee! An endless stream of Nazgul! Control Gandalf on his great white horse as you zap your way through them. Avoid being hit by those black riders, while racking up points by blasting with Gandalfs magic lightening bolts.    The game never ends as you progress down through the rows of ring wraiths. The horse graphics are based on the famed photographic series of a galloping horse by Eadweard Muybridge.
