	A nearby planet is emitting a dangerous level of pollution, so you must go in destroy the source. The game is split into three levels, all of which are shoot 'em up based but in different ways. The first level has multi-directional scrolling and a maze aspect. The second is an into the screen 3D section requiring fast reactions. Finally you come to a horizontally scrolling, time-limited side-viewed section as you close in on destroying the emitter.
