	Like all robots on the Androids' planet, SID has a desolate existence of hard work and little pleasure. After a meeting with a renegade android philosopher called Socrates, SID decides to break out and attempt to gain freedom and independence.    To do this he will have to find three envelopes, which are located in three distinct sections of gameplay. The first is platform-based, involving jumping across rocky ledges to pick up objects and bring them back to the main computer at the start of the level. Part two puts you at the wheel of a car, picking up energy pills and using a (limited) shield to fend off attackers. The third part is a maze of sorts, and after this is completed you must make your way back to the computer through the caves again.
