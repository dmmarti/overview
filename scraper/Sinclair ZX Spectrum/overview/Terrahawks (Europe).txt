	Like perennial license favourite Thunderbirds, Terrahawks was written by Gerry Anderson, featured puppets, and was set in space. It is this latter element that the licensed game is built around, as you aim to pass Terrahawk Pilot Training.    To succeed, you must be able to deal with a black hole, which will take amazing thought and reaction speed. Having been sucked in you must fly through the vortex, reaching it by shooting out the monoliths which block your path. You must be careful not to collide with these more than 5 times, as that is all your shield can withstand. Also, avoid running out of fuel by flying as low among the monoliths as you can - the higher line is safer but consumes fuel much faster. There are 9 stratums of increasing difficulty to survive.
