	Pheenix is a classic shooter, similar to Space Invaders- In five different screens, you have to shoot birds whose droppings prove harmful for your spaceship. Luckily, you can activate a shield that will protect your vessel for a short time (you can't shoot during that time either though).    While the five different screens are similar, each one is unique in its way- In the third screen, you first see eggs flying around before the birds hatch and start unloading on you. And in the fifth screen, you have to destroy the enemy mothership.
