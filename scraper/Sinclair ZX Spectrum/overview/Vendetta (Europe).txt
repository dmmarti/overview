	You, a former army hero, have to save your brother (a military scientist who developed the ultimate weapon) and his little daughter who are kidnapped by blood-thirsty terrorists. The same terrorists you have fought  some years ago.   The cops think you are somehow involved in the kidnapping, and so your job is obvious- rescue your family members and wash your name clear.    The gameplay could be compared with the Last Ninja series. It has an isometric view and  no scrolling. You can pick up useful items like weapons, which blink when you enter a screen containing such an item.
