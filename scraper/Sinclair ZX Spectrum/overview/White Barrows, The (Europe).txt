This is a text based game that has elements from a multiple genres dungeon crawl, puzzle, logic challenge, and even resource management. The back story is about a bad wizard who's stolen a magic chalice and you play the plucky adventurer who has to get it back. The bad guy is hiding in the ancient burial grounds, or barrows. The game is based on a map of the barrows in which there are 40 or so rooms. You are dropped randomly into a room. In other rooms are gnomes, trolls, dragons etc and in one room is the wizard. The game is played by moving from room to room exploring. You may view connecting rooms. You may raise a magic wall in an adjacent room. However you have only 400 magic points and viewing or raising a wall costs points so it's important to find the wizard before points run out. The game is a text game. There is only one graphic which is the map that shows how the rooms are connected.
