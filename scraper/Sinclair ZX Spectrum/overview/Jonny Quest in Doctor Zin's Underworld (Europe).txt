Based on the TV cartoon character Jonny Quest, you take the role of Jonny in this flick screen arcade adventure viewed from the side. Your Father Brenton Quest has been kidnapped by the evil Dr. Zin and forced to make a laser which will be used to take over the world. It's your mission to rescue your Father by exploring Dr. Zin's complex and picking up and using various objects scattered outside and inside the complex. These items include keys to open doors and torches to see in dark places but you are limited to carrying four items. As you explore you will come across various enemies and if these touch you then you lose part of your energy bar and when this is empty then it is game over. You are able to punch and kick as well as having the ability to jump large heights and distances. This ability must be used carefully because if you jump too high then you lose part of your energy. Pressing left or right twice quickly gives you the ability to run instead of walking. As well as the main playing area you can see items carried, energy bar and the percentage of the game completed.
