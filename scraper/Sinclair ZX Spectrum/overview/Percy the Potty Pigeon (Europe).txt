Percy the Pigeon needs to build a nest and this requires ten twigs to be collected which are scattered over a side viewed scrolling level which scrolls left and right when you move. Problem is the twigs are on a road which is full of cars and cats and you have to swoop down to get the twigs avoiding the moving traffic and cats and if they are touched you lose one of three lives. An extra life is awarded when a score of 10,000 points is achieved. You are armed with eggs which can be dropped on the cars and cats to make them disappear. Hazards in the sky to look out for and avoid are planes and other birds and these can't be bombed and you lose a life if touched as well. You can only carry one twig at a time and when you have one you must take it back to your nest before trying to collect another one. Sparrows fly around the level and when touched make you drop your twig and if you fire an egg to bomb you lose the twig as well. All ten twigs must be collected before a bar indicating the time reaches zero and when the nest is built then you move on to the next level. Before you play the game you can select which level to play with the game consisting of ten levels. The higher each level gets, the more dangers there are and each danger is faster.
