	Aladdin must venture through three caves in search of the legendary magic lamp. While searching for the lamp, he must avoid many hazards such as bouncing boulders, deadly portcullises, moving walls, vampire bats, and a treacherous elevator. If Aladdin makes contact with these hazards, he falls off his magic carpet and is returned to the start of the cave. Once he has made his way to the third cave, he must find some way to get the lamp, which is guarded by a huge fire-breathing dragon. When he has this, Aladdin goes back to the first cave to get another magic lamp.
