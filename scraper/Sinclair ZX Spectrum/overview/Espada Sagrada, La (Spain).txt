	La Espada Sagrada is an arcade-videoadventure mix that consists of 3 phases, 2 of them inspired by the classic videoadventure genre of the eighties and the third being a classical arcade game.    The hero player (Atahualpa Yupanqui) aims to obtain 'The Sacred Sword', and problems through the 2 early stages must be solved in order to find it. Then in a third phase full of action, take advantage of that sword to be victorious.    The two early stages have no side scrolling, while the third one is an arcade with horizontal scroll and non-stop action and big sprites.    To access levels 2 and 3 you need a code, which is provided once you finish the previous one.
