 3D-Interceptor is a 3rd person shooter where you sit behind a spacecraft, flying into the screen and blast various aliens over various stages. You move your craft left or right and you blast any alien that appears in front of you. As you blast or avoid the aliens you have a gas gauge which decreases but pyramids can be collected to increase your gas. If you hit any alien then you lose one of three lives and after a short period of blasting you then move to the next stage.
