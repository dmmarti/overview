In this graphic adventure game from Melbourne House, the player must venture into the vampire's castle to rescue a fair maid. Players proceed through the game by reading a description of each scene, then entering one- or two word commands at a prompt. The commands can be simple or complex, and the player can perform more than one action on a single line. Animated characters feature in some scenes of the game, and there is background music during play.
