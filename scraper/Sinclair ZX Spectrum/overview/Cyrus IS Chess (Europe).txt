	The classic game of chess against the computer.  The AI has ten skill levels and can effectively play both sides as the player can ask for recommendations which are calculated according to current level.  Moves are performed by typing in the coordinates and the game supports advanced moves like castling.    There is no way to save the game in progress but the screen can be copied to the ZX Printer with a single command.  The board can also be set up freely in order to test different scenarios or just to recall a game "saved" to a printout.
