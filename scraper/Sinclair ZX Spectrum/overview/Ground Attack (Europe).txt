	A horizontally scrolling shooter in the Scramble style, Ground Attack puts you in the pilot seat of a spaceship, navigating your way into a series of narrowing caverns. You have to avoid (or preferably destroy with your forward mounted laser) the missiles that launch when you get near, and bomb the fuel dumps, whilst at the same time navigating the tortuously undulating cavern floor and ceiling.    With 9 different speed settings to play the game at, the gameplay can be tailored to your personal skill level. With no final goal, it's simply a matter of racking up as high a score as you can before your lives run out.
