	Tank Trax is a single screen arcade-strategy game featuring two human-controlled tanks in combat. A randomly generated set of mountains and valleys is created, and the tanks are placed upon this. Each player then takes it in turn to direct shots at each other by setting their pace and angle, factoring in the wind as well as the placement of the tanks. Battles can be played at night, resulting in invisible enemy tanks. Although Kempston joysticks are supported, keyboard control is perfectly adequate.
