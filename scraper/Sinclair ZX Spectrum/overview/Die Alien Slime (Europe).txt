Die Alien Slime is a simple shooter with top-down perspective, like Alien Syndrome. The player controls a lone spaceman, who must fight against aliens and activate special terminals. Many of these terminals can be found scattered around the ship. In the space base there are many barriers: doors, transport blocks and energy barriers. The space base is a labyrinth, colonized by hundreds of aliens.
