	Most early Mikro-Gen releases were derived from popular arcade games, and this one is no exception, giving Centipede the 16K treatment. As such, the basic gameplay involves shooting at a centipede that moves down the screen towards you, going from right to left, then down, then across the next line of the screen from left to right, and so on.    In this version you will also have to face a spider and a bug on each screen, which will fire at you before being shot out. The pace is higher than usual, which makes the lack of support for common joysticks, coupled with the choice of control keys, a potential problem.
