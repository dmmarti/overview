The late Sir Roger Durwood's (or Blackbeard's) ghost is wandering the village of Moonholm in eternal damnation looking for the Ellisnore Diamond to help him rest in peace. Blackbeard was rewarded with the diamond after hiding Charles the First in Carisbrooke Castle from the Roundheads, but once the diamond was received, Blackbeard denounced the king. After being stripped from his Governorship, he retired to the village and lived in seclusion despised by the locals for his actions. After hiding the diamond, he decided to get the diamond and sell it to help fund the local Parish to rid himself of his guilt but forgot its hiding place and now after his death he is still searching. You have been summoned to the village of your birth to find the missing diamond to help the Parish and to let Blackbeard rest in peace but before you arrive the village was severely ruined by a storm which flooded the village leaving many homes in ruins. As you arrive you need to enter your cottage to get the stuff you need for your quest but the key you hid has gone missing. The Ellisnore Diamond is a text adventure where the screen has text describing your location and you type in commands with the keyboard to interact with your surroundings.
