	Sequel to Athena, the 2d side-scroller which starred a "kawaii" version of the greek goddess Athena as she set out to find adventure in the mortal world.    Changing her bikini for a Japanese schoolgirl uniform, Athena uses her new psychic powers (hence "psycho" soldier... erm... yep, anyway...) to clear a post-apocalyptic world of its mutant inhabitants with the help of her friend Kensu (thus allowing simultaneous 2 player gameplay).    Gameplay consists of the usual run 'n jump fare typical of the genre with the added feature of a constantly scrolling background, which added to the many "option"-style power-ups and Athena's own psychic blasts make the game a strange shooter/platformer hybrid.
