Auf Wiedersehen Pet was a British TV series that ran from 1983 to 2004 over five series which showed the exploits of a group of English builders over various locations around the world. The game is based on the first series which first introduced us to the gang on a building site in Dusseldorf, West Germany and concentrates on one of the main characters, Leonard Oz Osborne. Oz was a bricklayer who didn't like foreigners, liked a drink and was always getting into a fight and we follow him through one day over three single screen games. The idea is to play each game to get a high score and if you complete or even fail each game, you then move to the next one. The Building Site: You have been told by your boss, Herr Fuhrer to build a wall as high and wide as you can. You watch Oz move along laying bricks and you can build upwards or you can move in the opposite direction but you can't lay bricks if there are no bricks underneath. Scattered around the screen are 'Erics' and these must be avoided as well as falling trowels. If you fall off the edge of the screen, touch an Eric or trowel, or lay a brick without one underneath then the game ends. The Bier Keller: After a hard days bricklaying, Oz likes to go to the local bar and drink himself stupid and you must control Oz who moves constantly and collect all the beer glasses on the screen. As you move around the screen, barmaids appear and you must avoid them, tables or the walls, or the game is ended. The Way Home: The bar has been shut at 11:30pm and you must now make your way home to your hut and your bed. Problem is that there are plenty of police cars in the area as well as security guards and these have to be avoided. After seeing your route home, there are more problems as most of the lamp posts have switched off leaving most of the walk home in complete darkness. You must memorise the route and move up the screen but if you touch an object then the game is ended.
