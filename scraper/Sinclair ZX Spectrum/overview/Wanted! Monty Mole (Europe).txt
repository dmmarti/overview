	Monty Mole is keen to steal as much coal as he can, and if possible, obtain control of coal production. Once he's got the loot, his job is to escape through the castle.    Gameplay is a flick-screen platform affair, with 21 screens full of challenges. Expect to be confronted by man-eating fish, crushing machines and precision-jumping tasks. All manner of objects can be collected, sometimes by taking a more precarious route through a screen, adding a real puzzle element to the game.
