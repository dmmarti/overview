	You wake up one morning, covered in blood but seemingly uninjured. Could the rumours about a Werewolf's curse having returned be true, and could you be the one struck with this curse? Yes, they could.    The game is split into three parts, played through the eyes of a different character each time. In the first you are the Werewolf's host, and must beat the curse back. Sex is added to ultra-violence in part 2; you play the woman who loves him, and must survive a night of passion. In part 3 you play the host again, and must reach Fi Shan monastery to find the cure.
