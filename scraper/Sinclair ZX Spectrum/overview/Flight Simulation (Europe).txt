	In an era when flight simulation for the masses was starting to become a reality, this program offered Spectrum users the chance to experience the feel of a small airplane. Each aspect of control is recreated, from taking off to landing, with control and navigation tested along the way.     In total there are 13 controls used, including joystick and rudder movement, throttle control, flap and undercarriage adjustment, navigation beacon control, and an inbuilt map. The map shows the locations of the two airports, as well as some of the key landmarks, and is used to ensure that you are heading in the right direction to land. Your in-flight computer is there to aid landing and navigating, with all the standard dials and lights built-in.
