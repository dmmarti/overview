	This game aims to recreate five-a-side football as accurately as possible, from a side-on forced perspective. The main tournament involves 8 international teams, with 2 skill levels and variable match lengths.    Five a side football differs from the full game in many ways. The teams consist of 4 outfield players and a goalkeeper is the outfield players can,t encroach into the goal area (which is a semi-circle rather than a rectangle). The arena is walled, making judging ricochets important, and the ball can,t be hit above head height.
