While on a recce mission to investigate a secret enemy location, your plane is shot down and you are sent hurtling towards the island's surface. This is where you come in, and through text commands you must initially bring the plane under control. After this you must locate the stronghold and returning to your plane. To get back past enemy fire, you must return in disguise, so you must also avoid your side shooting at you by mistake. The game features a simple 'Verb Noun' command interface, and no graphics of any description.
