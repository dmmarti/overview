Times are tough living in 1930's Chicago as the Mouse Mafia have a monopoly on cheese and the inhabitants are desperate for a change. Good news has raised everyone's spirits as it is discovered that the moon is made of cheese, but the good news turns to bad as it has now been discovered that ten members of the Mafia have hatched a plan to steal the moon. You play the role of Murray Mouse as you attempt to find and arrest all ten Mouse Mafia members before the moon can be stolen. Murray Mouse: Supercop is a flick screen, viewed from the side, arcade adventure in the same style as Codemater's other heroes, Dizzy and Seymour. You must find items scattered around the game and place them in their correct locations to solve puzzles. You can only carry two items at a time and to pick up or drop them, then you press the fire button.
