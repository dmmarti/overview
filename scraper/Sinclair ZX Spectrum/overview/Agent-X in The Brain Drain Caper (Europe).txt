A mad professor has kidnapped the President, and the ransom note says he plans to turn him into a war-mongering maniac (shouldn't be too difficult as I write this....). As Agent X, you must rescue him before he can be brainwashed.    The game is multi-section, and loads in a number of parts (as they are too big to all fit in the memory together), unusually for a budget-price release . The first section involves driving along a diagonally-scrolling road, attempting to ram various cars and trucks into holes, while avoiding them yourself. Later on you must negotiate shooting galleries and Green Beret-esque beat 'em up sections. Throughout all of this the character's depleting energy is depicted by a graphic of the sprite walking towards a gravestone.
