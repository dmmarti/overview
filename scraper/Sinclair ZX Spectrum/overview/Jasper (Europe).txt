	Jasper the mouse must face 22 screens in this platform puzzler. Tonnes of objects are placed throughout the game, and each has a specific use. You select these using the 1-5 number keys, which tells you that only 5 objects can be carried at a time, which makes for a certain degree of backtracking. The screens are full of adversaries like cats, spiders and wasps, all of which must be avoided, as contact loses you a life. Methodical planning of your route before you start, and inch-perfect timing and key-pressing once you do, are essential for progress - charging in headlong is unlikely to produce anything but a dead mouse (and a dead keyboard after you hit it)
