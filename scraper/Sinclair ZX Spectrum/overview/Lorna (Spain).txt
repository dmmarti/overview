	Lorna is the typical sexy heroine who fights against the foreign aliens in a distant place.    This game follows the standard style of "go ahead and kill all anything that interpose on your way", those "friends" that will want to complicate your existence will be a varied mutant monsters, and, to defend yourself, you will be able to use hand-to-hand attack techniques, and if you prefer, you can use your always effective assault-rifle.     This game is based on the popular Alfonso Aspiriz's comic book.
