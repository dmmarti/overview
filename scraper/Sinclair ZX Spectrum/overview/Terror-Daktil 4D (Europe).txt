	You're in your plane flying over the jungles of South America. Suddenly the engines fail and the captain cannot land safely because there's a volcano ahead, so you crash (The game actually starts with an introduction consisting of a couple of announcements from the captain, in text, and a slide show of shots representing the flight and subsequent crash. This can be skipped if necessary) You wake up the next day some distance from the crash and, in the distance, you see the Terror Daktils gathering! Luckily, in the nearby valley there are three cannons. You drag one onto the plateau and shoot the Terror Daktils as they attack    Shoot waves of attacking beasts and keep shooting them. You must survive for six days and six nights, if you can do this a rescue plane will reach you.  Only one cannon ball can be in flight at a time and they do fly like cannon balls. There's no cross hairs, and no straight line of flight, the cannon balls travel in an arc towards the flock that moves back and forth in the distance.   Occasionally one will swoop towards you. If it can be shot it scores highly, however if it strikes the cannon then that's a life lost. Points are scored for each type of Daktil killed, (first row, second row, third row, swooping) and night time kills score double.
