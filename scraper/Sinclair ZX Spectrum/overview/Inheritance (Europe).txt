In the sequel to The Inheritance: Panic in Las Vegas you've found yourself in Scotland. Your Aunt has donated her castle, but alas, you must prove your identity. Your family book is somewhere in this castle and false nephews are popping up everywhere. What a chaos! As its predecessor, the game is played in first-person view with point-and-click interface. The player moves a cursor in the screen with the ARROW KEYS, and interacts with objects by pressing the ACTION key. Inventory is now limited to 4 items and moved to the bottom of the screen. The game now consists of single load, but to make it more difficult a percentage of your hungriness is introduced to the game. It is equal to 99 at the beginning and is decreasing with time flow. You should keep an eye on it and fill it, eating food found in the castle. During the game, you, Mr. Peter Stone, will interact with different persons and collect/use different items. Some of your actions may be lethal for the others, but you should also keep your alive and get your Inheritance finally.
