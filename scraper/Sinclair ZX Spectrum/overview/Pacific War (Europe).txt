	Pacific War' recreates the  carrier duels between the US Navy and Imperial Japanese Navy at the battle of Guadalcanal in 1942.    The player takes control of the US forces consisting of three carrier task forces, as well as land-based aircraft at Henderson Field. The computer controls six task forces, which you must first find by sending search planes along flight paths to selected points on the map. Once found, torpedo planes and dive bombers can be sent to the contact points - assuming the Japanese haven't found you first!
