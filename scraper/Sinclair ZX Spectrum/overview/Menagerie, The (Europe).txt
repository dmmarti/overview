	The Menagerie is a text adventure with graphics with a lot of references to The Hitchhikers Guide To The Galaxy. You take the role of Jim, a vampire. The game starts with that you are searched after by the police for your attacks of the citizens of the town. The police lose track of you and you come in contact with aliens who strike you with a blue ray which causes you to pass out. When you wake up you get to know that you are now a resident of a menagerie, specialising in unusual species. The problem is that your life expectancy has been reduced and to overcome this problem you have to find the Bloodstone of Baal. The game contains reportedly 70 locations.
