In this notably quirky cult classic you take the role of The Balrog, a large gentleman just trying to enjoy his morning, who has been locked in an outhouse by some mischief makers. With only a pencil stub, your copy of the Goblins' Gazzette. Will Balrog make it out, perhaps to wreck havoc upon those that would dare pull a prank on you while in the safety of 'the smallest room'? Or will Balrog be trapped, with naught but the commode for company and solace in his old age?
