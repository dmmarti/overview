Premier League is a football management game where you must try to win the league against seven other teams from England. There are five skill levels (1-5) to select and you also can edit team and players names. Options are limited to buying and selling players, deciding to have a special training session, and selecting your team for the next game. After comparing your team with your opponents you move to the match highlights which is text only and you just wait for any major incident to happen. You can select your sub at half-time and half-way through the 2nd half. After the game you can see your weekly balance before selecting your options for your next game.
