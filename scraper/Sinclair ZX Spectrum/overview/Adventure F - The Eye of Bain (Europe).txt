The Eye of Bain is the sixth in Artic's Adventure Series. The player represents a warrior who is in search of the sacred Eye of Bain emerald, which is located withing the Temple of Bain. The first task is to escape from a village, in which you are chained to a pole and awaiting sacrifice; once escaping the village you can continue your quest to find the gem. You must drink water to stay alive, and avoid enemies and pitfalls along the way.    Unlike the previous games in the series, The Eye of Bain has graphical representations of the room you are in. These are off by default and are activated by typing LOOK. You must then switch back to the actual input screen by pressing enter. As in the previous games in the series, the player uses simple verb/noun commands.
