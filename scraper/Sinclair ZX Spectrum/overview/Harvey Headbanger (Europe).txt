	Rotund drinkers Harvey Headbanger and Hamish Highball are at war in this single-screen action duel with a strategic edge. Walking across each of the 64 squares will turn them to your colour. Create a 3x3 box of these squares to release cocktails (of your own colour, so only you can use them) and top up your energy. Contact costs each player energy, but the player with a higher energy level can get up first. The aim to win a point is to trap your opponent inside a box of your squares. You can play to anything from 1 to 10 points, and at 5 difficulty levels in a one-player game.
