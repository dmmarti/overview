	Conversion of the Capcom arcade to home computers. The player adopts the identity of an ancient Chinese warrior, and riding on horseback has to eliminate all his opponents, mostly infantry and archers.    The game uses a lateral scroll and the player can move in all four directions. A novelty is the attack system- when pressing fire the energy of the attack will load up as the warrior moves his spear up and backwards, in order to gain momentum. The more the player can keep fire pressed, the more powerful the attack will be.    The game spawned a sequel in the arcades, "Warriors of fate", and is not to be confused with the PSX game of the same title, which is a one-on-one fighting game.
