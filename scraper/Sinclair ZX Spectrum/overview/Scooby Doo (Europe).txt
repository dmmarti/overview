	Scooby's friends Shaggy, Fred, Daphne and Velma have been kidnapped in an enormous castle owned by an evil genius. It's Scooby's job to travel through it and rescue them in this platforms 'n' ladders beat 'em up.    Enemies include ghosts emerging from doors, bats which must be ducked, skulls to jump over,  springy thingies, and Ghoulfish. Scooby has plenty of attacking moves, but must be stationary to launch into one. You start with six lives, and get extras by picking up Scooby Snacks, and by completing each of the four levels.
