	In a Star Trek-style future, a serum to be created from three Crystals located in far-off lands is required to save humanity. Only the USS Spectrum and its brave captain (you) can do this. Unfortunately, the ship's warp drive is malfunctioning and will soon be useless, so you must quickly get to the engine room and direct yourself into a distant galaxy using the co-ordinate system. Once there you will encounter aliens and robots, and must visit some of these hostile planets. Kill foes, navigate planets and use switches in the QUILLed adventure using VERB NOUN input.
