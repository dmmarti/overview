	Chicago in the 30s. You are an aspiring boss of a criminal organization and plan to make big money. Easier said than done, though - you will have to decide how much money to spend on money and how much to invest. And doing a good job might be bad for your health, since other organizations might hire hitmen to eliminate you.    The game features stylish graphics and is presented - not unlike King of Chicago - through conversations with other goons of your mob. And if you lose all your money or men, you will get the unforgettable message by your right-hand man... "What a schmuck you are, Mugsy."
