	Use your scooter to roar through these mean streets within a tough time limit, in a side-scrolling Metrocross-style game. Barriers, rough ground and ramps are in the way, as are other scooter riders from level 3 onwards. You will have to swerve or jump around them. Using jumps requires positioning and timing your landing successfully so as not to fall.    The action is side-scrolling, with 5 different positions on the screen featuring a variety of clear spaces and hazards. Time bonuses and speed boosts are available.
