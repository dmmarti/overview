	One of the earliest person-licensed computer games, Olympic legend Daley Thompson lent his name to an old-style joystick waggling frenzy. Ten events were featured, including long and high jumps as well as the predictable sprints, which made for some gameplay variety. You have 3 lives, and lose one every time you fail at an event, which you usually get 3 attempts at. For each event you see both the qualifying time and the world record, which gives you something to aim at.
