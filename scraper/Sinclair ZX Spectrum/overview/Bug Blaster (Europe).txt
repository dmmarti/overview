Inspired by the arcade game Centipede, Bug Blaster is a single screen shooter where you must destroy a Centipede that moves from the top of the screen. The Centipede moves across the screen and when it reaches the other side it moves down one place and moves back across the screen. You control a spacecraft at the bottom of the screen shooting the Centipede whilst moving left or right, as well being able to move forwards and backwards a short distance. Shooting the Centipede a number of times splits it into two and the other parts split into two when shot a number of times. Scattered around the screen are mushrooms and when the Centipede hits them then it changes directions but the mushrooms can be shot to make them disappear and receive points. Other creatures make an appearance and need shooting or avoiding and they are a insect that places more mushrooms, spiders, scorpions and snails and if you are touched by any creatures then you lose one of three lives. Destroying all parts of the Centipede moves you to the next level.
