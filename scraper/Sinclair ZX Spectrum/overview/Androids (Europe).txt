Androids is a maze / shoot 'em up type of game for one player.    The game consists of a maze. The objective is to travel through the maze to find the exit.   En-route are androids who will try to kill you. You have a laser that only holds seven shots and a shield that can stand five hits.   Both of these can be recharged by walking over special squares, blue patterned ones recharge  the laser and red patterned ones recharge the shield.  Also in the maze are doors, represented by cyan coloured squares. The player can pass through these but the androids cannot.    Points are scored for completing the maze before the time bonus runs out and for killing each android.     The mazes are large and are made to seem even larger because they wrap around making it possible to travel in circles
