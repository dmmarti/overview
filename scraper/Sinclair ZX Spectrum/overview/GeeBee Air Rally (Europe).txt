Gee Bee Air Rally adds another dimension to motor racing - literally, as the action takes place in the sky. It targets the feel of pioneering races between 250mph planes in the valleys of the southern USA between brave but honest goggle-wearing men - a sort of Mille Miglia in the sky. The game consists of 16 courses, which are marked out by giant suspended cones, each of which is to be completed against a time limit, while avoiding contact with the other planes. You must stay within the cones, any time spent outside it results in the alloted time ticking down at a prohibitively fast rate (so don't think of short-cutting the track). After every second successful race, you take on a bonus track, in which balloons must be hit for points.
