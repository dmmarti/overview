	Aliens are attacking the research station. As the security chief you have to guide the scientists to the rescue ship, along with their experiments, when they each wake up and start running around. Rescue as many as you can, because one of them has the answer to winning the whole war, but you don't know which. And don't forget to collect fuel for the trip.
