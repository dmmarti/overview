	Tranz Am is set in a post-apocalyptic world, placing you on the ruins of America. Eight Great Cups of Ultimate are scattered around the country, and you must collect these in your vehicle.    Fuel is in short supply, and you must drive over one of the fuel pumps to refill. Contact with trees costs you a life, as does contact with the Black Patrol Cars. The gameworld has an invisible border, which causes the car to reverse automatically, so watch out that this doesn't cause a crash. There is a map at the side of the screen, which locates the fuel and your car, but obviously not the Cups.
