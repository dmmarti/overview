Peter Pack Rat loves to collect things by his home in the local junkyard. Peter must collect a certain amount of objects scattered around the yard and take them back to his home to complete a level. Peter Pack Rat is a platform game viewed from the side. You take control of Peter and must navigate platforms, ladders and pipes. Various objects are collected including keys. Peter can even swim across water. To make things more difficult baddies fly and run around trying to hurt Peter. These can be avoided or shot at, which stuns them for a short time.
