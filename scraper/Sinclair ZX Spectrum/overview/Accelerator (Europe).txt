 The human race is in a state of decline after a 200 year war in the 25th Century against Alien Confederates, which has seen our race scattered all over the Universe on hostile worlds and sent us back to caveman times. Only one planet has escaped going backwards and advanced as a race and that is Sol and to save the humans, it has sent out scouting ships to rescue the remaining settlements. You are the captain of the ship, The United States of Sol Scout Ship and on one such mission you have encountered various waves of aliens and the only way to survive is to attack all 20 waves.  Accelerator is a side view single screen shooter where you control your ship by moving it around the screen blasting any aliens that appear from either the left or right of the screen. Also on the screen are mines left from the war and if you are hit by a mine, alien ship or it's weapons then you lose one of five lives. You also have to keep an eye on your fuel levels as firing your lasers decreases it but shooting any alien ship increases it. Once a wave is defeated you then move to the next one with an extra life.
