180 allows you to play a game of darts by yourself or against either the computer or another player. Before you play there are a number of games that can be selected and they are a one player game, two player game, Round the Board or Snooker. The one player game has you trying to get from the score 501 to zero, and you must try to get to zero within 20 darts and also finish with a double or Bullseye. If you manage to finish within 20 darts then you qualify for a league against seven other players and you must try to play one of seven games of darts in the lowest number of darts thrown. If you finish top of the league you then play four rounds of the World Championship which is a knock-out format.Two player game has you playing another player with a starting score of 101, 301 or 501 and you can also choose how many games to play from one, three or five. Round the Board is played between one or two players and the idea is to throw a dart in every number in order starting from one in the least number of darts thrown. Snooker is a two player game where you use the dart board to play a game of snooker. There are 15 reds and the other colours that make up a game of snooker and each segment of the board represents a colour. You must throw three darts in one colour to pot that colour starting with a red, and if potted you then choose a different coloured segment. The dart boards are seen from a 1st person perspective shown on the whole screen. To throw a dart, a line moves below the board and when a key is pressed, it stops the line and shows the position the length on the board the dart will land. Another line now appears to the left of the board and when stopped this shows the height the dart will land.
