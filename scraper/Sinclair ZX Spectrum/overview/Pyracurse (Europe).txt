	The Sinu tribe of South America have long been a mystery to explorers. Their God Xipe Totec demanded regular human sacrifices to retain his power, and he is still feared when Sir Pericles Pemberton-Smythe heads off to investigate his tomb. He disappears, leading his daughter Daphne to assemble a team to track him down, which is where the player comes in.    The team is made up of Daphne, her fiance Professor Kite, a drunken journalist known as 'Legless' O'Donnell, and her trusty dog Frozbie. You can control any of these in turn, and order them to lead the other members of the team. The Professor is the smartest at solving the puzzles you will encounter, Daphne takes after her father as a natural explorer, O'Donnell is physical strong, and Frozbie is good at rooting around uncovering hidden objects.    The Tombs are isometrically-viewed, with the perspective revealing some areas and concealing others. Zombies and other monsters wandering through the tomb must be avoided.    Each member can carry 3 objects, which are used to solve these puzzles - some objects are limited to certain characters. Options such as switching character, movement mode and object use are activated by pressing fire to bring up a menu, and using left and right to select the option.
