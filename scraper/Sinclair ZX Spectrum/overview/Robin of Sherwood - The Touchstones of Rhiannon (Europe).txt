	Robin of Sherwood is based on a 1980s UK TV retelling of the legendary hero. Robin is trapped inside the Sheriff's castle with Scarlett and Much. Once escaped, Herne the Hunter will inform him that he must find the six Touchstones of Rhiannon, as dictated by the Prophecies of Gildas. You are constantly evading recapture from the Sheriff, also having to deal with nuns, magicians and taxmen and the challenges they set you for rewards. There are graphics for almost every location, many of them animated. The screen layout and command set are typical of Brian Howarth's adventures - mostly two word commands.
