	An early American Football strategy game from the same stable as Kevin Tom's pioneering Football Manager, which gives the player the role of Head Coach of an NFL American Football team and the responsibility of building up the squad by trading players and draft picks, selecting the offense, defence and kicker and calling the plays each week during the regular season games. Games are played out with simple graphics depicting rush, line plunge and pass plays as well as field goal attempts. Successful teams advance to the playoffs and possibly to the Super Bowl. An unusual feature is the College Draft in which draft picks were used to select new players for the next season. The master "Head Coach" would aim to win the trophy in three consecutive seasons on the highest level of the game.
