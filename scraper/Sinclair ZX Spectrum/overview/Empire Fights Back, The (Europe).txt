	The Empire you fight for has been weakened significantly in recent years, and its space has now been filled with mines by the rebels. You have been sent out in the Air Wolf 2000, and must disable these mines by entering their 'sweet spot' down the centre. Once inside you must control your space droid so as to disable all the core spots. There are many patrol drones inside each mine - avoid these at all costs. There are five mines in total, the first four of which can be attempted in any order.
