	Road Racers is a simple racing game. There are just two keys to use in this game and they steer left and right. There's no accelerate key and no brake key - you start moving and you keep moving. You start in a maze and the object is to steer your car around the maze collecting flags. For each flag you are awarded ten points.   If you don't steer and you come to a corner then the game steers for you, there's no crashing into walls. Gameplay is really about turning when you want, not when the game makes you, well that and avoiding other cars.    There are three other cars and they start at the bottom of the maze at the same time as you. They travel at the same speed as you, they home in on you, they are very hard to avoid and crashing into them is the end.You get three lives and a bonus if you get 1000 points.
