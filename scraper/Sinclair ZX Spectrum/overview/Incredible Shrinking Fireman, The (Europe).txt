	Sid the Fireman's life is ruined when he falls into a shrinking machine, whilst dealing with a fire at a shrinking factory. To return to his full glory, he must find five parts of a stretching machine.    The end result is a side-view arcade adventure, in which obstacles must be used to clear paths to obtain all five parts. Many screens have multiple exits, which are not always obvious. Ghosts and ghouls  on fixed patterns must be avoided.
