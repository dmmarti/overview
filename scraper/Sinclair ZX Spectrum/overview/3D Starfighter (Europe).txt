 3D Starfighter is a 3D shoot-'em-up where you must using a set of cross hairs shoot the rapidly approaching enemy craft, before they career into you and drain your shields. Use your lasers sparingly, for they also drain your energy.  The player is in the role a special agent whose mission is to deliver the Complete Hostile Alien Obliteration System (CHAOS) weapon to the population of a distant planet overrun by hostile aliens. Clear each space zone of hostiles before you encounter the ultimate goal to destroy the enemy Battlestar.
