	The Neverending Story II is a bizarre platform game which is largely based on the movie. The concept is simple- you're Bastian, and are called forth once again by the Childlike Empress to save Fantasia, the Land of Dreams.    The game itself is indeed a platformer where you have to outrun giants (as in the movie) or push them over ledges. With every level you will be awarded with another advancement in the plot, usually a few pages written on a "book".
