	Tour 91 is an action cycling game from Topo Soft (like Perico Delgado Maillot Amarillo, the other cycling game of this company).    You must choose a cyclist and compete in a cycling race of four stages. The first stage is against the time. The second stage is a plane stage. The third stage is a mountain stage, and the last stage is a sprint stage. Before competing, you have the option to practise each individual stage.
