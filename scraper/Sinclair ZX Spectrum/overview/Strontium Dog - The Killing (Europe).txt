	Mutant bounty hunter Johnny Alpha makes the leap from the pages of 2000 AD to the Spectrum in The Killing, an action game based on a storyline from the comic.    The Killing is an annual competition, where the galaxy's most notorious criminals and murderers meet to fight to the death. Johnny Alpha joins the contest with two goals- to kill all the criminals (and collect the bounty on their heads) and to get to the evil despots organizing the bloodsport.    Seen from above, the player controls Johnny on his way through a maze of more than 200 rooms. 93 other contestants are present in the maze, and all must be vanquished to win. Most can simply be shot with Johnny's blaster. Some encounters based on situations from the comic require a different approach though- ambushes await at the medical stations, and Johnny must fire an electro flare into a station to knock out the occupants. Special enemies include the evil android Steelkreeg and cunning killer Barnak Spraks, who enjoys playing dead, waiting for his moment to strike.
