 3D Tank Duel is an early first-person shooter similar to Battlezone. The player controls a tank on a battlefield and the goal is to blow up all the enemy tanks. Radar is on the top screen, and is useful for searching enemies, showing where the enemy tanks appear. The player has unlimited ammo, but accuracy is important. The game has a pseudo-3D view and coloured landscape. Controls are simple, allowing the player to move and fire.
