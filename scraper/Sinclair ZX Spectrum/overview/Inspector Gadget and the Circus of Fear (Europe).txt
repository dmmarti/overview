	When the International Circus comes to town, a mysterious series of disappearances begin, and Inspector Gadget is called into help. Once his involvement is discovered, Penny and Brains are kidnapped, making Gadget's task bigger. This involves getting through each side-scrolling level, avoiding the meanies by jumping them, and reaching the final target. There are many holes which lead to different sections of levels. The C64 version adds an icon system allowing you to collect and use your gadgets.
