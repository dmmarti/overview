	Players have to guide a skier down the piste in the specified time limit. The ski is against a competitor but the clock is the main enemy because if the player doesn't cross the finishing posts in time it is game over.    The controls are fairly simple- left and right on the joystick rotates the skier and the fire button propels the player character forward with his sticks. Avoid obstacles such as trees, gates or log cabins.
