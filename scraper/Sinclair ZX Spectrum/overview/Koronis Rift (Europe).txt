	You play as a techno scavenger in the year 2049, exploring the Koronis Rift, in one of Lucasfilms earliest games.    The Ancients abandoned the planet, leaving behind many different artifacts and ships, which you can loot. Send your droid to retrieve modules and try to figure out what the ancient technology is for. It could be batteries, shields or even weapons, to help you fight the trigger-happy saucers that want you dead.    The game uses fractal graphics, the terrain is vast and detailed, and the story behind it is quite complex, considering the type of game.
