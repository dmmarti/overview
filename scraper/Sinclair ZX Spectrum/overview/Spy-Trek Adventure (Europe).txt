	As Mike the Spy, you must explore several European countries, in search of some all-important plans. This will involve getting onto a plane using fake ID, flying without a plane to Switzerland, and then onto Venice. Objects you will encounter include an umbrella, an onion, and a fishing line.    This adventure is written using GAC (Graphic Adventure Creator); as such, most of the screen features visual representations of your surroundings, with text input at the bottom of the screen. Commands are object-sensitive - if you have just GETted a hat, WEAR IT will mean 'WEAR HAT'. The standard commands are joined by a few which you will only need in one situation. Simple directional commands (w, s, up and so on) are used less frequently than in most IF games.
