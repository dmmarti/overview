	Nether Earth is arguably the first classic real time strategy. In a distant future there is a war between humans and ancient race of aliens called Insignian. On mysterious planet there are four bases to conquer and to win a war - Kerberus, Tarras, Faretra and Diolkos. Only way, how to fight, is to use factories to build giant battle robots, similar to Mech units in other games. Commanding robots, capturing factories and defeating enemy in realtime - is primary goal for player.    In Nether Earth is player controlling small flying robot, instead of mouse cursor in Dune 2 and later RTS games. With this robot you can enter a factory, design your unique battle robot from few parts like wheels, antigrav, radar, laser gun or nuclear weapon. After that you have to command your robot. Artifical Intelligence is great for a time, but in though times is possible to control robot manualy. Every captured factory means difference in tactics, because of power ballance. Computer AI has no advantage of you, its pure strategy in real time.
