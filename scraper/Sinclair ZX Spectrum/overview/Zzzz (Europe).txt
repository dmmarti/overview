Zzzz is a single player text adventure game with graphics. The story starts with the player falling asleep after an especially hard day. They wake in the dreamland of Zzzzz and must find their way to the border post in order to escape back to reality. The game screen has a central picture. Beneath the picture is the descriptive text and at either side are icons for showing the current score, manipulating items and navigation, no more typing Go North', and exiting the game.
