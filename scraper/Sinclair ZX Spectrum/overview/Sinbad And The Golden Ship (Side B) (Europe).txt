	In their war against the Greeks, the Persians constructed a Golden Ship to give them the advantage. Alas, before reaching land a tentacle attacked the captain, damaging the ship and throwing him into the sea. As that captain, you must return to your ship, work out what's going on, and reach some dry land, and then the bulk of this two-part interactive fiction with graphics title begins.    Tasks include escaping past quicksand, casting spells, clearing a ravine and navigating through caves. The commands include standard movement, searching and inventory functions, as well as lots more to work out for yourselves, aided by over 100 illustrations.
