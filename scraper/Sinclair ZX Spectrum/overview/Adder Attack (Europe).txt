 Adder Attack is a simple arcade game. The player must collect golden nuggets and avoid deadly snakes. The dangerous lethal blue snake is also trying to collect nuggets; if given the chance, he will eliminate you... but he has valuable opals. Occasionally he drops one and the player can pick it up for an extra 100 points.  Adder Attack has simple controls, only 4 keys to move. Graphics are 2D, a characteristic of early ZX Spectrum games.
