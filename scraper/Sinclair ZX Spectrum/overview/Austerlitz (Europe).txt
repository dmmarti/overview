This was the second in Lothlorien's Warmaster series of Strategy wargames and covers the battle in 1805 when Napoleon defeated a combined Russian and Austrian Army at Austerlitz.    In the game, you command Napoleon's forces - either directly or through a number of computer-controlled Corps commanders. Infantry and cavalry units are available for both sides (no artillery), each with varying degrees of strength and morale, with terrain effects playing an important role in their effectiveness. The game also features 'fog of war', where only those enemy units spotted by your advanced units or those encountered before combat, are revealed.
