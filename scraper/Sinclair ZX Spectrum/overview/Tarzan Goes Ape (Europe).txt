	You play Tarzan, who the witch doctor has turned into a monkey. To change back to his human form,  you need to collect six ingredients - necklace, mask, plant, crossbones, a bottle, and gem - and place them in his cauldron. While you are doing this, you deal with various forms of wildlife; such as snakes, birds, lizards, and cannibals; by stoning them to death. Fruit can be picked up for bonus points. There are two types of skulls that are scattered through each level.  One that gives you reverse controls, and one that causes loss of life. When Tarzan has obtained all six ingredients, you proceed onto the next level. In between these, you play a bonus level where the object is to collect a number of gems before time runs out.
