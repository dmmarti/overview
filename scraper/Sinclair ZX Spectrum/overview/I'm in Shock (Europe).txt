	Having travelled the galaxy in an attempt to defeat an alien race, you return home to find that they have taken over and destroyed your world. Still, while you're still alive, there is hope for the way of life you know and love.    From the bottom of the screen, you shoot upwards towards a wave of aliens who float around the top section of the screen, gradually moving towards the bottom, which would mean losing a life. Although some can be shot directly, the main trick is to use an array of diagonally-angled blocks to deflect shots upward to hit them, often off more than one of them. Control is via the keyboard, but (as with many early Spectrum games) a wide range of keys can be used.
