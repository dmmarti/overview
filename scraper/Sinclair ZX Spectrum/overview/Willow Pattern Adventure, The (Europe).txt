Willow Pattern is an action game inspired by the characteristic willow pattern design used on ceramic kitchenware since the end of the 18th century, inspired by the patterns on Chinese porcelain. The in-game graphics and locations are taken from the original willow pattern painting. The game's storyline takes its inspiration from the legend invented to promote sales of the patterned houseware. Chang and Koong-Shee are in love. Problem is Chang is a clerk and Koong-Shee is a Princess. To make matters worse she is being forced against her will to marry a merchant called Ta Jin and being held in the large palace grounds of a Mandarin palace. You play Chang and you must enter the Palace grounds, get a key and find the hiding place of the Princess to rescue her out of the grounds and take her far away in a boat. Guarding the Princess, scattered around the grounds are giants who block the paths and some even throw swords at you. You start your quest unarmed but swords can be found which are thrown at the giant guards. Swords are limited so careful use of them is required but a dead giant will leave one behind. Some bridges will need crossing which leads to a arcade sequence where you must jump over rocks while avoiding giants reaching down for you. Touching a giant or getting hit by a sword loses one of five lives. There is also treasure scattered around to be found. Willow Pattern is a flick screen maze game which is viewed from the side looking from above. The arcade sequence is viewed from the side on one screen. The joystick or keyboard is used to control Chang. As well as the main playing area you can also see how many lives remaining and a percentage of how much the game is completed.
