	In this game you take the role of a contestant in the TV game show The Krypton Factor. The gameplay is divided up into different types of mental skill including Observation in which you are told a story and shown a picture. The story is then told again but with subtle changes along with the picture which alters. You must then type in what text has changed and also what has altered on the picture. There are also mathematical puzzles involving you remembering a sequence and working out the sum quickly as the clock is ticking away. As the game progresses there are also physical tasks to do including moving the Ergobuggy around a course and finishing off with a general knowledge quiz.
