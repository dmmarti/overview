	Hopper borrows the Frogger style of gameplay, for one of many games inspired by the arcade hit.The road has 6 lanes to cross, each very densely populated with traffic. Permanent logs and temporary turtles are used to get across the river, and reach one of the 5 homecells. After filling all of them the game moves up to a higher difficulty level. A range of keys can be used for each control function.
