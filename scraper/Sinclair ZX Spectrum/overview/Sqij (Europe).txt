Sqij has found out that the key to eternal life is the Enertree, that sits in the Lotz-Too-Weet cave, deep in the caverns of Pylpapa. Problem is the tree is scattered over the caverns in six pieces and need to be collected and placed back in the cave. In this flick-screen, side view maze game, you control Sqij as you explore the caverns for the pieces of the Enertree while avoiding or shooting various nasties that live there. If you touch a nasty or the sides of the caverns then you lose part of an energy bar and when it reaches zero it is game over. In various parts of the caverns are laser doors and these can only be passed through with a pass. To get a pass you must collect three Doodlefoodle fruits and take them to one of three Dispensa-Monsta's. A pass can only be used once.
