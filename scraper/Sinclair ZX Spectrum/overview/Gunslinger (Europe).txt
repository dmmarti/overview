Gunslinger is set in the old wild west as you take the role of Kip Starr, a retired Texas Ranger and you have to rescue your friend from being hanged by the Mexicans. You start your adventure stranded in the desert and you explore the surrounding areas which will see you having to face Indians, cross wastelands, explore mineshafts and ghostowns, and have a shoot out with the Dalton Brothers. The game is a graphics text adventure where you see text describing your locations with a picture. You can either use the keyboard to type in commands to interact with your surroundings or use the joystick to move an arrow to select commands.
