 You are the evil Dr. Vargon and it is your mission to destroy the Human Race so they will stop destroying innocent aliens. 1999 is a side view horizontal scrolling shooter where the screen scrolls constantly from left to right and you have to destroy or avoid any spacecraft that fly towards you. As you avoid and shoot you will also face various end of stage bosses to move on to the next stage. Small icons fly past your ship and if shot allows you to choose various upgrades or points bonus like increased fire-power or auto-fire.
