	Your mission here is really obscure. You must destroy the evil Count Dracula who is devastating the region. The scenario of your nightmare will be the Castle of this malevolent personage.  Throughout 95 horrifying rooms you will be besieged by his slaves, try to avoid them and obtain the greater amount of food as possible. If you reunite the 5 keys and you introduce them in its 5 corresponding bolts you would have done a very important part of the mission. In order to obtain each key you must find a certain object and fix it in the "generator by pedals", if you do it well you will be able to jump the enormous pit. The second part of your mission consists in opening the 6 magical counter-windows pressing the suitable switches. Finally, search for the hammer and the stake and walk quickly to the superior part of the castle to take the cross. At this moment you will be teleported to the space to get rid of the final confrontation in which you will be able to use the laser weapon and the self-propelled knapsack.
