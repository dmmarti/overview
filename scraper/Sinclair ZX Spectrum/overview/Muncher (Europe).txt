	Muncher was one of the many Spectrum games to use the Pac Man game concept. The main change here is that the booth in the centre contains bonus fruit, instead of launching the ghosts, and that a key must be picked up to open it and grab the fruit. As ever, you must avoid the ghosts and collect the dots, with power-pills on offer so as to make the ghosts edible, for bonus points as so as to buy some time.
