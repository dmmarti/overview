	In this Game you play the role of 4 different Time Lords each named Dr What, Dr Where, Dr When and Dr Why. The different doctors are in separate time zones but can help each other out by altering history to aid a doctor in the future. The gameplay involves you jumping over platforms and picking up items which are used to solve various puzzles throughout the game. The game is based on the B.B.C science fiction show Doctor Who but names have been slightly altered as it isn't licensed.
