	This game lets you play snooker from a bird's eye view of the table. All the game play is here from putting spin on the cue ball, to judging how much power to hit the cue ball with, and also nominating a colour after a legal pot. Also in the game there is a practise mode, where you can place the balls on the table as you wish. Action replays are provided.
