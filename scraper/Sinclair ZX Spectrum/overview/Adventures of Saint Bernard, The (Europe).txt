 The Adventures Of St. Bernard is a single player arcade style game.  The player takes the role of a St Bernard rescue dog called Brandy and starts with a distress call being received.

On some levels there is the added hazard of pools of freezing water.  The game can be played entirely with the keyboard, there are only three controls Left, Right, and Jump.
