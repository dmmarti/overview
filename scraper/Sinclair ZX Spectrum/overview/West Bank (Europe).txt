West Bank is a clone of Bank Panic. The player is inside a bank with twelve doors. Bandits as well as harmless customers enter, and you have to shoot the right people at the right time, as hurting the innocent or drawing too early results in a loss of the player's life as well. As levels change, new enemies and behavior are introduced resulting in new threats. Collecting enough cash deposits leads to a completion of a stage, after which a duel with outlaws follows. However, the rules are not different, as players who pull the trigger too early will have no success.
