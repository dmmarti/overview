	There are three distinct sections to this space shooter. The first is Galaxians-inspired, with waves of aliens coming down the screen towards you firing at you, with your craft able to move vertically or horizontally (wrapping around sideways). Section 2 involves moving down the screen whilst avoiding a multi-directional asteroid field. The final phase of the game involves reaching a target in the centre of the screen, whilst avoiding a constantly tracking Cyborg unit and having to reach the bottom of the screen to refuel. These then loop with increasing difficulty.
