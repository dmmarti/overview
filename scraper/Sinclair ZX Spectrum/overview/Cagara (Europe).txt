	A Gypsy has placed a curse on you, shutting you out of your castle and trapping you in a sphere. To get back to your normal self you must find the Chalice of Cagara and return home with it.    The game is viewed from above, and sees you move through various maze-like sections in order to find the chalice. Contact with enemies is fatal, but your hamster Eric has helicopter blades, and can be released to see them off. Later you can collect a sword allowing you to stab enemies.
