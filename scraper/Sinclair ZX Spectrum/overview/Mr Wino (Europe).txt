Mr Wino is trapped in his own nightmare after a night out getting drunk and falling asleep in his home. To escape from this nightmare and wake up, you must control Mr Wino in this flick-screen platform game and collect all the bottles on each level made up over various screens to open barrier to the exit. Some bottles collected will open doors blocking exits and each screen needs to be completed before his air gauge that is slowly decreasing runs out. Moving around the various screens are creatures and if these are touched then you lose one of three lives. Certain objects also need avoiding like spikes and moving pillars with moving platforms to encounter.
