	It's obvious right from the title that Komando II was inspired by the classic Commando. The main objective of this game is to guide your soldier through the eight territories contaminated by deadly radioactivity. At the end of the last territory is a helicopter that will take you back to your homeland is Slovakia.     Each territory is filled with military installments so expect to see a lot of bunkers, watchtowers, tents, hangars, fences, foxholes, vehicles and also one tank. You start the game armed with a bunch of grenades and the "Curevoj" machine gun (equipped with an unlimited ammunition) but it's possible to get some special weapons. Just find a bound prisoner (there are few in every territory), release him free and you'll be awarded with a limited supply of grenades, bazooka or flamethrower. All these weapons will be really useful because the number of enemies is endless and they're not only shooting but sometimes also throwing grenades or playing with the flamethrower. There are also two main differences compared to original Commando is your soldier won't die during the contact with enemy soldiers and the game is time limited. This time limit is represented by slowly but constantly growing  of radioactivity so don't stop and move forward or the game is over.
