	Your mission here is to guide Jason through 15 screens in order to claim a legendary gem for himself. First you must guide the spaceship down the screen onto a teleport platform. Next you venture downwards through the caves, shooting out gaps where neccessary. The latter 2/3 of your journey are accomplished on foot. Only then can you change the course of history, and erase the by-the-numbers poetry featured in the inlay.
