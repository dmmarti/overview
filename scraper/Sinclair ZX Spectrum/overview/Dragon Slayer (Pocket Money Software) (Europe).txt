What does a brave magician do when the princess gets kidnapped Well usually nothing since we have brave knights to save her, but not this time. The mighty dragon is holding a princess captive in his lair and our brave magician must rescue her by battling hordes of evil minions in 4 levels of this almost forgotten game. The gameplay is a classical side-scrolling shoot 'em up. The enemies come in pre-determined patterns and never attack you directly. They are just there for you to avoid or shoot at. Shooting enemies gives you points but also builds up your magic points. When you collect enough magic points you'll get a spell to cast. These spell are really useful and quite fun to use. There is a bomb spell that kills everything on the screen and frog spell that lets you jump a large holes. Some spells change depending on the level of the game you're playing. Speaking of holes, you must remember that in this game holes are your biggest enemies. Most of the time the trick is finding a right place to jump from. You only have one life, you can get a extra life when you kill enough enemies, but one wrong step and you're in the hole and you're dead. Extra life doesn't count for holes.
