Overview game description files

These files are used by the Attract Mode front-end for displaying game descriptions.

A special folder (@) includes desriptions for various sytems as well. These can be used by a theme to show a synopsis of an emulated system.

These files should be placed in a sub-folder:

Attract Mode/scraper
